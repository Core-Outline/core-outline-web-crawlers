      "How to Start a SaaS Company: 6 Ingredients for Success.\n",
      "Projections indicate that the SaaS industry will be worth $700 billion by 2030, and 99% of companies will have at least one SaaS solution installed by late 2023. These numbers prove that now is as good a time as any to launch a SaaS company.The SaaS industry is already highly profitable, and its profitability is still growing. This is due to the increased adoption of SaaS solutions among small, medium, and large businesses. For instance, companies used an average of 12 SaaS solutions in 2016. By 2021, the average number of SaaS apps used in businesses rose to 110.More businesses using SaaS products means a bigger market, which you can get a slice of by introducing a SaaS solution that solves a pressing problem. Fortunately, unlike most industries, the SaaS industry has low barriers to entry. You can start a SaaS company with minimal upfront investment because you don’t need much physical infrastructure or a big team.Combine SaaS’ recurring revenue model with low overhead costs, and you can expect potentially high-profit margins. The winning mix has contributed to projections of continued SaaS industry growth.Let’s now dive into the secret sauce for starting a successful SaaS company.The first and most vital step to creating a successful SaaS company is coming up with a solution idea. Your idea must solve at least one existing problem, and an effective way to get such an idea is to look inward.What pressing issue have you experienced at work or in your personal life, and what would solve it? Your answer to this question will be your idea that you can turn into a SaaS product.If you can’t think up a problem to solve, you can look outward by actively listening to those around you to identify the problems they want to solve. For example, what recurring issue do your friends, families, colleagues, or seniors mention, and do you have a solution idea for it?However, note that you can’t pick just any problem to solve. The problem you want to create a solution (SaaS product) for must be relevant and specific. Otherwise, you may have trouble finding a market for it.The problem must also be long-term and recurring. Otherwise, people could eventually have no use for your solution, leading to negative results.The next step in starting a SaaS company is developing your SaaS product. As we’ve mentioned, you need an idea first. The product must solve an existing and recurring problem. The more widespread or popular the problem is, the more potential users you'll have, meaning a bigger target market.But there’s more to what makes a good SaaS product. Besides providing a valuable solution to user problems, a good SaaS product must be:Unique: It’s rare to find a SaaS product with zero competitors. Differentiate yourself from the competition by offering a quality product that delivers value and something unique. The unique element could be cost-effectiveness, customer support, or something equally attractive.User-friendly: Regardless of how much value a SaaS product delivers, users will avoid it if it's difficult to use. Create a SaaS product that the average user can quickly understand and navigate to experience value without assistance or extensive training.Scalable: Users should have no trouble scaling your product to match their growing or shrinking needs. From your end, your product should also be able to scale to accommodate your user base and traffic as it grows. Lack of scalability will lead to users experiencing performance issues.Reliable: Your SaaS product should be reliable with consistent uptime and speed. SaaS products with excessive downtime and service disruptions are untrustworthy, leading to high customer churn.Once you have a product idea, you should test its viability. Doing so ensures that you build a product that users want and will be willing to buy.You can test your product’s viability by performing product validation. While there are several ways to validate a product, in our experience, the best way to do it is to build a product and have target users test-drive it. However, building a fully functional prototype of your product only to have users go, “No, thank you” is expensive.A much more cost-effective strategy is to build a prototype that showcases your minimum viable product (MVP). If users show interest and positively interact with your MVP, it means people care about your product, validating your product idea.After confirming that your target users love your product idea, you can start building your SaaS product. Start with a rough sketch that showcases how your product’s interface will look.Your rough sketch will help you identify and eliminate unnecessary elements, plot user flows, and map how your product will work. Next, turn your rough sketch into a prototype: a product mockup with clickable elements.This prototype will closely simulate the look and functionality of your finished product. With this prototype, you can iron out bugs and get user and stakeholder feedback regarding what to improve, add, or remove.The prototype can then be used to develop the MVP (as discussed above). With the launch of an MVP, you can then gather user input and develop version one of your product.You can hire in-house developers, freelancers, or a development agency to build your SaaS product. Hiring freelancers costs less, while in-house teams are more convenient due to their accessibility.On the other hand, hiring a development agency is pricey, but you get expertise and a full-service team to handle all aspects of product development on your behalf. The right option for you will depend on your budget, how much expertise you need, and how hands-off you want to be.Now that you know how to develop your SaaS product, let’s dive into how to start a SaaS company, including the six special ingredients you need to successfully build a SaaS company.Starting a SaaS company costs money, and getting your return on investment can take a while. So, how will you get the money for your SaaS startup, how will you spend the money, and what will you do with your earnings? Your financial plan will answer these questions and more.A financial plan is a written document that states your company’s financial goals and how you will achieve them. It’s basically a comprehensive roadmap for your company’s finances, and you can use it to track your progress toward achieving your financial goals.Financial plans for SaaS startups typically detail revenue projections, cash flow, and expenses for specific periods. Without a financial plan, you may struggle with managing finances to ensure your business’s long-term viability.Build a financial plan for your SaaS company by following this process:Outline your financial goals: Specify the financial targets you want to hit and the timeframe to achieve each one.Identify revenue streams: Revenue streams are sources of capital for your company. Since you're a new company, you can generate revenue through pre-orders, loans, angel investments, and other sources.Forecast future finances: Your financial plan should contain a forecast of your sales and revenue generation for the upcoming year. Effective financial forecasting requires identifying relevant data, such as target market size. With the data, you can estimate how many customers you'll acquire and how much revenue each customer will generate.Estimate operating expenses: Your business will incur operating expenses as part of its daily operations. Such expenses include salaries, utilities, marketing costs, and so on. Your financial plan must list these expenses because they will eat into your revenue and profit. Listing these expenses will help with budgeting and identifying areas for cost-cutting.Determine cash flow: Create a cash flow statement that shows your cash inflow and outflow for a specific period. The statement can help you identify cash flow gaps or surpluses. It can also help you estimate how much funding you need and when your company will become profitable.Create a budget: Analyze your revenue, gross profit margin, customer acquisition costs, churn rate, and other relevant data. Use insights from the analysis to create a realistic budget that will cover your expenses for the next six months to a year. The budget should align with your financial goals and help prevent overspending.Use our financial model template to build a financial plan for achieving your goals.Your SaaS pricing strategy determines your product price and how you'll charge users to access your product. Charging very low (penetration pricing) to attract customers to your product may seem tactical, but it has its downsides. For instance, low prices can negatively affect your long-term profitability.However, if you charge too high (far higher than competitors), you could put off potential customers and lose them to more affordable competitors. You need to find the pricing sweet spot that attracts customers, profits your company, and minimizes the risk of churning. Identify the right price for your SaaS product with these steps:Analyze your product to verify its valueResearch competitors to identify how much they offer similar productsIdentify what potential customers are willing to pay for a product like yoursBased on your research, you can use a value-based pricing model, a cost-based (cost plus) pricing model, or a competitor-based pricing model. Value-based pricing involves charging a price that matches your target user’s perceived value of your product.On the other hand, cost-based pricing involves identifying the cost of building, marketing, and distributing your product. You then add a premium to that amount to create your product’s price. Lastly, competitor-based pricing involves charging a price similar to your closest competitors.Next, you need to pick how to charge. Will you charge monthly? Will you offer annual subscriptions? Or, maybe you'll charge per feature or have a usage-based pricing model. How you charge is crucial as it will affect your product’s ease of adoption. It will also impact forecasting for your SaaS financial model.After starting your SaaS company, it needs to start making money, and it can’t do that without customers. How do you get customers? With a customer acquisition strategy. This is a plan that lays out multiple tactics for attracting and converting new customers.Since SaaS companies are different from other business types, it requires a unique customer acquisition strategy. A SaaS customer acquisition plan must be purpose-driven and build long-term customer relationships. Create such a strategy with these steps:Define your target audience: Identify the people you want to target with your customer acquisition strategy. Ideally, your target audience will consist of people who need and can afford your product.Select acquisition channels: Your acquisition channels are the platforms for connecting with your target audience to market your product. Popularly used acquisition channels include social media, email, and business websites. Get the best results by connecting with your target audience via channels they already use. For instance, if most of your target audience frequently congregates on LinkedIn, then you should market on LinkedIn.Build a marketing budget: Your budget will dictate how much to spend to reach and convert potential customers. Create a marketing budget that isn’t so large that it puts your company in the red but not so small that it yields insignificant ROI.Have a well-optimized landing page: Your brand’s landing page is essential. It determines the first impressions of potential users led to your website by your marketing campaign. Make the landing page attractive, show social proof, add valuable content, and strategically place calls to action to convert visitors.Share positive reviews: User-generated content, such as testimonials and reviews, is known to influence customer purchasing decisions. Showcase customer success stories by inserting the brand logos of satisfied customers on your homepage and sharing case studies and reviews.Create valuable content: Your acquisition strategy should include content marketing, which involves sharing valuable, insightful, and engaging content. Share such content on acquisition channels to engage, educate, and convert your target audience.Monitor performance: Lastly, frequently check the performance of your customer acquisition strategy and make adjustments to improve results. Skip this step, and you could blow your marketing budget without getting the desired return on investment.With Baremetrics, you can view MRR, conversion rate, and other metrics within your dashboard to judge your customer acquisition strategy’s performance.Like every other business, companies using a SaaS business model need a written business plan. The plan for your new SaaS company will outline its marketing and sales strategies, financial projections, organizational structure, and operational details.Your startup needs such a business plan because it will help clarify and communicate your vision and strategy to potential investors and customers. It can also help articulate your value proposition and build credibility by showing your roadmap to achieve growth and success.Create a comprehensive business plan for your SaaS startup by adding these details:Mission/vision statement: The mission statement will distinguish you from competitors by clearly stating your company's core values, purpose, and overall mission. Your vision statement, on the other hand, will describe your company’s direction, long-term goals, and aspirations.Executive summary: The executive summary is a concise and persuasive overview of your business plan. It gives readers a quick and clear understanding of your company's value proposition, market opportunity, and growth potential.The product: Your business plan should clearly describe your SaaS product or service. The description should cover your product’s unique value proposition and competitive advantage over existing products.Target market: The plan should contain a detailed analysis of your target market. It should clearly state customer segments, demographics, and buying behavior so investors have a clear picture of your target audience.Marketing and sales strategy: The business plan should specify your customer acquisition, retention, and growth strategies. It should also contain financial projections for your first and second years to paint a picture of your anticipated profitability.Organizational structure: Your SaaS company can’t run itself. Specify your company structure and management strategy in the business plan. You should also add details regarding roles and who will be responsible for specific duties.Note that the most successful SaaS businesses have business plans that prioritize customer retention. That’s because happy, long-term customers ensure uninterrupted recurring revenue, which is essential for a SaaS company to succeed.Our how to start a SaaS company guide would be incomplete if it didn't mention business formation. You must incorporate your SaaS company, but first, you must pick a legal structure. The legal structure may be an LLC, C corp, or S corp.A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a flexible and relatively simple business structure ideal for small businesses and startups. C corporations (C corps) have shareholders as owners, and you can raise capital through stock sales. On the other hand, S corps have certain tax advantages, such as not paying federal income tax on profits.Before picking between an LLC, S corp, and C corp, talk to a corporate lawyer who can help you make a well-informed decision in line with your business plan. Other important legal considerations you shouldn’t ignore are:Intellectual property protectionData privacy and securityContractual agreementsCompliance with relevant state and federal laws and regulationsAfter creating your SaaS product, how do you bring it to the attention of your target customers so they buy it? That’s where a product launch strategy comes into play.A launch strategy outlines the steps to introduce your new product to your target market. It involves:Identifying target customersDetermining product pricingDeveloping and executing marketing and communication tacticsThe goal of the strategy is to generate excitement, awareness, and interest in your product. The more aware and excited people are, the more sales you can expect once your product launches, ensuring a strong start for your company.On the other hand, generating insufficient awareness and excitement for your product can lead to slow sales and trouble raising sufficient revenue to keep your startup afloat.Use the below tips to launch your SaaS product:Conduct market research: Your research should help you identify and understand your target audience. Insights from the research will also help pinpoint the best communication channels for connecting with your audience. Lastly, it will reveal the most effective content and language for engaging your audience to get them excited about your product.Create a product launch plan: Your launch plan should include the timeline and budget for your product launch. It should also list your strategy for generating buzz and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure your launch’s effectiveness.Announce your product: Let the world know your product is coming and target your messaging at prospective customers. Share your announcement via multiple marketing channels, but focus more on your target audience’s preferred channels.Launch an MVP: The MVP is a base version of your product with only core features and functionalities. Release this prototype so people can test drive your product before it launches. Besides generating awareness of your SaaS product, you can use the MVP to collect feedback on ways to improve your product before release.Perfect user onboarding: Create a simple and intuitive onboarding process that ensures new users can easily access your product and experience value. The sooner new users can try your product and experience value, the more excitement it will create, leading to free word-of-mouth advertising.Engage users: Maintain excitement levels by engaging users via social media and communication channels. Also, provide ongoing support and updates to deliver the best user experience.Congratulations! You’ve launched your SaaS company, but your journey’s not over. You have to measure your startup’s growth and performance to confirm you're on track to achieve your business goals. Tracking your results will also reveal underperforming strategies and operations you can improve to get better results and protect your ROI.Some of the most important metrics SaaS startups track include:Active Customers: This reveals how many users your product has.Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC): This is the amount you pay to acquire each new customer, including the cost of marketing, onboarding, and so on.Churn Rate: This is the percentage of customers lost within a specific period.Average Revenue Per User: This is the average amount of revenue you earn from each active customer monthly.Customer Lifetime Value: This is how much you can earn from a customer during their relationship with your company.Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): This is how much you expect to earn from your users each month.Conversion Rate: This shows the percentage of users who take your desired actions, such as signing up, booking a demo, or paying for a plan.Baremetrics is the easiest way to track the above metrics and understand the data. With the Control Center of our user-friendly SaaS reporting solution, you can see and react to real-time events and insights.

      "API-Based SaaS: Definition, Benefits & Challenges.\n",
      "Are you an aspiring SaaS founder? If so, you may be overwhelmed with your options, including API-based SaaS.In this guide, we'll help you make sense of it all by discussing what API-based SaaS is, its benefits, and its challenges. Armed with this information, you can decide the best way to move forward with your startup.API is a set of protocols, standards, and tools that allow two or more software applications to connect and share specific data. In simpler terms, APIs serve as a bridge that connects different software applications. Via the bridge, connected software can seamlessly integrate to send data back and forth.For example, you can make an HR app with SaaS API integration. Companies using the software can connect accounting software to it to manage employee payroll, benefits, and more. Adding an API to your software will increase its functionality, making it more attractive to users. Also, APIs boost user experience by eliminating the need to enter data manually or switch between apps.Example: The Baremetrics Analytics APITo paint a clearer picture of SaaS API integration, let’s look at how our API-based SaaS software works. Baremetrics is a SaaS metrics collection and analysis tool. Thanks to its API feature, you can connect our tool to other software your company uses. Doing so authorizes Baremetrics to connect and receive specific data from these other platforms.For instance, connecting Baremetrics to your payment provider will collect data regarding payments. Baremetrics can then use the data to provide insights into your monthly recurring revenue, conversion rate, and more. You can also export metrics and other data from Baremetrics to collaboration or presentation tools.Alternatively, connect Baremetrics to your customer relationship management (CRM) tool to import customer information from the CRM. Baremetrics can analyze the data to automatically provide reports regarding your annual recurring revenue, customer lifetime value, and more.API-based SaaS is a software application hosted in the cloud. Users and other programs can access the software’s features, data, and functions via an API instead of a user interface. For instance, instead of logging into your payment provider or CRM to view data, you can use Baremetrics to access the data. However, this will only work if you’ve already integrated the apps with Baremetrics via its API.API-based SaaS apps have recently become more popular because businesses can connect third-party services and applications with them. The integration allows users to seamlessly control different apps or access data from multiple apps in one location.In summary, SaaS API integration can enhance the functionality of SaaS applications by enabling various apps to integrate and work together seamlessly. End users can build custom workflows by integrating the specific apps they need to fulfill their goals. This customizability will improve your SaaS app’s functionality, leading to more productive and efficient end users.SaaS API integration works by connecting different software applications via an API so they can send data back and forth. The API provides a set of rules and protocols that allow each application to interact with the other and exchange specific data. The data exchange between the apps eliminates the need for end users to enter data manually into multiple systems.For example, you can connect Shopify to Baremetrics via our pre-built integration. You only need to create an API client in your Shopify Partners Dashboard and enter the appropriate credentials to get started.Once the connection is up and running, you can view real-time insights from your Shopify account in your Baremetrics dashboard. Other popular apps you can connect to Baremetrics include Stripe, Slack, Braintree, Recurly, and more. Do you need more convincing that building an API-based SaaS product is the way to go? If so, here are the benefits of API-based SaaS software.API-based apps improve the user experience by making it easier for users to import and export the data they need to make the most of your app. Also, users can customize their workflow by integrating specific apps to complete tasks more effectively and with less hassle.Eliminating the need to switch between apps to access specific data and allowing users to access multiple apps from a single location enhances the user experience. The better the user experience of your SaaS software, the more attractive your app will be to target users. An enhanced experience also makes your SaaS product more engaging, speeding up adoption and facilitating your onboarding process.Having an API-based app facilitates product development. Instead of building features from scratch, developers can simply integrate your software with other apps that already have the desired features.Developers will use APIs to integrate your SaaS product with the apps that have the needed functionalities pre-built and ready to use. Doing so speeds up the development process and frees up resources, allowing developers to focus on perfecting your app’s core features. For example, developers can integrate Facebook or Google authentication into your app instead of building an authentication page from scratch.Users can access API-based SaaS software via an internet-connected web browser or mobile app. If using a web browser, the user doesn’t need to install the software. The convenient access simplifies remote working and real-time collaboration among teams spread across the globe. It also promotes productivity by not limiting users to accessing the software from specific devices or locations. The flexibility of API-based SaaS software allows you to quickly and easily update the software to improve its performance. Also, you can update your software in the background without disrupting user activities or existing integrations.Even better, API-based SaaS software is highly scalable due to cloud hosting. The scalability means you can enroll thousands of new users without performance issues arising. You also don’t need to change the underlying software architecture.While API-based SaaS software has several benefits, it’s not perfect. Let's go over some of the challenges faced by SaaS companies that build API-based apps.Your SaaS product's price has to be competitive, sustainable, and fair. However, pricing can be challenging because every API-based SaaS product typically has multiple plans. Each plan needs its own price because it's a different version of your product. Figuring out how much to charge for each plan without scaring away customers or undercharging can be tricky.Fortunately, you can choose an ideal SaaS pricing model by testing different plans at different prices. Optimize your price by increasing the price in each test. A drop in demand during your tests means you've reached the ceiling of how much users will pay for that version of your product.API-based SaaS products face unique security challenges, such as the risk of a security breach if users integrate with a compromised third-party service. Also, SaaS products are prime targets for cybercriminals looking to steal sensitive user data. Such criminals usually attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the API to gain access to sensitive data.You can secure your SaaS software by implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Other security measures you can take include managing API keys properly and securing third-party integrations.The upside of SaaS API integration is the option to integrate different apps. However, since the technology and standards used to build apps can differ, users may experience trouble integrating specific software with your app product. The compatibility issues can lead to data inconsistencies and other issues.Now that you know the benefits of SaaS API integration, which API-based SaaS product do you plan to build? Regardless of the software you choose to develop, ensure it's successful with Baremetrics.\n",
      "How to Determine Product-Market Fit [Complete Guide].\n",
      "For SaaS startups, product-market fit is critical. It's so important that lacking it is the number one reason why many SaaS startups fail.We don’t want you to be one of the many SaaS founders who’ve invested time, money, and heart into starting a SaaS company that doesn't succeed. So, we’ve created this comprehensive guide on how to determine product-market fit. But before delving into how to achieve product-market fit and position your SaaS company for success, let’s clarify what product-market fit means.Put simply, product-market fit means you have a product that fits and satisfies the needs of your target market. The more your product fits your target market, the more likely your SaaS startup will succeed.A strong product-market fit will contribute to your SaaS startup’s success by ensuring the following:However, SaaS startup product-market fit does not always happen overnight. Frequently testing your product with real users and measuring their satisfaction will provide valuable insights regarding your market fit. You can use the insights to continue improving your product to strengthen its position, attractiveness, and acceptance within your target market. The Consequences of Not Finding Product-Market FitYou now know the benefits of having a strong product-market fit, but what happens if your market fit is weak or non-existent?In summary, a poor product-market fit can lead to business failure triggered by issues like:You’ve seen the benefits of having product-market fit and the dangers of not having it. Now, you're probably wondering how to achieve product-market fit. We’ve got you covered. Below is our comprehensive product-market fit checklist with steps for building a SaaS product that aligns with your target market’s needs and preferences.Understand Your Target Market's NeedsYou can’t satisfy your customers if you don’t know what they want or need. So, if you want a strong product-market fit, you must first define your target market. After pinpointing the type of people who make up your target market, research them to understand their pain points and how to solve them.There are several ways to research your target market to understand the needs of your target users. The most effective research methods use surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather information. For example, use surveys to ask target users relevant questions to understand their needs, pain points, and preferences.You can then use insights from your research to tailor your SaaS product to appeal to your target market and solve their pain points. Insights from your research can also provide ideas on how you can differentiate your product from competitors. If you skip trying to understand your target market, you risk building a product that users find valueless.Determine How Your Product Delivers ValueHow will my product deliver value? Every SaaS founder should ask this question before product development. A product delivers value by giving users benefits that outweigh its cost. The product must also meet or exceed user expectations regarding its ability to solve their problems or fulfill specific needs.The faster users can use your product to solve a problem, the more valuable they’ll consider it. Also, the more valuable a product is, the more willing users will be to pay for it.However, just because you think your product is valuable doesn’t mean it is. Verify your product's value by looking at competitors offering something similar. If these competitors are doing well, you can assume consumers will consider your product equally valuable. You can make your SaaS product even more valuable by offering features your competitors don’t have.Alternatively, get a more precise evaluation of your product by asking your target users. Do this by interacting with target users via social media or other platforms. Tell them about your product and how it will improve their lives, and see if they show interest. Get even more accurate feedback by giving target users access to your minimum viable product (MVP).SaaS product development is a multi-step process, and you can confirm product-market fit at different stages of the process. In the first stage, the product ideation stage, you can share your product idea with potential users via social media and other forums. Alternatively, use surveys to ask target members how they feel about your product idea.If potential users show interest in your product idea, that’s the first sign of positive product-market fit. You can then move on to fleshing out your product concept with a rough sketch of your SaaS product's design and interface. After using this sketch to form your product's look and user flow, you can move on to building your prototype.Prototyping involves building an MVP. The prototype will simulate how your final product will look and work. It will also have features that users can interact with and test. MVPs are excellent for getting user feedback regarding your product’s value.Also, building an MVP costs less than developing a fully working version of your product, making it a cost-effective tactic for confirming product-market fit. If users don’t like your MVP, use their feedback to improve the design and create an MVP iteration that better fits your market. On the other hand, your MVP getting overwhelmingly positive feedback is your green light to build more full-featured iterations of your product.Secure and strengthen your product-market fit by conducting user tests and iterating your product based on user feedback. Each iteration can have new features, aesthetics, and other ideas. User feedback for each iteration will let you know what works and what doesn't. Keep what works and remove or improve what doesn’t work to boost user satisfaction and secure your market fit.You can get feedback through surveys, interviews, and beta testing. You can also test your product by analyzing relevant usage metrics.Examples of relevant metrics include active users, churn rate, conversion rate, feature adoption rate, session length, and Net Promoter Score (NPS). For instance, if a new iteration has fewer active users or session lengths drop, it implies users don’t like the changes and prefer the previous iteration.Your product-market fit being strong at the start does not guarantee it’ll keep its momentum. That’s because customers and their needs and preferences constantly evolve. As such, you shouldn’t stop measuring your product-market fit.Instead, measure your product-market fit at regular intervals, either annually or bi-annually. Doing so will help your SaaS company track customer needs and preferences as they change. You can then determine if your product still fits your evolving target market. Regularly measuring your product-market fit will also provide insights into how to improve your product to fit changes in customer demands and preferences. With this approach, your SaaS company and product can remain relevant to customers and well-positioned to deliver value. It will also keep you competitive in the ever-evolving SaaS industry.Monitoring specific metrics can provide accurate insights into your SaaS startup’s performance and product-market fit success. For example, monitoring your user retention rate will reveal the percentage of customers that stayed with your brand within a specific period. If you retained most of your old customers, it means existing users find your product valuable, which is a strong indicator of product-market fit.Other relevant and valuable metrics you can track to measure SaaS product-market fit are:Several other SaaS startup metrics are available, but the ones mentioned above are the most relevant to track to determine product-market fit. Tracking irrelevant metrics will expose you to pointless data that may mislead you and lead to poor decision-making.With a SaaS reporting tool like Baremetrics, you can view and analyze your most relevant metrics in one location. For instance, you can view cancellation insights that reveal reasons users quit your product and metrics like MRR and churn rate. View these metrics and more on the Baremetrics Smart Dashboard, which shows your most relevant SaaS metrics in easy-to-understand formats.You can also take advantage of the Benchmark tool, which compares your metrics to that of similar companies. Comparing your metrics to that of successful competitors can help you understand your product-market fit status with less effort.As we’ve pointed out, product-market fit refers to how well your SaaS product meets the needs and expectations of your target market. The fastest and most accurate way to determine your product-market fit is to directly ask users how well your product meets their needs and expectations. You can do this with periodic customer surveys.Perform a product-market fit survey by first building a list of current users who’ve been with your company for at least two to three months. You should have at least a hundred users on your list, but more is better. Next, create your survey with questions like:The answers to these questions will give you a clear picture of your product-market fit. It will also reveal what your customers find most valuable about your product and who your competitors are.Alternatively, survey customers with a conjoint analysis, which is a market research technique for identifying the version of your product that will sell the best. Perform a conjoint analysis by creating a customer survey with “would you rather” questions.For instance, would you rather pay $8 per month or $80 per year for our product? Would you rather have auto-save or the option to save your progress manually? Would you rather have a blue or black background on our app?With this type of survey, you can accurately identify how well your product fits your market. The survey can also reveal ways to improve your product to achieve optimal product-market fit.In summary, periodically survey users to stay abreast of your current product-market fit. Surveys can also provide insights into customer preferences that you can incorporate into your product to strengthen your product-market fit.Hopefully, you now understand how to determine product-market fit for your SaaS product. Don’t forget that making decisions in a vacuum is the enemy of achieving product-market fit. Make data-driven product development decisions by researching and understanding your target market’s needs and preferences.With Baremetrics, you can easily access all the customer insights you need to get your SaaS startup on the right track to success.

      "Churn Analytics: 3 Insights That Can Help You Increase SaaS Revenue.\n",
      "For SaaS and subscription companies, churn most often refers to users or revenue lost and is usually represented with either a percentage or dollar amount. There are two main types of churn: Customer churn = customers lost over a period of timeRevenue churn = amount of gross revenue lost over a period of time There’s different formulas out there, but here are the ones we use at Baremetrics:Customer churn(Canceled Customers in the last 30 days ÷ Active Customers 30 days ago) x 100Revenue churn(MRR Lost to Downgrades & Cancellations in the last 30 days ÷ MRR 30 days ago) x 100Both types of churn provide value and insight into what’s going on, but revenue churn is generally the one you want to focus on more, especially if you offer a larger variety of plans. Losing customers is always bad, but the value of the customers you are losing is important to monitor. For instance, if your revenue churn suddenly increased one month, it’d be helpful to know if that was the result from the loss of several smaller customers or a single, big customer. Understanding churn rates across different customer segments can provide valuable insights around who’s churning, when they’re churning, and why they’re churning. A great way to do this is by segmenting your churn rate by attributes such as customer size (small, medium, enterprise), industry, audience, or geographic location. For example, check out this 6-month comparison of Revenue Churn between B2B and B2C customers. In December 2022, the cohorts had a similar churn rate. Two months later, B2C churn spiked and remained significantly higher than B2B churn until April 2023. After that, B2C churn continued to decrease while B2B began to increase.With this information, you could dig deeper into which customers were lost during this period and start to identify trends (more on this in the next section!)Want to try segmenting for yourself? Play around in our live demo, no log-in required. Which missing features are costing you the most customers?Which competitors are costing you the most money? Are we attracting the right customers in the first place? There’s so many potential reasons why a customer might cancel their subscription. But if you can narrow down the possible reasons to a short list, you can better understand which reasons are costing you the most revenue and therefore, where your team should be prioritizing focus. Based on our data, some of the most common reasons for cancellations in SaaS include:Too expensiveTechnical issues with productCustomer is switching to another productCustomer is not sure how to use the productCustomer is shutting down the businessInsights around cancellation are some of the most actionable insights you can get. For example, a customer that’s canceling because they feel the price they’re paying is too high for value they’re getting could be convinced to get on a call for a demo of the product, whereas a customer that shutting down their business is most definitely a lost cause.Don’t have the time to manually ask your customers, compile their responses in spreadsheets, crunch the numbers, and send emails to incentivize them to try your product again?Our Cancellation Insights tool has your back. Try it free for 2 weeks.In a perfect world, our customers would stay with us forever. But since you can’t prevent customers from canceling, it helps to have an idea around when they’ll cancel. That way, you can better prevent (or delay) their cancellation. You can find this easily in Baremetrics. Our Customer retention table shows you when customers when in their lifecycle customers are churning. As you look from left to right, you can see what percentage of customers added in a particular month remain in subsequent months.One handy way to use this is to compare the longevity of customers using your different products. For example, below is a table of our customers who use our revenue recovery dunning tool, Recover. Over these 6 months, retention is quite solid! The takeaway here is that Recover provides a ton of value to our customers. If we want to reduce churn and increase retention, getting more people to sign up for Recover on top of their Baremetrics account would likely be successful. To take this a step further, we could do similar comparisons between different add-on products and launch a campaign promoting the most popular product.By leveraging these kinds of insights, you can develop targeted strategies to reduce churn, improve customer retention, and ultimately increase your SaaS revenue.Baremetrics makes it easy for you to not only get these insights, but to take action on them, as well.

      "How uSERP Maintained Team Productivity While Growing Their Team 7x in 3 Years.\n",
      "Over the past three years, we’ve 7x our growth at uSERP, transforming from a small boutique digital PR and SEO agency to a powerhouse team committed to changing the link building narrative.At the heart of our evolution lies core values that guide every decision we make. We bias towards action, fostering a culture of curiosity and continual learning.We strive for daily improvement and fulfillment, harnessing the collective power of a team that’s unwaveringly committed to each other, our mission, and our company’s ambition to become a household name in SEO.Our vision is clear and compelling: to scale rankings, traffic, and revenue for the fastest-growing companies through unattainable backlinks and experience-backed SEO strategies.But we’re not just building an agency — we’re building people. Our vision extends to nurturing our team members and transforming entry-level learners into seasoned specialists, managers, directors, and executives.We aim to foster a culture of ownership, teamwork, and passion — where everyone feels empowered to learn, grow, and excel. And this is our story about how we grew our team at uSERP 7x in 3 years, all while maintaining team productivity.Here are a few quick facts:uSERP launched in Q4 of 2019 with a single client.In our first year, we achieved $80k MRR with three full-time people and a few part-time contractors. In 2023, we now have a 50+ person team.We’ve raised $0 in funding by bootstrapping with a lean team from the ground up.Our growth stems from a mix of inbound and outbound marketing/sales.Our team is fully remote.Scaling a team is an exciting yet complex process. And every company encounters its fair share of challenges along the way. Sadly, nobody is immune to growing pains.As uSERP grew exponentially, we faced several hurdles that tested our resilience and adaptability.So let’s dive into some of the common challenges businesses confront during team expansion and shed light on how these issues have impacted our journey at uSERP over the last three years.When scaling a team, maintaining the company culture you worked so hard to build is essential and challenging.A strong company culture creates a sense of identity, belonging, and motivation among employees, ultimately driving productivity and success. And as new members join the ranks, there’s always a risk of diluting the core values that make your organization unique.The result? Potential inconsistencies in behavior, expectations, and decline in the overall work environment.Nurturing culture and fostering a sense of belonging among team members sits within our core values at uSERP. So from day one, we’ve always prioritized maintaining this culture by:Organizing team-building events (online cooking classes, trivia, etc.) and building open communication channels.Communicating our mission, vision, and values from day one.Focusing on hiring people that align with our company culture.In a remote team setting, communication is the linchpin that holds together seamless operations, fruitful collaboration, and a cohesive work environment.As the size of your team expands, it becomes more difficult to maintain clarity and understanding among an increasingly diverse group of individuals.While small teams can often rely on casual Slack messages and impromptu meetings to stay informed and aligned, this approach becomes increasingly inadequate as your team grows.For instance, as our team at uSERP expanded across borders, we encountered communication challenges requiring us to adapt our strategies — especially as we onboarded employees in virtually every time zone.Navigating the complexities of communication in a larger remote team requires a more structured and strategic approach (e, g. daily check-ins and product management tools) to ensure continued success.Teams thrive with a delicate equilibrium of workloads spread across all members.As a leader, the last thing you want is to pile all your work on one person’s plate. Even if they are one of the team’s strongest members, they’re still human and can only handle so many tasks at once.Avoid this bottleneck by delegating and spreading the workload as evenly as possible. Of course, this process is easier said than done.And once you introduce new tasks and responsibilities (not to mention headcounts), it demands another skillful rebalancing of workloads and resources.The goal? Maintain balance so your entire operation continues functioning like a well-oiled machine, despite the growing demands.As we continued to grow different teams within our organization, we faced the challenge of making sure that each team (and member of that team) had the right balance of workload to achieve peak performance without sacrificing the quality of work.It takes a bit of trial and error to get it right. And honestly, it’s still something we continue to perfect. To help tackle this issue, we:Invest in technology and automation to streamline processes and create a structured onboarding process.Provide training and development opportunities for our team to enhance their skills.Conduct regular workload assessments to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.Discerning the optimal time to bring in new team members is a pivotal decision when scaling a team. This simple decision, on the surface, carries significant implications for the success of your growth strategy.Hire too soon, and you may strain your financial resources, putting undue pressure on your budget. Wait too long, and your existing team could become overburdened, leading to burnout and a potential dip in productivity.Recognizing that growth can be unpredictable, we adopted a flexible hiring strategy. A mix of full-time, part-time, and contract positions allows us to adapt swiftly to fluctuations in demand.And keeping a pulse on existing team workloads and their capacity has worked wonders. If the workload consistently exceeded capacity, it indicated that our team was stretched too thin, and we knew it was time to bring in reinforcements.Did we get the hiring decision right every quarter? No. But over the long haul, we’ve started identifying patterns that signal it’s time to hire. Some of those things include:An uptick in customer complaints or negative feedback.Team members are consistently working overtime.Employee stress levels are at an all-time high.There’s no capacity to take on new projects.Project delays due to missed deadlines.There’s a decline in the quality of work.While we didn’t make the right hiring decisions every time, recognizing these signs helped us make more informed decisions and better manage our team’s growth.Hiring new members takes center stage in the quest to scale a team. However, an equally crucial yet sometimes overlooked aspect is the retention of your top talent.Why? Holding onto your high-performing employees is the secret recipe for enhancing your team’s productivity, continuity, and morale. They inspire other team members and always bring their A-game.And not to mention that losing a high-performing team member can be a significant setback for any organization.The turnover costs go beyond the financial implications of recruitment and training. You’re also losing accumulated knowledge, introducing disruption to team dynamics and the potential to impact client relationships.At uSERP, we’ve learned that employees will stick around for the long run when they feel valued. Small details make a difference — like a thank-you email after a hectic week.Never underestimate the power of recognition for hard work and achievements. Invest in their growth if you have a shining star on your team.As we embarked on the journey of team expansion, maintaining productivity was a challenge that commanded our attention daily.Rapid growth, while exciting, can stir the waters, disrupting established workflows and impacting team dynamics. However, we knew we could scale with the right formulation of strategies in place.Here are the five key strategies that have guided uSERP in maintaining productivity throughout our rapid growth.The recruitment process is the first building block in constructing a cohesive team and preserving your company’s culture.As we mentioned earlier, we place immense importance on hiring the right talent, recognizing that our team’s productivity and our company’s success hinge on this critical process.So we cast our recruitment net wide, hiring international talent as independent contractors and posting on various job search sites to attract a diverse pool of candidates. This approach has allowed us to bring together a fully remote team that’s skilled and brings diverse perspectives, enriching our problem-solving and innovation capabilities.Our hiring process is thorough yet efficient. The average time to fill a position is about a month, including paperwork and determining start dates. However, we maintain the flexibility to accelerate this process as needed. We also typically have candidates on deck, allowing us to respond swiftly to emerging needs.Over the last year, our offer acceptance rate has hovered around 75%, indicating that our value proposition resonates with potential hires. And our new hire turnover rate over the last four years has been maintained at a low of 9.09%.A year-by-year breakdown shows a declining trend in voluntary new hire turnover:20% in 2020 (5 hires, 1 exit after 2 years).0% in 2021 (3 hires, 1 involuntary exit within the same year).3% in 2022 (25+ people, 1 voluntary, 2 involuntary exits within the same year).Importantly, we haven’t lost a new hire yet in 2023. It speaks volumes about our hiring process’s effectiveness, supportive onboarding (more on that in a bit), and work environment.At the end of the day, “hiring right” isn’t just about filling a vacant position. It’s about finding the right fit for your team and culture, which demands careful consideration and strategic action.Did you know that organizations with a robust onboarding process can increase new hire retention by 82% and improve overall productivity by 70%?It might sound too good to be true, but a well-structured onboarding program can help new team members:Feel more connected to the team.Contribute to productivity sooner.Get up to speed faster.And we’ve experienced firsthand the transformative impact of a solid onboarding process on team productivity. So what does it look like?Our onboarding process is meticulous and thorough, spanning three months:New hires undergo a structured two-week training program featuring tests and exercises in each module.Check-ins with direct managers conclude each module, offering clarification and immediate feedback.New hires are encouraged to track their time during training to identify time-consuming tasks and potential areas for improvement.We gradually introduce them to their roles, fostering confidence and competence.The average training time per employee is 2-3 weeks, but highly experienced hires often finish sooner.This structured onboarding program accelerates new hire integration, expedites their time to productivity, and nurtures a culture of continuous learning and improvement.But it wasn’t always sunshine and rainbows. Navigating the landscape of onboarding tools was a daunting task. What proved to be a perfect fit for one startup fell short for us. That’s where platforms like Matchr come in handy, offering bespoke solutions that align with your specific needs.Since we focus on robust training protocols, investing in a learning management system (LMS) that could significantly improve our onboarding process made sense.But not all LMSs are created equal. Matchr helped us find the perfect solution that integrated our existing tools and checked every box. This extra attention to detail has boosted the effectiveness of our training programs tenfold.The takeaway? Don’t settle for a generic, one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, entrust the experts to guide you in selecting the ideal software that perfectly aligns with your unique needs.Remember, the right tools can significantly enhance your onboarding process, accelerating new hire integration and boosting productivity.The truth is that achieving your goals can quickly become an uphill battle without effective communication. Simple collaborations morph into hurdles, misunderstandings creep in, and team morale takes a hit — a combination far from conducive to business growth.With uSERP being a fully remote team, we understood from the start that we faced an added challenge in establishing clear lines of communication. The convenience of turning to a coworker in a neighboring cubicle for quick questions isn’t an option when team members sit across the globe.But, understanding this reality allowed us to create proactive solutions and maintain the seamless collaboration our team is known for. We made it a priority to give every member of our team the information they need to do their job effectively while also feeling heard and understood from afar.For instance, our department heads host daily “office hours” via Slack. These open-door periods encourage a safe space for team members to ask questions, seek advice, or discuss ideas. It helps to promote a culture of transparency and mutual respect.In addition to these daily collaboration touchpoints, we also host weekly team check-ins. These virtual gatherings allow everyone to align on priorities, address any issues that pop up during the week, and celebrate successes.We strongly believe that teamwork makes the dream work. And these weekly check-ins allow everyone to contribute to the overarching team and organizational goals.And lastly, we make it a priority to conduct quarterly performance reviews. Studies show that 92% of employees want feedback more often than the traditional annual review.So we’ve significantly increased the frequency of our performance reviews to give our employees the regular feedback they crave and deserve.Remember, performance reviews aim to assess past performance and keep communication channels open. They should guide employees toward their career goals and, ultimately, enhance productivity and job satisfaction.As we’ve scaled, we’ve found that clear, consistent communication isn’t just beneficial — it’s essential. It helps maintain productivity, promotes a positive work environment, and makes sure everyone feels connected, engaged, and part of the uSERP family.It’s 2023, and we have a wealth of technology designed to simplify our lives, optimize our routines, and enhance our productivity.But the true challenge lies in identifying and integrating these tools to minimize manual tasks and make workflows as efficient as possible. After all, time is a nonrenewable resource, and we at uSERP are committed to using it wisely.As our team grew, we swiftly recognized the importance of streamlined processes in maintaining productivity. It wasn’t enough to add more members to the team — we needed our operations to be as efficient and effective as possible, adapting with us as we scaled.So we took decisive steps to optimize our processes. Here’s how:Minimized team meetings across different time zones and prioritized asynchronous meetings via Slack.Replaced unnecessary meetings with Loom videos, allowing team members the flexibility to consume and digest information at their convenience.Created comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) using Notion to provide a centralized, accessible resource for every team member.Harnessed the power of project management tools like ClickUp and Pipefy to maintain a clear overview of our ongoing projects and hold everyone accountable for hitting project deadlines and goals.Scaling isn’t just about growing in size — it’s about growing in efficiency, too. As technology advances, there’s always a faster way to do something.So never stop innovating. Continually assess your workflows and seek opportunities to improve repetitive tasks with business process automation solutions. With this mindset, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to maintain and even boost productivity as your headcount grows.An empowered employee is a productive employee.Simply put, empowerment breeds initiative, resilience, and a commitment to quality. It’s not enough to have more hands on deck. Each pair of hands must be capable, confident, and invested in the task.We love empowering our employees at uSERP. It’s our bread and butter. And we feel good doing it.For instance, we’ve discarded micro-management. Instead, we communicate our expectations and deliverables, leaving team members to manage their own time and tasks.This simple approach instills a sense of trust and responsibility in our team members. Plus, nobody likes a micromanager. It’s stressful and a major cause of burnout. Why do you think turnover rates are so high in the financial industry?We also champion flexibility through our ‘work-from-anywhere’ policy, accommodating all time zones. This flexibility underscores our trust in our team members’ ability to meet their responsibilities, regardless of location. It’s a clear message: we believe in your ability to deliver.And, of course, continuous learning is another cornerstone of our empowerment strategy. Regular learning and question-and-answer sessions allow our team members to hone their skills, broaden their knowledge base, and raise queries in a supportive, collaborative environment.And let’s not forget the value of team building. Our events, designed to be inclusive across different time zones, foster a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose. They’re not just a break from routine — they’re a critical tool for building a coherent, cooperative team.And most importantly, they’re fun. Yes, we did a virtual empanada baking class.An empowered team doesn’t just do more. It does better. And that’s a strategy worth investing in.As we reflect on our journey over the past three years, the results of our meticulous efforts to maintain productivity while scaling are clear and quantifiable.We’ve not only maintained productivity but also significantly enhanced it, and we have the numbers to prove it.Starting with employee retention rates, a key indicator of a productive and content workforce. Since 2020, our average retention rate has remained strong at 91%. Out of around 55 total hires, only five have left the company.A low turnover rate is a testament to our commitment to fostering a supportive, engaging, and empowering work environment in which people want to be a part.Another key marker of our success lies in our internal promotion rate. Let’s break it down:A remarkable 81.25% of senior and leadership roles were filled by individuals promoted from within our organization.Over the past four years, 25% of our team, now around 50 people, have received promotions.Looking back at 2021, when our team was composed of eight individuals, excluding the two founders, we’re proud to say that 75% of those team members have been promoted.In 2022, we hired over 25 individuals. From that pool, we’ve already promoted 30%.These stats highlight our commitment to nurturing and rewarding our team’s talent and giving credit where credit’s due.Empowerment, communication, strategic hiring, and efficient processes aren’t just strategies for us — they’re our guiding principles, driving us forward to continued success.As we look to the future, we’re excited to continue scaling, evolving, and achieving with our fantastic team at the heart of everything we do. Without our employees, we wouldn’t be where we are today.Did we do everything right? Absolutely not. But we ultimately found five simple strategies for maintaining productivity that did work. And since then, we’ve doubled down on these initiatives and continue to ride the momentum.Will these strategies work for your business? Some of them, yes. All of them? Maybe not. But it’s an excellent foundation to help get you started.Never lose sight of your organization’s core values. These will keep you humble and honest as you scale. If you keep these at the forefront of everything you do, you’re bound for success.And don’t forget that maintaining team productivity is a learning curve. Be patient. Use data to help you drive decisions. We believe in you. Maximum productivity is right around the corner.\n"

      "5 Unique, Revenue-Generating Insights You Can Get in Baremetrics.\n",
      "Without deeper insights, subscription metrics are just numbers in a spreadsheet. Insights add context, understanding, and actionable meaning to your metrics, and help you make more informed decisions that drive growth. Baremetrics is a powerful analytics platform that provides subscription-based businesses with powerful metrics and insights. In this article, we’ll break down five unique insights you can gain from Baremetrics that can help you boost revenue, improve customer retention, and ultimately build a stronger business.The amount of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) you’re earning from each plan can tell you a lot about your pricing strategy, where the majority of your revenue is coming from, what kind of customers you’re bringing in, and more. With Baremetrics, you can see this easily under your MRR breakout (see this in our live demo here 👀)Based on the above table, we can make a few interesting observations: Revenue distribution is somewhat even across our top three plans. This could mean that a decrease in subscriptions to one plan wouldn’t impact our overall MRR too much. The $1129 plan brings in almost the same amount of revenue as the $249 plan. Launching dedicated campaigns to bring in just a few more “bigger fish” could give us a healthy boost in MRR.With this kind of knowledge, you can tailor your marketing strategies, product development, and customer support efforts to focus on the tiers that yield the highest returns.Here’s a not-so-fun fact: Subscription businesses lose around 9% of their revenue every year to failed payments.Failed payments typically happen when a customer’s credit card is expired, lost, over its limit, or has the wrong information. Baremetrics helps you track which payments have failed, shows you the potential revenue loss on the line, and sends automated emails to your customers so they update their credit card information more quickly. The magic is all done in our Recover tool, which can be added on to your core subscription. Lower churn and get your hard-earned money back? That’s what we call a win-win 👏Building a successful business means being ready for anything. Looking at different financial scenarios (base-case, best-case, and worst-case) helps you think through potential solutions and be better prepared for both growth opportunities and downturns. Forecast+ by Baremetrics offers advanced scenario modeling to help finance pros and beginners alike do this quickly. The below forecast was created in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. With the three scenarios mapped out, it’s pretty clear that if the team continued business as usual, they would have run out of money in months.Not using Baremetrics yet?

Cancellations are an inevitable part of running a subscription-based business, but understanding the reasons behind customer churn can help you prevent other cancellations in the future. Cancellation Insights by Baremetrics helps you analyze the various cancellation reasons provided by your customers, allowing you to identify patterns.It also calculates the amount of revenue you’re losing to each reason automatically (circled below in red). Yikes– this company lost several customers and ~$1,948 in a month to competitors offering a lower priced option. One action they could take is to reach out to these customers and try to get more information around which competitors they switched to and perhaps even negotiate a new price. Whether it's pricing concerns, feature gaps, or reasons out of your control, understanding each reason’s potential impact on your revenue helps you prioritize where your business needs to improve most urgently, and guide your strategy accordingly.For this team, it could be worth offering a lower-priced plan these folks could downgrade to instead of fully canceling. The unique insights that Baremetrics provides are a game-changer for SaaS businesses. From understanding the revenue distribution across your plans to knowing how much you’re losing to failed payments and benchmarking your performance against other SaaS companies,Baremetrics equips you with the tools to enhance customer satisfaction, boost your revenue,  and build a thriving business– things we should all be prioritizing in the current economic climate.

      "From Crisis to Opportunity: How to Strengthen Treasury Management in the Wake of the SVB Collapse.\n",
      "The unexpected collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)  was a turn of events that many feared would rival the financial crisis of 2008. The repercussions of this failure were quickly felt across the globe, with banking stocks plummeting, markets thrown into disarray, and many feeling concerned about the stability of other financial institutions. Entrepreneurs who had been drawn to SVB for its startup-friendly terms and interest rates were left anxious and uncertain about their ability to meet their financial obligations and ensure that their employees would receive their salaries. While having loyalty to a financial institution is understandable, it is crucial for startups to remember the importance of sound treasury management. Effective treasury management ensures the company's financial stability and mitigates risks associated with relying on a single institution. Now, in the aftermath of this crisis, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, whether directly affected by SVB's collapse or not, are left wondering what measures can be taken to prevent similar impacts on their businesses. In this post, I’ll discuss the lessons that we can all take away from the crisis, tips for better cash management, how the right tools can help improve your overall treasury management, and more.In an environment marked by economic uncertainty and rising interest rates, companies face the challenge of optimizing their cash investments to balance yield and liquidity. Ensuring financial stability and operational continuity requires a strategic approach to managing excess cash, maximizing returns without compromising liquidity. Companies must rethink their cash management strategies to ensure financial stability and adapt to changing conditions. By focusing on key components of effective cash management, embracing technology and automation, and proactively addressing financial risks, companies can safeguard their cash position and maintain the flexibility needed to thrive in an ever-evolving business landscape.Regularly forecasting cash flow enables companies to anticipate future cash requirements and make informed decisions regarding investments, operational expenses, and funding needs.Ensuring sufficient liquidity is crucial for managing day-to-day operations, covering unexpected expenses, and seizing growth opportunities. Companies should maintain a cash buffer and strike a balance between maximizing yield and preserving liquidity in their cash investments.Efficient management of working capital, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory, can help companies optimize cash flow and maintain financial stability.Prudent borrowing and effective debt management can help companies leverage external financing without overextending themselves and risking insolvency. Identifying and mitigating financial risks, such as currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, and counterparty risks, can help companies protect their cash position and maintain financial resilience.Forecast+ offers an integrated solution for automating FP&A and providing treasury teams with the information they need to make informed decisions. By connecting with Xero and QuickBooks, Forecast+  streamlines forecasting and scenario planning processes. The platform's real-time data and analysis capabilities enable treasury teams to optimize cash management, mitigate risks, and drive business growth.\n"

      "Thanks to lingering effects from COVID-19, including the macro double whammy of inflation and high interest rates, we’re tackling 2023 under unpredictable economic conditions and a potential recession on the horizon. To dig into what this means for SaaS businesses in particular, Baremetrics CEO Brian Sierakowski sat down with Przemek Gotfryd, co-founder and COO of Capchase, and Jamie Maynard, Director of Strategic Originations of Capchase. Together, they discussed how SaaS companies can thrive in the year ahead, including which key metrics businesses should keep an eye on. Capchase is a non-dilutive funding solution for SaaS businesses. Founders partner with Capchase to get the capital they need to grow without having to give up a piece of their company in the process.This blog post shares some of the key takeaways from our talk with Przemek and Jamie, “Stay One Step Ahead of 2023 as a SaaS Founder.” To access the full event recording, you can do so here.When it comes to metrics, Brian’s advice is to be proactive and have a plan. After all, tracking a metric is only useful if you’re clear on what it’s telling you about your business. In addition to your usual alphabet soup of SaaS metrics, we recommend paying attention to the following metrics to signal shifts in performance that might be linked to economic factors. When we talk about trial health for SaaS and subscription businesses, we’re usually referring to two things: The frequency of new trials The quality of leads that start trials  Over the next few months, you’ll want to be on the lookout for a decrease in new trials, as well as differences in the types of companies starting trials (e.g. company size, products trialed, the role of the person trialing, etc.). Both factors can greatly impact your new recurring revenue. Churn always matters, in both prosperous times and otherwise. Whether your primary business goal is to generate cash or grow as quickly as possible, a high churn rate can signal fundamental issues in your business. It can also get out of hand if not addressed.To reduce and prevent churn, you must learn more about who’s churning, why, and the financial impact of the why.Who’s churning: Simply knowing which of your customers is churning isn’t enough to be strategic. You must dig a little deeper to stay ahead of a growing churn rate.Why they’re churning: Some of the most common reasons for cancellations we see in SaaS are technical issues, business shutdowns, uncertainty about how to use the product, and making the switch to a less expensive tool.The financial impact of the why: In the event you can’t save a customer, you should collect cancellation feedback. This feedback can help you calculate the amount of revenue lost for each reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the financial impact driven by each reason is super helpful for prioritizing your team’s focus.If manually asking people why they’re canceling and calculating the revenue lost by reason sounds tedious and time-consuming, you’re not wrong.That’s why we built Cancellation Insights. It sends automated surveys in-app or over email and does the number crunching for you. Add it to your plan or start a free trial today. Net income might sound obvious, but a lot of founders lack a clear idea of what they’re making at the bottom of their profit and loss statement over the course of the month. Founders must have a clear understanding of not only their revenue and cash flow but also expenses. This is especially important during periods of economic instability. As a first step towards improving your Net Income, consider building a scenario forecast. By forecasting your baseline, best-case, and worst-case Net Income scenarios, you can make better-informed decisions around hiring, infrastructure use, and other cost centers for your business. If you’re seeking capital or preparing to, keep in mind that capital providers look at ROI-related metrics to signal resilience and the likelihood of survival. One common example metric is the LTV (lifetime value) to CAC (customer acquisition cost) ratio. However, monitoring LTV and CAC in 2023 might look a little different than in past years. Here are two things to keep in mind: An increase in churn will decrease your LTV. Some customer acquisition channels have become cheaper recently thanks to decreased demand. However, many companies are looking to cut back on expenses, and may be harder to sell to.One way to improve your LTV:CAC in a shorter amount of time is to incentivize your customers to upgrade to annual contracts so you can get paid upfront.If you work at a larger SaaS company, you may already be familiar with the Rule of 40, or R40. It’s the idea that a software company's combined revenue growth rate and profit margin should equal or exceed 40%. Or as Jamie describes it, “year over year, top-line revenue growth.” Given its difficulty to achieve, R40 has long been used as a marker for success among large and mature SaaS companies, but that might be changing. In their 2022 Benchmark Report, Capchase found that successful SaaS companies are hitting between 80% (R80) and 110% (R110) at different stages. Among companies that go public, the best performers achieve 60%. This means that not only is R40 possible, but even better margins are possible, as well. Nonetheless, it’s important to remember that these impressive figures come from mature companies; smaller companies should think of R40+ as a destination metric to work towards. Although the economy feels rocky right now, there’s a lot of hope for the SaaS market. As Przemek points out, “Whether there might be a recession in the US, nobody knows yet. But the SaaS spend is still going to grow by 10-20% this year because digitalization isn’t going anywhere.”So founders, continue to proceed with caution. Look closely at your numbers and control your destiny, but stay open to the possibility of new growth opportunities. And in the event you want to take advantage of a growth opportunity but need capital to do so, check out Capchase and its unique approach to alternative financing.

      "Using Baremetrics for SaaS Forecasting.\n",
      "SaaS forecasting is critical for effective decision-making as your business grows. Forecasts allow you to ensure your company is moving in the right direction, but only if you use the right process and tools to build them.In this post, we’ll discuss the basics of forecasting for SaaS and subscription businesses. We’ll also demonstrate how forecasting works in Baremetrics and compare Baremetrics to other SaaS revenue forecasting options. For SaaS and subscription businesses, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is generally considered the holy grail of all metrics. In fact, maximizing MRR by increasing customer retention and reducing churn is the key to sustainable business growth. That means factoring MRR into forecasting is critical.That said, you generally don’t want to start with revenue. Instead, you start with assumptions about qualified leads, conversion rates, and other factors that impact MRR. Then you can build a forecasting model that makes sense for your SaaS business.Sales, when expressed in terms of sales bookings or sales targets, are often the contracts won. It is not governed by accounting principles.If a sales rep closed a contract of $12K for a year, his sales target/sales booking might reflect $12K in that month of contract won, but for accounting the revenue of $12K will be split over the 12 months contract term.Revenue, on the other hand, is total income including sales, and is the term usually used by accountants. Revenue can include income from other sources like rental income, interest earned on idle cash invested, and more. In short, sales is a subset of revenue. Sales forecasts and revenue forecasts are often too separate items.The first option SaaS startups usually consider for forecasting is spreadsheets. While this might be sufficient at the start, it can be challenging to maintain SaaS financial models in spreadsheets manually as a company grows. Spreadsheets make collaboration more difficult, and they aren’t easy to integrate with many different data sources. This limits both the accuracy of forecasts as well as the speed at which they can be created.Instead, SaaS businesses might consider an analytics platform like ChartMogul or ProfitWell, but these platforms only offer basic metrics forecasting options. Baremetrics has advanced capabilities like automated financial modeling, scenario planning, and forecasting using accounting data and SaaS metrics. Combined with the other analytics and engagement features, this makes Baremetrics a better option than other platforms for most SaaS companies.Here are the basic steps for forecasting SaaS sales using Baremetrics.First, you’ll want to create a financial model that’s tailored to your business. The traditional SaaS forecasting approach uses historical sales data and a growth rate assumption, but this generally isn’t the most accurate forecasting method. Instead, there are other advanced forecasting models to consider:Lead-driven forecasting uses the number of leads for a given period of time, the customer conversion rate, and the average sale price to calculate a revenue estimate for each lead source. Lifetime value forecasting leverages the estimated value of the average customer to predict future revenue. There are many ways to calculate customer lifetime value, but one method is to divide the average MRR per customer by the customer churn rate.Opportunity forecasting predicts which prospects will become customers based on where they are in the sales cycle. You assign potential close rates to different stages of the sales pipeline and estimate the potential value of prospects to predict revenue based on current sales opportunities.Once you’ve built your revenue model, you’ll want to refresh your data and forecasts regularly. While this might be challenging with spreadsheets or other basic forecasting tools, Baremetrics can incorporate accounting data and SaaS metrics to create revenue predictions in real-time. This is critical for modern SaaS forecasting, where new data is quickly interpreted to make predictions about an uncertain future — and then used to develop strategies to deal with these forecasts. You can leverage Baremetrics forecasts that use the latest data available to make better business decisions.Despite our best efforts to forecast the future, running a business will always be unpredictable. That’s why it’s important to model multiple “what if” situations your business might encounter. In short, scenario forecasting is a great way to better prepare for the future. Baremetrics allows you to input various growth and churn assumptions and make other tweaks to generate overall revenue, MRR, and customer forecasts  Using these features, here are three common scenarios you might want to model:Target scenario: The ideal outcome that you're shooting for, which is usually based on fairly aggressive assumptions.Base scenario: A conservative estimate of what your business can most likely achieve, which is often based on your average historical performance over the past few months.Worse scenario: The unlikely scenario that things go very wrong, often due to external factors outside your control.Forecast+ allows you to automatically forecast your revenues, expenses, and bank balance, giving you better visibility into your company's future.

      "Hit the Ground Running in 2023 with an Efficient Annual Budget using Forecast+.\n",
      "An annual budget projects a business’ income & expenses, assets & liabilities, and cash position over a 12-month period. Annual budgets may also be referred to as an operating plan, annual operating plan or financial operating plan depending on the company. Monitoring the variance between your annual operating plan and actual business performance is crucial for long-term planning and success. You might know the saying, 'To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail'. On a similar note, when it comes to every business decision that involves number crunching, chances are they would be performed in a spreadsheet. Finance teams have been overusing spreadsheets to the point where almost all of their activities (planning, budgeting and forecasting) is done with spreadsheets. Here are some of key challenges this over-dependence creates: Forecast+ was created with the aforementioned challenges in mind.It enables teams to use historical SaaS metrics data to forecast growth more deeply and accurately in its revenue model, create custom metrics and formulas, answer complicated questions about things like headcount, runway and more-- all while working in an user-friendly environment. In other words, with Forecast+ users can:Forecast+ simplifies the entire process of budgeting and forecasting. Hence, unlike traditional spreadsheets, budgeting and forecasting can be done using the same steps. Ideally, a twelve months forecast starting January 2023 is the budget for 2023 (although there could be an exception, which can be managed using Forecast+ as well). Once the budget is finalized and signed off by the CFO, CEO and the Board, it gets saved in Forecast+ as a snapshot.Next steps:Once the books are closed for each month, the Forecast+ team can update the actuals in the operating model for you, or it’s so simplified and automated that you can do it too with the click of a few buttons.For more on how to compare your budget vs. actual data, check out our article: Budget vs. Actual: How to Use Variance Analysis to Drive SaaS SuccessWhile incremental budgeting builds on the current year’s budget or actuals by adjusting for expected increases/decreases in the revenue and expenses, zero-based budgeting prepares the budget for the next year from zero-base (i.e. from scratch) by analyzing the budget requests of each function. While zero-based budgeting is time consuming, it does help in eliminating non-value added expenditures.Using Forecast+, you can adopt any of the above approaches to build your budgets. You can also do a combination of both approaches in building your budget. For example, certain critical items can be budgeted using Incremental budgeting whereas noncritical items can be budgeted using zero-based budgeting. As you choose an approach and start building your budget, keep in mind that budgeting is most effective when done collaboratively with leadership and lower-level employees. The budgeting process typically starts with leadership figuring the following key drivers: Scenarios to be definedEquity/Debt raise assumptionsNew product launches, geographical expansions, etc.Top-down revenue, margins and net profit expectationsThese drivers can then act as a guiding document for other departments to base their budget assumptions on. Here are some examples: ‘A capital expenditure budget is a formal plan that states the amounts and timing of fixed asset purchases by an organization. This budget is part of the annual budget, which is intended to organize activities for the upcoming year.’ (Source: accountingtools.comIdeally the overall funds company can afford to spend on Capex next year should be determined and included in BudgetIt’s worth repeating: When creating a budget, always consult, take input from, and share updates with the different teams contributing to the budget. This will ensure that the budgeted numbers are not only realistic, but more accurate, as well. Involving employees in the budgeting process creates a sense of ownership and motivation to achieve the set targets. This also helps with variance analysis in the future. If you build your budget without your team, you risk demoralizing them by coming up with numbers that are unrealistic and therefore unmotivating to achieve. Budgeting doesn’t have to be a painful experience in Excel. With the right toolkit and input from your team, it can be efficient and even exciting.

      "We Raised Prices by 250%: The Good, The Bad, and What We Would Have Done Differently.\n",
      "In April of 2022 we raised Baremetrics’ pricing.This was the first time we increased our prices since launching in 2013. We didn’t make a small correction—we increased our prices by 250%.We charge customers based on their MRR tier. When their MRR goes up, so does their price. This model works well for us since:I love this alignment since it forces us to focus on the same things that our customers care the most about, which is primarily growing the most when things are good, and staying afloat when the environment is challenging.However, even with this sliding scale we realized that the base price didn’t reflect our value. I know from working with SaaS businesses that if you’re not testing your price, you’re under priced, and if you aren’t updating prices regularly, you’re under priced.With that said,at this large percent increase we put ourselves on par with our competitors, matching the value we’re already providing and allowing us to double down on all the focus areas that matter to us and to our customers.For example, we’ve built up our team to dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to get an answer, including going “negative” by proactively reaching out to customers when we find growth opportunities for them. We’ve more than doubled our development team to deliver product improvements more quickly. And this wasn’t clear at the time of the price increase, but with the changes to economic landscape it’s become clear that many of our customers need to shift from growth mode into cash generation mode—we’ve built a team and acquired a product to help companies manage their cash runway, forecasting expenses and revenue, and proactively thinking through multiple area.As customer acquisition becomes more difficult, inflation rises, and due diligence requirements become more stringent, it’s clear that a huge part of our role moving forward is to make sure our customers have cash in the bank and a plan for both growth and profitability. Our price increase ensured that we had the team and tech in place ready to go to support our customers the moment the market changed.While many customers were (understandably) frustrated with the increase, one question came up more than any other in private conversations: “How do I do that for my business?” Here’s how we executed the price increase, how it affected our business, and why it was all worth it. Phase 1: Experimentation Phase 2: Notifying customers Phase 3: Customer conversations and negotiationsEvery situation is different (which is why I’m always happy to take a call to apply lessons directly to your business,) but for us one major factor was that we had not raised prices in about 8 years.This put us in the spot where we really needed to start with “price discovery”—we had to completely separate ourselves from the current pricing, both from our business model, and the resulting price points.We considered switching our tier based pricing, and also changing the way we priced our add-on products (Recover, Cancellation Insights, and Flightpath)—but for the reasons outlined above we decided to keep the tiers, and in order to keep our experiment clean we decided to keep the same pricing relationship with our add on products. For example, while Metrics and Recover are tier based, Cancellation Insights is not—we definitely asked “why not?” internally.The deciding factor of keeping everything in the same proportion was the fact that we had so little data around the rough price point that we should land on that also modifying packaging would make it harder to determine if we’re in the right place.We had two hints of where to start:We could see our competitors pricing, and while you should never base your price solely off of a competitor, if your competitors are 200% to 300% above your price, that’s a clue that there’s room to increase.Baremetrics had previous pricing experiments that we could review the data from. The tests were inconclusive, but again since we’re operating from nothing, any hints are helpful.To get started we needed to understand the rough multiple of where we were playing. In order to do this we did many A/B/C tests on landing pages and our marketing site. In order to understand where we should focus, we started with three variants, our current price, 25% more, and 50% more.As we tracked click throughs and purchase intent, I was shocked to see that 50% more won. So, we re-ran the experiment, 50%, 100%, 150%. Again… the largest price won. So again, 150%, 250%, 300%.The same result, at a period we were testing a 3.5X price increase through the funnel. I ultimately decided on the 2.5X increase for two reasons. First, we had the most complete and conclusive data at that price point, and secondly (and most real) I was scared as the test results kept coming in at larger and larger increases.While letting fear make decisions internally is a bad idea, now with the Consumer Price Index increasing at nearly twice the rate as when we were price testing, I’m definitely glad we didn’t max out in a single move—everyone is hurting more now than they were when we ran our tests.This also brings up the point that this was not a fast process. We spent over a year from start to finish, and just the pricing experiments took over 8 months to get through.Now with lessons learned we could move much more quickly, but this is also a great reason why pricing should be considered on a regular basis—if you wait 8 years to increase your prices, you’re probably going to need at least a year to discover the right price moving forward.After letting new prices run in production for several months it was time for the “easy” part—letting existing customers know that prices would be going up. Increasing prices for existing customers is a touchy subject. I’ve spoken to a number of our customers who feel this way when doing a price increase, and some of them have convinced me that not increasing prices on existing customers is the right thing for them.Generally, it comes down to balancing chaos and upside. For us, given how long we’d gone without an increase and our goals, increasing everyone’s price was worth the chaos. One customer in particular stands out to me, he said “What’s most important to me is maintaining stability.”If anyone says that to me, increasing everyone’s price is definitely not the way to go—I was glad that they decided to test an increase for new customers while leaving their current base alone. (Although we are a customer and I’m pretty sure I saw a price increase come through later, so maybe I changed their mind 😅.)We notified all existing customers of the price increase in March, one month before the increase took effect. My expectation was that when we announced the increase the floodgates were going to open and we’d have thousands of emails, chats, and phone calls with confused, upset, or generally discontent customers.However, what actually happened was that a very small percent of our customers reached out on our first email.This group was definitely the most proactive of the bunch (clearly), and the conversations we had were pretty organized. They saw the change was coming, they wanted to understand exactly what it meant for them, and then they wanted to see what options they had.Some of these customers decided to leave, but very few of them—since they had the chance to talk to us before anything “happened” we were able to put a plan that worked for them in place.The increase took effect in early April. This time, the “second wave” response was immediate:The majority of angry responses came from folks who believed they hadn’t been notified at all. In all of these cases, they were sent the email, but either missed it or didn’t read it. Through both the email announcement and our support team fielding messages from customers, we invited customers to schedule time with me personally if they wanted to discuss the price increase. Over a span of three months, I had about 100 calls with customers. The sentiment of these calls can be broken down into the following categories: People who wanted to yell at me (totally understandable)People who wanted to work out a deal right away People who wanted to better understand what was happening and how it would impact their pricing People who were close to churning anyway and needed to be resold on Baremetrics for reasons including but not limited to the price increase I expected these calls to be mostly of the first category, but reality is that most of these calls were super productive, and if not “good natured” then at least “professional.”One thing that caught me off guard was that we ask for customer feedback all the time… but there’s something special about getting customer feedback through a price increase. It really cuts through all the fluff, it’s not like when you ask for feedback and people say “everything is great!” or “well, this one small change might make the product slightly better for us.”Quite the opposite, we were showing up with a materially higher price, so people cut right to the core of what the product did for them. Customers shared where we excelled, where we were lacking, and what deal breakers existed. The conversation would go something like: “We love Baremetrics and use it every day. It’s crucial for us to slice and dice our data to really understand if experiments are working or not. However, at this higher price we really need to get more out of the product. We would hate to spend the time and money moving these dashboards internally, but if you can’t help me understand how you’re adding to our growth we’ll need to evaluate that option.Or, another very popular conversation would start “Your team has been great to us, but this is way too expensive for a dashboard.” These conversations were great because it gave us a chance to have a deeper conversation—generally I’d say “I agree! If we were just a dashboard I wouldn’t pay that much for it either. If you’re willing I can show you a few ways that our customers who are OK with the new price use Baremetrics to make us worth the money… if you still don’t agree then we can help migrate you to another solution.”Putting aside the specific way we had these conversations, I want to reiterate that these customers felt this way about our product before the price increase. Anyone who was thinking we were “just a dashboard” felt that way before we emailed them, they were (happily) using about 5% of the product and leaving the majority of the value we provide on the table. Clearly, increasing prices can’t be the only way you have this conversation, but if you want to have all of these conversations, all at once, this is a great way to do it.And these conversations had all sorts of interesting twists, for example through the call I was invited to speak on the Bootstrapped.fm podcast with Ed Freyfogle. I appreciated talking with Ed about some of the early feedback we got from customers about the price increase, as well as things not related to the price increase like my transition from founder to non-founder CEO and the unique challenges of taking over somebody else’s business. You can listen to the episode here, or click below. Practically overnight, our MRR increased by over 86%. While this was exciting to see, we knew that this number represented the maximum possible outcome—we had a lot of hard conversations ahead of us and we knew that not everyone was going to be willing to pay the new price. Still, as we were on the verge of crossing $200k MRR, it was great to see the first digit of our MRR at “3”, and it felt right.Since implementing the 2.5X pricing 7 months ago, our user churn rate has fluctuated between 4 and 6.9%. Obviously, you get your normal churn during this period, but increasing prices also creates churn all of its own.In the spirit of naming terrible things somewhat innocuously, I’ve been referring to this as the “price increase double whammy.” The price increase creates excess churn above baseline, and customers are now churning out at a higher level.During the first quarter we looked at user churn instead of revenue churn to level out the second effect, but the impact is persistent and should be expected. For example, a business who has a baseline monthly churn of $10k who increases their price by 100% should expect at least $20k churn per month.This is clear, but you'd be surprised how many people don’t account for this higher baseline of churn in their forecasts. Churn mitigation is always a top priority for SaaS businesses, but, doubling or tripling the value of each customer puts increased importance in making sure each and every one of your customers is satisfied. Moving into Q4 of this year we got to experience the rare “price increase triple whammy” — as the economy has turned for the worse we would have experienced heightened churn even without a price increase.We’re seeing companies getting incredibly lean and preparing for “SaaS winter.” We’re seeing funding rounds slow (or stop all together). We even heard from one of our serial entrepreneur customers that their most recent seed round had more due diligence than the series B of their previous company. The bright side for us is that we can solve these problems for our customers, but again this is a matter of having that value conversation—if a customer makes up their mind that it’s time to leave, then it’s tough to do anything in the moment. I was expecting frustration from our customers, but I simply didn’t anticipate the amount of stress and distraction that the price increase was going to create for everybody on our team. It’s obvious in retrospect (as all things are) that this was going to be a huge investment of time, but it’s slightly different from the perspective that everyone is dealing with what feel like “high stress, high importance” conversations on a regular basis. Every team at Baremetrics is organized around how they can make our customers successful, so this phase has been quite a shake up—historically it’s always been us and our customers against a problem, but in these conversations now we’re on opposite sides of the table. That’s a tough transition for the team to make.It’s also become a persistent conversation, earlier I said that I had anticipated most of the conversations to happen after sending out our price increase email, when in fact the bulk of the conversations happened 2-3 months after pricing had been increased.My only saving grace here is that the entire company was involved and engaged in the price testing, we all understood why it was important to do, and it was clear how we were going to deploy additional money to triple down on our objectives as a team. Without an understanding of the mission I suspect this process would have been much more soul crushing.Also, everyone did a great job of working together and staying mission driven. No one felt like it was solely their responsibility to “make it work”. Everyone was empowered to approach these customer conversations the same way we always do— what can we do to help our customers? Every time you make a big move you learn something new, even if you’ve done it a hundred times before. The number one thing I learned from this process was that being crystal clear and transparent in what we’re doing and why we’re doing is paramount.The most common (and painful) feedback after speaking to hundreds of customers summarized to “it’s not what you did, it’s how you did it.”Here’s what I’d do differently if I had it to do over again:Lead with transparency. In hindsight, the email we sent about the price increase was too long (it took about 5 minutes to read). It became this length because we went into detail about the several reasons why we were increasing prices mentioned above. Send multiple emails across a larger time period, timed in advance of our customers’ next payment. I suspect this came about from our long testing period—we had been in pricing mode for over a year, so it didn’t really feel strange at the time for us to announce the increase in March, effective in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned before that the conversations we had with customers between the announcement and the price change going into effect went really well—this lets the conversation happen in advance of anything changing, which makes the conversation feel different.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re discussing something that’s already happened the customer can feel like there’s not much for them to do, making it way easier for them to throw their hands up and walk away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The easiest way to maximize this opportunity is to maximize the length of time between announcement and implementation. Netflix did this back in the day, giving over a year notice for an upcoming price increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes a ton of sense with our experience, that’s plenty of time to have conversations with all your customers to make sure that works, and if not, you have the time to resolve issues before the price increase takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also true for customers paying annually—any pain a monthly customer feels with the increase is 10x higher for an annual customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We send automated notifications seven days before renewal, but again this is a situation where seven days isn’t enough time for us to resolve issues before the renewal takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started reaching out to customers much further out, starting 90 days out from their renewal date, to get the conversation started. If they saw any issues with renewing at the new price we’ve got three months to resolve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We actually really enjoy having these calls and will keep this follow up pattern going moving forward. It makes sense that the customers paying annually are more committed to your team, so investing more time in making sure they’re satisfied feels great.Include the updated pricing in our communications. This was a huge ball dropped on our side. We didn’t include the updated pricing in our initial email with the rationale being that talking over a call was a more effective way to further explain what was going on, give options, hear feedback from the customer, and ultimately help them migrate from Baremetrics if we couldn’t figure out a way to move forward with the new pricing. While the price increase created a busy many months, we've been fortunate to complete a lot of what we set out to do in the first place. As mentioned previously, the price increase was successful in letting us achieve our primary goal of reorganizing the entire company around our mission to help entrepreneurs succeed. This includes doubling our engineering team to build more quickly, doubling our support and success teams to make it easier for our customers to find growth opportunities (or, to find them for you), and doubling our accounts team to lead onboarding for new customers and customers who haven’t gotten a tour of the product in a while. We’ve also doubled our marketing team since we realized that a big issue is that we make an improvement and then never tell anyone!We also acquired a business and built a team around leveling up cash generation within a company—we’ve seen this as a huge gap in both our product and the market as a whole, but we’re now able to help our customers understand cash flow to both make sure you invest in the right areas, and, make sure your bank balance stays positive despite a challenging economy. It’d be too much to say that we’re a completely different company. I’d say instead that before the price increase we always had to manage our expectations and balance the way we wanted to serve our customers with the reality of our operations. Now, anything that’s brought up internally that will help us meet our mission gets a green light. For all the negatives that a price increase brings, being 1000% in on our mission feels great.You might have also noticed some other activities that we’ve done to improve our transparency:We hosted our first-ever AMA with our customers, during which I talked about the state of Baremetrics before and after the acquisition, the price increase, our roadmap, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a ton of fun. We got some great questions (and some scary ones too,) it was great being in a forum and providing the level of transparency that people expect from us. Surprisingly, this was also a great way to share lessons learned too!We ended our “call to cancel” policy to make the cancellation process more seamless for our customers (you can read more about this decision here)Created new brand principles centered around our customers and their successI hope this serves dually as a price increase roadmap and inspiration. I spoke a lot to the challenges, but, hopefully you’ve made it this far to get to the “we can become the company we’ve always wanted to be” part! It’s important to reiterate that this has been our approach, the best path for your business is specific to the nature of your business and your goals. If you’re considering a price increase for your SaaS, let ’s talk. I’d be happy to dive in deeper about our journey and/or share feedback on what you’re thinking about.

      "Our Most Controversial Business Decision.\n",
      "Requiring a call for customers to cancel their accounts was the most controversial decision we've ever made at Baremetrics.After getting tons of feedback, both from our team here and directly from customers, I decided to end our “call to cancel” policy in October.While we’ve already removed “call to cancel'' from our cancellation flow, I wanted to take a minute to walk down memory lane and review why we started in the first place, what we learned, and what lessons you can implement in your company (without a lot of the pain.)After acquiring Baremetrics, I found myself operating a business with seven years of history and 900 customers. The (somewhat obvious) number one priority was to understand who our customers are, what they do, what they love about us, and perhaps most importantly, what they hate about us, all in the shortest time possible.If we don’t understand our customers and their relationship with the product, how can we possibly make good decisions? This strategy was larger than just requiring a call  to cancel, we reviewed every potential opportunity for a customer interaction and found ways to introduce higher fidelity touchpoints. For example:We decreased response time for chat on our marketing site. People who were previously browsing passively moved to having conversations, asking questions and getting clarification in real-time (instead of getting a response after they’ve moved on.)We introduced product walkthroughs. Previously customers had to reach out to us for help getting their account set up, now we reach out and offer help, and where possible take live calls. Our customers get a better understanding of our product and how they can meet their goals, and we get to learn about the customer, how we can help, and identify gaps.We actively sought opportunities to have calls to review complex support issues with our customers. Previously we’d email back and forth as long as it took, but with the shift in mindset we could both resolve issues more quickly while also learning more about our customers’ goals.And, yes, requiring customers to talk to us when they cancel their account. While all of the other touch points were optional (although we did consider mandatory onboarding calls,) requiring a call to cancel an account was mandatory for two reasons.Frankly, we didn’t think enough customers would opt in if it was optional. Understanding why customers are canceling is mission #1 when trying to understand your company and where you have to improve. It was obvious that customers would be upset (or furious, I once had someone pull up my linkedin so he could roast my professional history on the call 😅,) but we made the call that the amount of friction it created was worth it for the insights we could get.Secondly, it gave us a moment to help the customer off the platform. It was really common for customers to continue to send us data after they left, or lose access to data sent to Baremetrics along the way. So, in addition to helping ourselves (which was definitely the primary goal) we got to provide a service, too. Surprisingly to me, something like 60% of the people appreciated the offboarding and provided in-depth feedback (up to 45 mins to an hour!), 20% of the people just wanted to get through it as quickly as possible (single word answers), and the remaining 20% probably would have rather had a cage match.Historically, we had been relying on our own product, Cancellation Insights, to both collect and analyze this churn data.In regards to the first point, Baremetrics users might be wondering why we wouldn’t just use our Cancellation Insights tool. Why make our success team take calls when we have a tool that collects the same information? As a quick plug, Cancellation Insights rules. It’s one of our products that automatically presents cancellation surveys to churning customers in app, or sends the survey via email (your choice.) The cool thing is that using Cancellation Insights allows you to have churn conversations around revenue lost, and not just customers. It’s really common that smaller customers churn for different reasons than larger customers, and it’s just as common to have recency bias when planning out your roadmap—Cancellation Insights let’s you see the actual revenue impact on your business as you’re planning to either build a feature a competitor has but your missing versus fixing a bug in one of your current features.Because this is in your Baremetrics account everything is tied back to a customer’s profile, so you can review the entire journey: sign up, plan changes, charges, through to discounts, previous churn, and finally their cancellation reason. Cancellation Insights has been huge for getting the whole picture around churn.So after that pitch… Why didn’t we use it?The somewhat evasive answer is that we did—we just had our team in front entering the data. Coming in fresh to the business, I didn’t even have confidence that the churn reasons in our Cancellation Insights matched our business… which is ultimately what led to making the calls synchronous.When we started doing this, I took 100% of the calls. If the customer was willing to share their story with Baremetrics, I’d ask about what we did great, and where we dropped the ball. If they had any questions I made sure they were answered, and I took the lead on getting any data out of the platform they wanted to bring with them. I’d take copious notes through the process, and as I had a series of cancellations I would review them to see what themes exist, adding new categories where it made sense, and then putting multiple paragraphs into the “anything you want to share?” field so we could always refer back later.This definitely rubbed some people the wrong way, but we actually found later that Baremetrics’ founder, Josh Pigford, actually removed self-serve cancellation in 2017 (great minds think alike?) You should read this great post for yourself, but he made this decision when Baremetrics’ churn had risen from 6 percent to an unsustainable 13 percent. By removing self-serve cancellation, he and his team were able to collect actionable feedback and save around 15% of the customers who tried to cancel.I’m sharing a bit here on the why and how to hopefully demystify the process a bit, and perhaps to dispel some notions that it’s unethical or evil. I’ll completely concede that it’s the high conflict path to take, and it's extraordinarily annoying to (at least 40% of) your customers, but it has a time and a place, and can reveal a ton about what’s not working in your business. The formula for evaluating the continuation of call to cancel was something like (novel insights gained / customer frustration) > 1. When we first started talking to customers, it felt like 100% new information. Customer frustration was at an extremely high 100, but, our insights were like 10,000, so while painful, it still made sense to keep going.But, over time, novel insights gained has gone down. Since starting, we’ve gone from not knowing why customers were canceling to having a prioritized list of issues for us to go after and having repeated conversations. Initially every conversation was novel, but eventually we realized: after the first minute we knew exactly what the customer was thinking, which problems were affecting them, and what solutions we could have implemented to save them.The straw that broke the camel's back was a customer survey we did a bit prior to making the decision. We sent out a survey using this tool called Voiceform, which let’s customers either type answers, or, they can speak instead. We heard otherwise happy customers remark that they didn’t agree with the practice, and that it generally created friction against our mission to help entrepreneurs succeed. Hearing that in the voice of the customer brought us back to our formula… and we were under water. Novel insights had gone down, but customer frustration was as high as ever—to the point that it was no longer a good deal for anyone.At this point, causing frustration wasn’t worth it anymore. So, we officially reinstated self-serve cancellation on October 29th, 2022. Now, if a customer wants to cancel their Baremetrics subscription, they can do so directly from their account. They’ll be prompted to share a reason for canceling via Cancellation Insights.If you’ve made it this far in the blog post perhaps you’re dealing with churn that you’re not quite sure how to handle, and are perhaps thinking of requiring customers to talk to you in order to leave. I hope that what I’ve shared here makes you feel a bit more confident in giving that a try as an experiment.If you’re still not quite sure what to do, reach out to me and I’ll be happy to review your business and provide some specific recommendations as someone who’s been through it!

      "A Beginner’s Guide to Annual Budgeting.\n",
      "As the saying goes, ‘If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail’. This sums up the importance of an annual budget. The goal of annual budgeting is to give you the tools you need to make operational decisions about your company, and answer questions like: In this article, we’ll discuss the most important reasons why your team should be creating an annual budget, the difference between planning, budgeting, and forecasting, as well as three annual budgeting techniques beginners can use to get started. An annual budget projects income and expenses, assets and liabilities, and cash position for an organization, generally for a 12-month period. Annual budgets are also known as an operating plan, annual operating plan or financial operating plan. Annual budgets, as the name suggests, are prepared once a year, either for a calendar year or a fiscal year (if the fiscal year is different than the calendar year). Monitoring the variance between the annual budget/operating plan and actual business performance provides insights into the business environment and the complete financial wellbeing of the company.Generally, financial planning and analysis (FP&A) is the team within a company’s finance function that drives the entire budgeting process. The subscription business model is different from other models in that customers must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. These can be weekly, monthly, or annual payments.One of the key aspects of building a successful subscription business is not just to attract customers, but to attract loyal subscribers who are likely to maintain their subscription for a long period. When creating an annual budget for your SaaS or subscription business, keep the following factors in mind: A company’s long-term vision, or mission statement, communicates its values as an organization. These values then develop into goals and strategies that are the foundation of the budgets being drafted. As an example, here’s our long-term vision at Baremetrics: Our purpose is to help SaaS entrepreneurs achieve their purpose, grow their businesses and thrive. We will be the champion for SaaS companies globally, drive innovation and provide the best customer service possible. Our customers will see us as an invaluable partner and not a tool.  To make this happen we design and build the best products in the world to uncover insights, solve and automate the common business problems faced by our customers.Based on our vision, we budgeted accordingly for the following actions in the latter half of 2022: You need to have plans in place to react to these different scenarios so that the entire organization aims for the best but is prepared for the worst. After all, part of being an agile company means anticipating market forces before they happen and having a plan in place to dodge potential issues while taking advantage of new opportunities. Having a budget helps in quantifying these plans.Planning, budgeting and forecasting are all significant drivers in growing sustainably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning gets things started and continues throughout the life of the business. Budgeting works at a more granular level and projects the next 12 months. Forecasting estimates a company's future financial projections in advance and in a way supports the planning. There are various methods of creating budgets but the most used by beginners are:Incremental budgetingZero based budgeting with a bottoms-up approachTop-down approachIncremental budgeting is a method in which next year’s budget is prepared by building on to last year’s actuals after adjusting for inflation and other incremental factorsIt is quick to do and a relatively simple process. With Forecasting+ the information is readily available and can be auto pulled from your accounting software (Xero or QuickBooks), so very limited quantitative analysis is needed.It is appropriate in stable circumstances. For example, the amount of office expenses spent in one year is unlikely to be significantly different in the next year, so taking the actual spend in year one and adding a little for inflation should be a reasonable target for the spend in the next year.Building a comprehensive, operationally focused budget requires a lot of work to set up, but the benefits are critical to grow your business. That’s why growing SaaS and subscription businesses trust Forecasting+ by Baremetrics. Forecasting+ integrates with QBO and Xero to automatically bring in your actuals every month. Then, with your updated data, create the budgets, models, scenarios, and other dashboards you need in a few clicks.

      "Best Practices For Onboarding SaaS Customers.\n",
      "Simply put, customers are driven by value. This means that if they find a different product that’s faster, cheaper, or easier to use than yours, there’s a good chance they’ll churn. One way to ensure customers get value from your product right away is by creating an onboarding experience that sets them up to achieve what they’re trying to achieve with your product. In this post, we’ll talk about why customer onboarding is so important for SaaS companies, and cover some best practices for engaging and educating new customers about your product.Customer onboarding is the process of getting your customers up-to-speed with using your product. This means helping customers solve the problem that initially led them to your product and motivated them to sign up for a trial or paid subscription. Some elements of a customer onboarding process include welcome emails, product tours, access to a knowledge base, and more.SaaS and subscription businesses need to carefully implement their onboarding process because customers will not continue paying for a product if they don’t know how to use it effectively. Beyond building customer loyalty, an effective onboarding experience can improve customer engagement, increase trial conversions, and lead to other positive business outcomes.A great customer onboarding process goes beyond demonstrating how to use certain features by actually showing customers how to maximize their experience. Rather than overwhelming them with details about everything your product is capable of, you should help them accomplish what they set out to do. This can turn customers into habitual users that increase your average customer lifetime value. Now that we’ve discussed how important customer onboarding is to the long-term success of SaaS businesses, here are a few best practices to consider.The signup process is the first step in customer onboarding, and a great opportunity to get started the right way. This means making it easy for customers to sign up for a free trial. Although it may depend on your ARPU (i.e. do you serve larger companies and therefore need to have a more thorough sales process?) reducing friction as much as possible is your best bet. Let’s look at MetricFire as an example. They offer a free, 14-day trial that includes access to all of their open source monitoring tools. They don’t require a credit card upon signing up either. Instead, they ask for payment when the trial ends. Immediately after signup, you’ll also want to send an onboarding welcome email that encourages customers to complete an action within the product and provides a few resources to answer any questions they might have. These simple steps will give your customers a “quick win” and help you make sure your customers understand how to use your product from the start.Another important way to improve customer onboarding is getting customers to engage with your product. This requires understanding how users are interacting with it. To do this, track product usage and specifically look at how new customers are engaging with your product during their first week. What features are they using the most? Are there trends in the product-related questions they are asking? These kinds of insights help you identify points of friction.You can also monitor the performance of your trials.  Tracking trial insights and metrics like trial-to-paid conversion rate, average trial length, new trials, and other metrics can indicate larger trends that might be affecting your conversion rate. Perhaps you’re bringing in the wrong kinds of leads, or a different time-frame for your trial would be more successful. You can get these stats in Baremetrics under the Trial Insights tool. Like other Baremetrics dashboards, Trial Insights allows you to segment your trial information by different attributes and compared different time frames.Customers will likely have questions when they first begin using your product. A good onboarding experience ensures customers know where to get help when they need it.A few ways to offer help to customers include:Building a knowledge base with content about the most frequently asked questionsOffering product demos, andProviding a comprehensive getting started guideThese educational resources could mean the difference between a user churning early on because they can’t find the answer to a question or becoming a valuable long-term customer.While tracking product usage and customer satisfaction is great for understanding how well your onboarding process is performing, qualitative customer feedback can help you know why. For example, you can look for trends when customers cancel, such as not understanding how to use your product, not seeing the value in it, or other issues related to onboarding.To gather feedback, you can send out a survey by email or within your app when a customer wants to cancel their subscription. These cancellation insights can help you identify poor customer experiences related to onboarding, and even reveal much larger issues about your product and brand. This allows you to continuously improve your onboarding process to increase customer engagement and reduce churn.While onboarding emails can be effective, it’s important not to go overboard. One of the most important ways to implement a good onboarding process is to avoid overwhelming customers at the start. Instead, you want to provide the most essential information they need to use your product, and then point them to resources where they can get more help themselves later on. Customers might have questions as they get started, but if you implement all the previous best practices and then give customers space, they can become more involved with your product at their own pace. Getting out of the way is a much better approach to increasing customer engagement than trying to force it with too many low-value interactions.SaaS and subscription companies need to make sure their customers understand how to use their product and recognize its value early on if they want to increase customer retention and customer lifetime value. More importantly, delivering a great customer experience requires constant improvements over time. Along with implementing the best practices outlined above, SaaS companies should consistently analyze their customer onboarding performance using real time insights. This data-driven approach to customer experience management can lead to a much more effective onboarding journey.Baremetrics is a metrics, dunning, and engagement platform that tracks trial conversions, churn rate, retention rate, and dozens of other KPIs for SaaS and subscription companies.This can help you optimize your customer onboarding process — and other aspects of your customer experience — to achieve better business growth. \n"

      "5 Customer Retention Strategies That Actually Work.\n",
      "For SaaS and subscription companies, metrics like customer retention rate — and the closely related churn rate — are critical for monitoring the amount of revenue you’re losing, as well as flagging trends that might be responsible for it. And the reality is that increasing customer retention and reducing churn is the key to sustainable business growth.In this post, we’ll discuss five  customer retention strategies that help you keep customers around for longer, and give tips for accurately tracking customer retention and churn for your SaaS business. Customer retention is a metric that tracks the percentage of customers that stay with a business for a certain period of time. The opposite of this is the churn rate, which is the percentage of customers that end their subscription in a given time period. Both of these metrics significantly impact monthly recurring revenue (MRR), arguably the most important indicator of future business success.A good monthly customer retention rate is generally above 90%, but the closer to 100% the better. It’s obviously impossible to retain every single customer, but if your retention rate is extremely low you know your business has a problem. These live benchmarks can help you understand where your customer retention rate (and other metrics) stand compared to similar SaaS and subscription businesses.The success of most SaaS and Subscription businesses depends on their ability to keep customers paying them for a long time. For most companies, it costs more to acquire new customers than it does to keep existing ones, so it’s a more sustainable growth strategy to invest in customer retention. That’s why it’s important to conduct customer retention analysis, and then implement strategies for improving retention over time.Now that we’ve covered how customer retention impacts SaaS and subscription businesses, let’s look at some strategies for improving this metric.The quality of customer support your business provides can make or break a customer experience. Customers want to know that you’ll be able to help them overcome any issues they have, whether it’s a product bug, failed payment, or another problem. Effective customer support includes answering customer inquiries quickly, helping with onboarding (more on this later), and troubleshooting any problems in a timely manner.In addition to providing reactive customer support, investing in proactive outreach can make a meaningful difference, too. By regularly checking in with customers – even if they’re not looking to leave – you can create more opportunities for engagement and value from your product. Here’s an example from our team: Our team sent an email to a customer who hadn’t logged into their Baremetrics account for 2 weeks. This prompted them to log into their account and pick up where they left off. The customer onboarding process is another key aspect of your customer experience, so getting this right ensures you don’t lose customers early on in their subscription. A great onboarding experience involves showing customers how to effectively use your product to achieve what they’re trying to accomplish. If customers don’t  get enough value out of your product, they won’t stick around for long. Through strong education resources and training programs, you can help customers maximize their ROI for your product more quickly. Getting started guides can help answer many initial questions, but a help center is also a great way for customers to resolve additional issues that might come up.Over the years, Baremetrics has built a process for creating and updating content in our help docs to ensure the information is relevant and useful. For example, for our Recover feature, we cover everything from how to interpret the information Recover collects, how to set up your account, how to update specific aspects , and more. Similar to creating a strong onboarding experience, you also want to offer resources and build community around your product. Resources like workshops and webinars give customers even more value from their subscription, and in turn, increase their incentive to stay long-term.By understanding which customers are leaving and why, you informed strategy to get them to stay. For example, tracking and measuring churn for different customer segments and performing cohort analysis can help you spot reasons that some customers might churn over others. Based on this information, you can alleviate mismatches in customer expectations, poor onboarding experiences, bad acquisition strategies, and other broader business issues.Getting customers to share their feedback is a great way to discover issues with your product or customer interactions that are pushing customers to cancel. To take this a step further, collecting cancellation insights and actioning them helps you mitigate disloyalty and improve customer retention in a lasting way. A convenient way to gather feedback is a timely email or in-app notification when customers decide to cancel their subscription. With cancellation insights, you’ll be able to identify and overcome pricing issues, lack of certain features, poor support, or any other factors that are contributing to customer churn. Another crucial aspect of increasing customer retention and reducing churn is accurately calculating these metrics. Here’s how to calculate retention rate and churn:Retaining customers is the difference between business stagnation and growth. If you can implement some of these strategies for increasing customer retention, you’ll be able to build a loyal customer base that drives subscription revenue long term.Baremetrics is a metrics, dunning, and engagement platform that can automatically calculate retention rate, churn, and dozens of other KPIs for you.

      "For those of you playing from home you will recall my previous post on the fees in B2B transactions that nobody is talking about.Well, as it turns out…people are starting to talk about them, and as the blog suggests the whole concept of what is best practice when it comes to B2B transactions is coming under scrutiny. So it begs the question: While the incumbent giants PayPal and Stripe seem to excel in invoicing and billing, are they the best solution to handle transactions? We at Baremetrics are lucky enough to have a collaborative and supportive customer base, with whom we’ve been experimenting on better ways to handle transactions that result in a win-win outcome.One process we’ve been experimenting with is through leveraging our mutual relationship with a fintech platform called Mercury to handle transactions directly, and therefore less expensively. Packagecloud is an enterprise-grade software package management solution that offers a unified, developer friendly interface for all of your artifacts written in any language, delivered to any infrastructure. Packagecloud has been a valued Baremetrics customer since 2015, taking full advantage of the Baremetrics toolkit including Metrics, Recover and Cancellation Insights. Like Baremetrics,Packagecloud is a Mercury customer. This presented an opportunity to trial a new and unique way for Packagecloud  to pay for their Baremetrics subscription. For those unfamiliar with Mercury, Mercury is  a fintech platform geared towards supporting startups and offers an API for every account. The provision of an API essentially turns Mercury into a headless banking platform that unlocks any number of automations and customisations.By utilizing these automations we were able to write a small snippet of code that seamlessly allows Packagecloud to set up an automated payment to Baremetrics via their respective Mercury accounts. While at first it may just look like a standard ACH transfer, the ability to subsequently automate this transaction and offer it as a checkout payment option opens up a world of opportunity to effectively subvert unnecessary fees.In utilizing an automated transfer to Mercury, we can immediately reduce COGS associated with credit card transactions and pass the savings on to our customers who choose to use this payment method. We are still ironing out kinks with how we reconcile the payment ID against an invoice, and how to detect fraud, but we are excited to continue to work towards giving our customers a more efficient way to pay for their  Baremetrics subscription.Like with everything we do, Baremetrics exists to help founders, entrepreneurs and product pioneers achieve their purpose. We can do this by helping them “make more” in every facet of their business: Make more informed marketing decisions through deep customer insights, make more prudent decisions when forecasting upcoming expenses, and overall make more revenue by utilizing rich, user-friendly dashboards that detail the very lifeblood of your business.Book some time with our revenue experts today to find out how we can help you make more and achieve the very purpose you have set out to achieve.\n"

      "Dunning Solutions for Enterprise Companies.\n",
      "When a company grows past 1000 employees (in other words, an \"enterprise\"-sized company), it becomes much harder to manage customer subscriptions, billing, and other essential business operations. One area often overlooked by enterprises with a subscription model is putting a process in place for failed customer payments.Our data suggests SaaS and subscription companies are losing around 9% of recurring revenue to failed payments. At the enterprise level, that's a huge amount of lost revenue. That’s why large SaaS and subscription businesses should view a formalized (and automated) customer communication process as a crucial aspect of their payment collections strategy.Read on to learn more about the benefits of dunning solutions for enterprise organizations and how Baremetrics can automate your dunning process and recover hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue.A dunning solution is an automated payment recovery tool. The name comes from the term dun, which means to persistently demand payment for debt. That’s likely why dunning processes have gotten a bad reputation over the years — but today’s dunning solutions have come a long way.An effective dunning solution can provide a much more positive experience for customers than simply demanding payments. Through automated email campaigns, in-app notifications, and paywalls, a dunning solution helps you work with customers to resolve payment issues in a way that can even build a stronger relationship.If you’re still not convinced that your enterprise should be using a dunning solution, here are five major benefits to consider.Recurring revenue loss is one of the greatest challenges for enterprises with a subscription or SaaS business model. Many enterprises focus more on increasing MRR, but small amounts of lost revenue can also compound over time and significantly limit business growth.The reality is that failed payments only become lost revenue if you do nothing about them, yet many enterprises lack an adequate payment recovery process. This means companies are choosing to ignore unnecessary recurring revenue loss that’s hurting their subscription-based business. Subscriptions are meant to be seamless, but it’s inevitable for payments to go wrong for some customers. That’s why it’s so important to have a way to quickly and easily resolve payment issues. By automating the dunning process, you can recover lost revenue and prevent a loss of MRR to continue growing your subscription business.Besides MRR, customer churn rate is one of the most important metrics for SaaS and subscription businesses. Churn occurs when a subscription is canceled, downgraded, pauses, or canceled.While some customer churn may be the result of a poor customer experience or product issues, there are many situations where churn isn’t a deliberate choice by customers. For example, a failed payment that goes unresolved for too long may prevent an otherwise satisfied customer’s subscription from renewing. Small issues like incorrect credit card information or an expired card can easily prevent you from collecting a recurring payment — and the customer may not even realize there was a problem. This form of involuntary churn can eat away at your enterprise if you’re not proactively resolving customer payment issues.A dunning solution can help you reduce involuntary or passive churn through dunning emails and in-app reminders. This gives customers the opportunity to update their payment information to avoid a disruption to their subscription.It can be challenging for large businesses to effectively scale customer interactions, but this is an essential part of retaining customers. In fact, adding more customer touchpoints through automation can help you engage with customers more frequently, leading to stronger relationships over time.An effective dunning solution can go far beyond helping your recover payments by promoting a positive customer experience. The key is sending helpful emails rather than overwhelming your customers with generic emails that they’ll just ignore. Customized dunning emails with a human touch can help you show your customers that you are willing to work with them to resolve any issues and that you value their business. High-quality engagement with your customers can encourage more loyalty for your brand. The first post-sales interaction should not be a generic failed payment message. Instead, you should put in place a dunning process that helps proactively resolve a potential payment issue well before you reach that point. This can improve the customer experience and cultivate loyal customers that are more likely to recommend your product or service to others.Customer services teams have limited resources to handle customer inquiries about product bugs, account problems, and more. That means customer service teams have little time to spend sending out dunning emails or resolving payment issues manually — things that can be more easily automated.Instead, an automated dunning process can help resolve a large number of these payment issues, freeing up your customer service teams to provide higher-value support for other areas of the business. This can improve your enterprise’s overall customer experience because your customer service representatives will be able to focus on more complex inquiries that require human intervention to solve.A dunning solution can also improve your customer experience because you're creating a layer of protection that prevents subscription disruptions. This eliminates the need for customers to contact your customer support to resolve subscription issues in the first place. Any time you can avoid service interruptions you’re creating a better customer experience that can help your business retain loyal customers.Through real-time visibility into customers and revenue, Baremetrics helps enterprises make better data-driven decisions. You’ll have the insights you need to improve operations and grow your business.Baremetrics also provides an automated dunning feature called Recover. This dunning management solution helps you ensure your customer experience is seamless— even when payment issues inevitably arise. Custom dunning email campaigns and in-app notifications will keep your customers in the loop to help prevent involuntary churn and recurring revenue loss.You can use dozens of out-of-the-box integrations to set up an automated dunning process with popular payment processing and subscription management platforms. This makes getting started with automating your dunning process even easier. Just enable the Recover add-on in your Baremetrics dashboard.Most importantly, Recover is also integrated with the data tracking capabilities of the Baremetrics platform. This helps you get a better understanding of why payments are failing, whether your dunning campaigns are working, and other key insights related to dunning management.Set up Recover in 5 minutes and immediately begin recovering revenue and reducing churn.

      "Dunning Solutions For Startups.\n",
      "Every startup with a subscription model knows that recurring payments and subscription-based billing are extremely convenient. After all, you have predictable revenue coming in every month from a customer once you get past that initial sale. But what do you do when a credit card payment inevitably fails for a customer? The reality is that many startups don’t have a process in place to recover revenue lost to failed credit card payments. In fact, our data suggests that SaaS and subscription businesses lose around 9% of their recurring revenue to payment issues, on average. Luckily, there are automated solutions that can not only recoup these losses, but improve other key business metrics as well.In this post, we’ll talk about what dunning processes and solutions are, why startups should use a dunning solution, and how Baremetrics automates the dunning process.Dunning solutions are payment recovery software that use automation to communicate with customers and collect payments. These solutions help you implement an automated dunning process — which is the way you recover failed payments from your customers. When a payment fails you have two options: lose out on revenue by doing nothing or follow up to recover the payment. And if you don’t have a dunning process in place, you’ve chosen the first option by default. Here’s a visual of what a dunning process usually looks like in SaaS:The original meaning of the term \"dun\" meant to demand payment for a debt, but a dunning process can be much more nuanced than spamming customers like a debt collector to recover revenue.  An effective dunning process can proactively resolve potential payment issues, reduce unnecessary subscription cancellations, and even improve customer engagement. Building a positive dunning experience for customers requires sending useful and friendly reminders to help them make timely payments. However, it’s hard to manually send out dunning emails to customers as your business grows.Dunning solutions for startups automate the revenue recovery process with email campaigns and in-app notifications. This ensures your startup gets paid faster so that you have the cash flow necessary to scale.The right dunning solution proactively resolves payment issues and therefore can help your startup run more smoothly. Here’s four examples. Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is the most important metric for SaaS and subscription businesses. It allows you to measure and predict revenue using a single, consistent number. This helps you track the growth of your subscription-based revenue startup over time.An effective dunning solution can help you prevent a loss of MRR. This may not be glamorous, but it’s already hard enough for many startups to grow MRR — and it’s even harder when you’re losing revenue due to failed payments at the same time. You’ve already made the sale, so why would you let that revenue go without doing anything about it?Churn — when a subscription is canceled, downgraded, paused, or delinquent — is often the biggest roadblock for growing MRR. Although  churn is usually a deliberate choice by customers, there are also many cases where churn is involuntary. For example, when a failed payment goes unresolved long enough that the customer’s subscription is not renewed.It may seem obvious, but it often costs startups much more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing ones. That means reducing involuntary churn is a crucial way to grow MRR over the long term. The problem is that many startups put too little effort into preventing involuntary churn.Some of the most common causes of involuntary churn are simple credit card issues – like incorrect card details or an expired card – that prevent you from collecting a payment. Since customers may not even know their payment has failed, reminding them to update their payment information could be the difference between keeping a satisfied customer or losing one due to neglect. An automated dunning solution is the best defense against involuntary churn. Timely payment reminders, in-app notifications, and paywalls can all help you ensure your customers are aware of potential payment issues that would impact their subscription.Consistent recurring revenue comes from customers that are happy with your product and service. An effective dunning process is an opportunity to engage with your customers in a way that contributes to their overall positive customer experience. The right dunning solution can transform an annoying request like asking someone to update their credit card into a positive customer touchpoint that shows your business values them as a customer. How to do this? Communicate with your customers in the same way you did when you initially won them over as a customer. The key points here are sounding like a human and adding some customization to your emails. Sounding like a human might sound obvious, but you’d be surprised at how many SaaS companies talk to their customers like robots.And as far as customization goes… by addressing the recipient by their name in the email, click-through-rate can be increased up to 35%. By putting some effort into your dunning email campaigns, you can build stronger customer relationships and recover lost revenue at the same time.As we discussed with involuntary churn, many customers who have failed payments actually want to continue with their subscription. That means any disruption to their service due to a failed payment can quickly turn them from a satisfied customer to a dissatisfied one. To avoid this, you need to notify customers as soon as there could be a potential issue.Dunning solutions provide in-app notifications about outdated payment information or other issues to help customers avoid failed payments and involuntary churn. In-app paywalls can also encourage customers to update their payment information so that they don’t risk losing access to your product. Baremetrics gives SaaS and subscription companies real-time visibility into their revenue and customers. Your startup will be able to track key metrics like MRR and churn to make better decisions to scale your business.More importantly, Baremetrics’ Recover feature is a one-stop shop for automated dunning management. You can set up custom dunning email campaigns and in-app notifications reminding customers to update their payment information or fix other payment issues. Automated email drip campaigns are pre-loaded within Recover to help you quickly get started.If you’re already using Baremetrics, great! Your account is already set up with your payment processor, so once you enable Recover you can immediately begin recovering revenue and reducing churn.Unlike other dunning solutions for startups, Recover is also integrated with the rest of the Baremetrics platform's data tracking capabilities. This enables you to dig deeper into the most common reasons for failed payments, how dunning emails are performing, and a timeline of individual customer dunning experiences.The best part? On average, Recover pays for itself 38x over. After a one-time setup, your startup can begin automatically recovering revenue and reducing churn to grow your business.

      "How to Reduce Churn for Large Companies.\n",
      "While churn is a natural thing for any SaaS or subscription business, it can be hard for large companies to know where it's coming from. That’s because most large companies have many different teams, complex products, a variety of subscription options, and just more customers to deal with in general. These can all be contributing factors to customer churn and lost recurring revenue — both of which hold back business growth in the long run. The good news? There are a number of ways for large companies to identify and reduce churn. Read on to learn more about reducing churn and building loyal customers at larger SaaS or subscription businesses.For subscription-based companies, churn means a customer subscription has ended — either voluntarily or involuntarily. Customers may have a reason for ending their subscription (as we’ll discuss later) or they might simply have a failed payment that is left unresolved too long. Either way, customer churn negatively impacts arguably the most important metrics for subscription businesses: monthly recurring revenue (MRR). The problem is that it’s hard to keep growing MRR if there’s a constant outflow of customers taking potential revenue with them. That means if your SaaS business has more than a 5-7% monthly churn rate — which is generally considered a “healthy” amount — you’ll want to work to improve it.While many large companies have grown by focusing on acquiring new customers, there comes a point where steadily losing recurring revenue from churn cannot be ignored. In fact, when growth halts and MRR takes a hit, it’s easy to assume there are issues with marketing or sales when the problem is really related to churn. An obvious red flag, therefore, is when churn begins to outpace new customers.More importantly, churn can indicate there is an underlying problem that will only continue to get worse as the company grows larger. Involuntary churn suggests payment issues aren’t being resolved in a timely manner. Meanwhile, voluntary churn means there are potential issues with pricing, subscription options, the customer experience, or the product itself. A downward trend in customer lifetime value (LTV) is an obvious sign that there are underlying problems developing as your business grows.These are just a few ways churn impacts large companies, but nearly every SaaS or subscription business should work to reduce churn. While a small amount of churn is inevitable, there’s no reason to endure a high churn rate over the long term. Here are a few reasons many large SaaS companies experience customer churn.Everyone wants to receive the best product or service for the least amount of money, so subscription pricing will always be a deciding factor for some customers. The problem is that large companies have more overhead than startups, which means they often have to charge more to remain profitable. Over time, this can lead to an increase in customer churn if there aren’t subscription options (and prices) that appeal to different customer segments.Depending on the industry and subscription offerings, seasonality can be an issue for large SaaS companies. While a startup can more easily adapt to churn during slower seasons, a larger company has more overhead and employees to support throughout the downturn. This makes it harder to “weather the storm” during low season for large SaaS companies.As a SaaS company grows, its product often becomes more complicated over time. Each new feature can introduce technical issues that customers don’t want to deal with. Larger companies can also have slower development cycles than startups, so they might not be able to fix product issues fast enough to retain a dissatisfied customer.Large companies have more customers (and often more product issues), so there are inevitably more customer service inquiries as well. The problem is that it’s hard to scale customer service to resolve a large volume of issues, forcing many large companies to turn to automated solutions. But today’s consumers expect personalized interactions with a human element — and they might churn if that’s not the customer service experience they receive.While the previous four reasons for customer churn were voluntary, many large companies also experience involuntary churn if they’re not proactively resolving failed payments. Failed payments are inevitable, but they only lead to churn if companies don’t have an effective dunning process in place to help their customers fix payment issues.As you can see, there are a number of reasons for churn at large companies, and it can have a substantial impact on MRR. Here are some ways to reduce churn.Large companies have a lot of customer data they can analyze for buying patterns and churning trends. These customer insights can help SaaS companies determine which features customers are using to create more enticing subscription options for different customers segments. More importantly, customer behavior data can help with setting pricing tiers that optimize profitability and retention for a large customer base. Focusing on the most profitable customers is a smarter way to reduce churn than trying to completely eliminate customer cancellations.Seasonality is inevitable for some industries, but it doesn’t have to lead to churn. One way to overcome seasonality is to encourage customers to choose annual subscriptions, preventing a spike in churn during part of the year. Another approach is to try to turn churns into downgrades with a cheaper subscription option. Customer behavior data can help large companies determine the right approach to overcome seasonality for their business and ensure they’re bringing in recurring revenue year round.There are a number of ways to obtain customer feedback from in-app feedback questionnaires to cancellation surveys by email. This customer feedback can help you identify whether there are product issues that are causing churn, whether it’s technical issues or a lack of certain features that a competitor product already offers. By discovering the most pressing product issues, large companies can prioritize their efforts to improve the overall customer experience.Automation can help scale customer service, but it also needs to be highly personalized to reduce customer churn. In fact, 59% of customers value personalization over speed when it comes to customer service. Using in-depth customer profiles and segmentation data, SaaS companies can create highly personalized automated email campaigns to increase free trial conversions, promote subscription upgrades, prevent cancellations, and more.Failed payments only become lost revenue if companies don’t do anything to resolve them. By putting a revenue recovery process in place, large companies can immediately improve their MRR by reducing involuntary churn. For example, an effective revenue recovery solution can automatically resolve customer payment issues using custom email campaigns that improve customer relationships at the same time.Baremetrics is a metrics, dunning, and engagement tool built for SaaS and subscription businesses. The platform offers a number of features that can help large companies reduce customer churn:Customer Segmentation allows you to organize your data by segments based on geographic location, plan tier, and many other factors. Using these customer segment insights, you'll be able to set subscription tiers that make sense for your different types of customers to reduce churn due to pricing issues. This is also helpful for comparing the profitability of different segments to determine where to focus your customer retention efforts.For example, you can quickly discover if a large number of customers are experiencing product issues that’s causing them to churn. This helps you understand what areas of your customer experience need to improve. You can also optimize your retention efforts by targeting the most profitable customers and send personalized emails to potentially win them back. Baremetrics is a game-changer for large SaaS companies. Besides these features, our platform also offers forecasting, benchmarking, and other tools to propel your subscription-based business forward.Sign up for a free trial to start reducing customer churn with Baremetrics today.\n"

      "How To Reduce Churn For Startups.\n",
      "For the past two months, we’ve asked new Baremetrics customers (primarily small to medium sized SaaS and subscription businesses) what their number one motivation for signing up for Baremetrics was. The options include: The winning motivation, with over 17 percent of responses, was “I want to lower churn.”Are you surprised? Churn is a concern for all SaaS companies, especially startups. And if you aren’t concerned about it, well, you might not be tracking it correctly. So, what does churn look like for startups and how can you lower it? Let’s find out! Churn refers to the number of customers or subscribers who stop using your service during a given period.While some churn is to be expected (a churn rate between 5 to 7 percent is generally considered acceptable in SaaS), founders should always monitor their churn and work towards keeping it as low as possible. But, why would customers decide to ditch you in the first place? Let's look at some of the most common reasons for customer churn below.When your startup is getting off the ground, it’s easy to fall into the trap of wanting to sell to anybody and everybody who’s willing to sign up. This is problematic because your product or service cannot realistically be the best solution for customers of different sizes, industries, business models… the list goes on. Rather, the more granular you can get in identifying your ideal customers (the ones who can be the most successful with your product), the better service you can provide. Customers depend on your product to help them run their businesses. Therefore, any bugs, kinks, or downtime costs them money and productivity.While not every technical problem can be resolved, how your team responds to product issues when they happen can be the difference between keeping a customer and losing them. Do your customers feel heard when they run into a problem? Are you acknowledging how the issue is impacting their ability to do business? Do you have the manpower to keep them in the loop as your team works on finding a solution?Nobody likes to be left in the dark — especially when they’re a customer paying you money.How much you charge your customers needs to align with the value they feel they’re getting from your product. If they feel like they’re paying too much for what they’re getting, there’s a good chance they’ll look elsewhere to your competitors.Speaking of competitors, as a SaaS company, you likely have at least two to three competitors offering a solution that’s similar to yours. If a customer leaves you for a competitor, it’s probably because the other product is cheaper, faster, or easier to use.  Allow us to state the obvious: Canceled customers means less monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for your business. If the MRR you lose from canceled customers becomes greater than MRR from new customers, something is definitely wrong. In fact, higher churn than growth is one of the leading reasons why SaaS startups fail. Along the same vein, if you decide to seek outside investment, potential investors will certainly look at your churn rate when evaluating your company. A low churn rate may indicate potential for long-term success because it means your company requires less capital to maintain your current and likely, future, revenue. A high churn rate, on the other hand, can signal that a product may be a poor market fit, have limited demand, or struggle to compete against similar products.Simply put, too much churn is the antithesis of growth. Once you’ve collected enough responses to analyze trends, try to find out how much revenue each different reason is costing you in MRR. For example, the data above tells us that most of this company’s cancellations are the result of customers leaving for a competitor (“Switching to another product.”) Yikes. What is the competition offering that they’re not? If it’s product-related like an integration with another software, for example, they could weigh the cost of losing customers against the cost of developing their own integration.  One problem that a lot of startups struggle with is knowing which data points to pay attention to. Cancellation data is definitely essential in your toolkit. After all, these are things costing you revenue that you could actually take action on. The most effective customer success programs accomplish two key goals:Not sure where to start or wondering where your team could improve?

We also have a direct integration with Integration, which means you can get Intercom data in Baremetrics alongside your SaaS metrics. Learn more about the integration here! Measure customer satisfaction through metrics Customer onboarding is the process of teaching your customers how to use your product. Customer onboarding usually starts during a free trial if your business offers those and continues (or restarts) after a customer converts to a paid subscription. It can also be done in a lot of different ways. Product tours, email sequences, and even live Q&A sessions can be effective for getting customers to engage with your product and learn how to do what they are paying to accomplish.A failed charge happens when your payment provider attempts a charge on a customer’s credit card and it is not successful. This usually happens to cards that are:Expired, lost, or stolen Over or approaching its limit Frozen by the bank for suspicious activity Of course, a failed charge increases the risk that you won’t get your payment. To combat this, larger companies typically have an Account Receivable team to chase after customers. But as a startup, you need to operate on a leaner headcount. This is where a revenue recovery solution can be a game changer. Recovering revenue lost to failed payments (a process sometimes also referred to as “dunning”) involves nudging delinquent customers to update their credit card information through activities like automated emails and in-app paywalls. Generally speaking, the more nudges the better, though engagement declines as time goes on, as shown in the below graph:These figures represent data collected by Baremetrics’ revenue recovery tool, Recover. Recovery rate is highest on the day of the credit card failure, which is why it’s so helpful to connect your payment provider with a recovery solution and automate the outreach process so it can start immediately. You can try Recover for 2 weeks free, with or without an existing Baremetrics subscription. Get started today.Reducing churn is a long game, but these recommendations can help your business get to the root causes of churn, address them, and get your MRR moving upwards and to the right. To ensure that you always have a pulse on your company’s metrics including churn, MRR, ARR, LTV and more, try Baremetrics free for 2 weeks. \n",
      "The Fees That Nobody Talks About (That Are Costing your Business Thousands Of Dollars).\n",
      "It's a sales trope as old as time.Buy this new car for the low price of $10,000, what a bargain!You are going to want to get the tinted window add on though they say it's going to be a hot summer this year. Obviously you will need the bundled insurance and extended warranty to protect your investment so we will throw that in there as well. Have I shown you the new bluetooth integration? It's usually only useful for people with mobile phones. You have a mobile phone!? Oh well you definitely need it!By the way we have added the heated seats at your request but there will be a monthly subscription fee to make them actually work.OK so all up your repayments will be $6,000 a month as well as the monthly payment fee and additional interest. There is also an annual transaction fee to cover financing costs.I can’t believe you were able to get a new car for only $10,000!!Payment platforms have become the modern day dealerships and credit cards are the new cars for B2B transactions.In the early days, credit cards were an easy way to pay multiple vendors with a single card and avoid the need to carry large amounts of cash. A physical card was generally required for the purchase and served as a good fraud prevention measure. But with credit came fees: membership, cash advance, overdue payment, exorbitant interest on outstanding balances and ultimately transaction fees. So when did credit cards, once a consumer product, become the tool of choice for B2B transactions? And when did entrepreneurs become comfortable giving away a huge chunk of their profitability away to transaction fees? Companies these days, from e-commerce to SaaS, find themselves absorbing these fees as an acceptable portion of their COGS as part of growing revenue.For companies that are not hitting their growth goals and indeed those that are a few % from profitability, it seems ludicrous to continue to absorb these inflated costs when there are simply better solutions out there.An article published in 2020 by the Wall Street Journal harks the emergence of this largely hidden interchange economy that has slowly crept into all aspects of retail.In one example highlighted in the article, a brick and mortar coffee and record shop spent more on card processing fees than it did on actual coffee beans. Moving this example to a SaaS or ecommerce company, one payment transaction fee is then inflated by:an additional invoicing feea billing fee to cover recurring payments, anda fee to protect the paymentThen, if god forbid a chargeback was to occur, those fees would not be refunded and you would lose the contested amount anyway.This model is not just tied to credit card transactions, as the above mentioned fees ensure you are being charged for the movement of money regardless of transaction type. For just one sale, multiple fees gnaw away at your already slim margin. How and why are entrepreneurs comfortable with this?So, what is the answer? In a recent address, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Lael Brainard, indicated the shift to real-time payments is \"inevitable”. The US Federal Government is slowly rolling out an instant payment platform called FedNow that will enable financial institutions to facilitate end-to-end payments to their customers but this has been met with some trepidation mainly revolving around how long it is taking to implement it. The thing is, you don’t have to wait for FedNow to roll out to start reducing transaction fees. There are options available now that can facilitate near real-time payments with nowhere near the inflated cost of current payment platforms.Fintech companies like Mercury are building tools that streamline payments through automations and integrations. The new wave of financial products that embrace APIs, integrations and recognise the needs of startups will forge the path towards more transparent and relevant transaction costs. Similar to Mercury, Baremetrics looks to grow alongside founders and help them make more every step of the way. Baremetrics offers insights on everything from revenue to expense forecasting and helps founders recover thousands of dollars in failed charges.Baremetrics recognises that startups and growth-stage companies are often operating on razor thin margins, and that even small improvements to COGS can have an outweighed effect on the long term success of the business. Identifying and eliminating bloated transaction fees is just one way Baremetrics can help founders achieve their purpose, so grab some time with us today and stop throwing good money after bad on failed charges and unnecessary fees.\n"

      "Integrating Baremetrics with Shopify Partners.\n",
      "If you build apps for Shopify merchants, you need to track SaaS metrics in order to accurately evaluate your business performance.The problem is that the Shopify Partners platform doesn't calculate these metrics. Rather, it only provides high-level insights. Without metrics showing you how things are going, it can feel like you’re running your business in the dark. That’s why growth-focused apps use Baremetrics, a SaaS metrics and customer engagement solution built for SaaS and subscription businesses. Baremetrics integrates seamlessly with the Shopify Partners platform to help you grow your Shopify app, faster.Read on to learn more about the benefits of integrating Shopify with Baremetrics for SaaS and subscription businesses. We’ll also explain how easy it is to set up with our pre-built integration.Here are six reasons you should consider using Shopify and Baremetrics together.In a competitive market like Shopify Partner Apps, looking at data from a variety of sources is key to identifying trends and making the right business decisions. With Baremetrics, you can overcome the tedious and complicated task of integrating different data sources and formats into a single, unified metrics dashboard.While tracking SaaS metrics is crucial for growing your Shopify Partner App business, it can be difficult to calculate them all on your own. Baremetrics calculates MRR for your Shopify Partner App along with 25+ other metrics that are essential for subscription-based businesses. In short, Baremetrics helps you make the most of your data by doing the heavy lifting for you. By pulling all of the data and consistently performing calculations, you’ll have access to accurate metrics that can help you uncover deeper insights.Every business is different, so that means there’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to analytics dashboards. The Shopify Apps dashboard only offers a high-level breakdown of installs, uninstalls, and earnings — this isn’t nearly enough information to make effective decisions to grow your SaaS business. Shopify offers a basic dashboard with some limited customization options, but Baremetrics enables you to easily create dashboards that meet your business needs. You can use drag and drop tools to build views with full control over the metrics and layouts you see. This helps you quickly review the most important data for your business.As we mentioned before, Shopify provides little insight into customer trends or churn. This limits your ability to understand what’s driving customers behavior and how you can stop them from churning. You need to be able to drill down into different customer segments, cancellations, feedback, and more.Baremetrics gives you rich customer profiles that include insights into customer behavior and failed payments. For example, you can track charges, payments, and any other transaction to better understand how things are going for individual customers. This helps you identify customers that are at risk of churning so you can make changes to maximize retention.These in-depth customer profiles help you uncover overall trends about why customers have churned in the past. That way, you can follow up with discounts, schedule sales calls, or implement other tactics to maximize customer retention for the future.Shopify analytics provides high-level insights, but when you’re relying on data to make  business decisions, it’s important to have in-depth metrics right at your fingertips. Baremetrics provides real-time metrics so that you can see what’s happening today and make timely decisions that propel your business forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Baremetrics publishes live benchmarks from over 800 small and medium sized SaaS businesses. This data includes MRR, LTV, churn, and other essential SaaS metrics grouped by average revenue per user. By comparing your metrics to other SaaS businesses within your cohort, you can set realistic goals for your business and track your progress in real time along the way.When you’re trying to understand how your business is performing, you don’t want to spend time searching through large amounts of data to find the answers you’re looking for. Instead, you’ll want to track the business metrics that are most relevant to growing a Shopify app, and segment your data to get answers to specific questions. The key to doing this lies in Baremetrics’ powerful segmentation tools– a feature that’s unavailable with Shopify Partners’ analytics. With the increased level of granularity that Baremetrics provides, you can better understand trends for specific regions, plans, or other customer segments.Shopify is a huge company, and its primary users are eCommerce store owners. Although app developers can get resources though the Shopify Partners community, individualized support can be pretty limited. In contrast, Baremetrics is built specifically for SaaS businesses and has a knowledgeable support team who can help you get the most out of your Baremetrics integration with Shopify.Baremetrics helps you get more out of your Shopify analytics, transforming your Shopify Partner App from a project into a data-driven business. By tracking the metrics most relevant to Shopify App Developers, you’ll be able to gain a deeper understanding of your business performance to make better decisions.Connecting Shopify is quick and easy using our pre-built integration. Simply create an API client in your Partners Dashboard and fill in the appropriate credentials to get started. Once you’ve set up the connection, you’ll have access to a clear dashboard with real-time insights into your business.Sign up for a free trial to discover how Baremetrics can enhance your Shopify app’s analytics today.\n",
      "Integrating Baremetrics With Stripe.\n",
      "Stripe is a powerful payment processor, but when it comes to metrics and insights, it’s limited for SaaS and subscription businesses. In other words, using Stripe by itself won’t provide you with enough insight in order to effectively grow a subscription-based business.Baremetrics is an analytics and insights solution that was purpose-built for growth-focused SaaS and subscription companies. This makes it a great compliment to Stripe’s payment processing capabilities so that you can take your business to the next level, faster.We’ve put together five reasons why you should consider using Baremetrics on top of your Stripe account. First of all, the way Stripe calculates metrics isn’t always ideal for businesses with a subscription model. For example, Stripe uses a plan’s price rather than the actual billed price when calculating metrics like monthly recurring revenue (MRR). Baremetrics, on the other hand, uses invoices to determine what customers are actually paying you, therefore giving a more accurate figure.Here’s what this might look like in real-life. Let’s say a customer signs up with 50% off for 6 months on a $100 month plan. Stripe will calculate your metrics using only the price of the plan ($100 MRR) whereas Baremetrics will include the coupon ($50 MRR). When making business decisions, it's generally recommended to be conservative with your numbers or at least make judgements based on what customers are actually paying you.Even if you don’t have a preference for how your metrics are calculated, if you want to take action on them, you should consider upgrading to a solution intentionally built for that purpose. That’s where Baremetrics comes in handy. Baremetrics allows you to drill down into your data to answer complex questions and make more informed business decisions. The key to doing this lies in Baremetrics’ powerful segmentation tools– a feature that’s unavailable with Stripe analytics. With the increased level of granularity that Baremetrics provides, you can better understand trends for specific regions, plans, or other customer segments. Here’s a real-life example of segmentation. With Baremetrics, you can learn which types of customers are churning at a greater rate than others by segmenting your customer or revenue churn rate by company size.Our customer Team Password, a password management tool, found that the churn rate for smaller companies (companies with MRR between $10K and $25K) was lower than for enterprise companies. When Team Password dug into why that was, they learned that as their customers grew in size, they developed a need for “enterprise” security features that Team Password didn’t offer. They had two options: spend resources building these enterprise-specific features or focus on smaller customers who were happy with the product exactly how it was.In the end, they decided to focus on keeping their smaller customers happy. Even though they lost some larger customers, this ultimately won them more of their ideal customers. Stripe provides analytics dashboards that help you visualize your metrics, but you’ll need advanced technical skill to customize them for more complex use cases. This all becomes extra tricky if your company has a lot of different payment plans, coupons, or payment providers.As an example, consider what it takes to pull the billing history of Stripe customers. You’d need to add some code to the Stripe List Charge API, which is tedious and unnecessarily complicated for most people. This information (and much more) is readily available within the Baremetrics dashboard.Once it’s connected to Stripe, Baremetrics automatically pulls information about your customers and their past activity from the payment processor and creates a custom analytics dashboard for Stripe. This allows you to view insights that are tailored to your specific business requirements without any complicated technical skills.  \n",
      "You can also build your own views using drag and drop tools. By having full control over the metrics and layouts of your dashboards, you’ll be able to easily review the data most important to your business whenever you want. For example, seeing metrics from customers within a specific region. While Stripe offers some revenue recovery capabilities, it’s limited when compared to a more comprehensive dunning solution. Here’s why: Stripe’s “Smart Retries” feature doesn’t offer much customization, preventing you from sending highly personalized and engaging dunning emails that effectively recover revenue.This is where Recover by Baremetrics wins: as an add-on tool to your Baremetrics subscription, it helps you automatically resolve failed customer payments to recover lost revenue while also delivering a positive customer experience. It works by automatically sending custom dunning email campaigns, in-app notifications, and paywalls, you can work with your customers to ensure the subscription payment process is as smooth as possible. Stripe is a payment processor that works with many types of online businesses, not just SaaS and subscription ones. When it comes to processing payments, a company’s business model doesn’t matter so much, but SaaS and subscription companies should definitely seek tools that help them analyze free trials and cancellation activity- two essential factors for customer retention in SaaS. That’s another reason why Stripe users rely on Baremetrics. Trial Insights provides in-depth data about how your free trials are progressing. With insights like conversion rate, average trial length, converted trials and more (see below), you can keep a pulse on trends surrounding your free trials, and where you could be improving. Similarly, with Cancellation Insights, you can collect invaluable feedback about why customers are canceling their subscription and then automatically send personalized emails to encourage them to return.You can follow up with discounts, schedule sales calls, or implement other tactics for getting customers to reactivate their subscriptions. This is a simple way for you to maximize your customer retention in a scalable way.Stripe is first and foremost a payment processor, not an analytics and insights solution. That means its customer support is focused on resolving issues with your customers paying you. Baremetrics offers personalized support for your company’s unique growth-related questions and needs.. Since Baremetrics is built specifically for SaaS and subscription businesses, our Customer Success team has both industry and Stripe expertise to help you make the most of your Baremetrics integration with Stripe.Baremetrics can bring your raw Stripe data to life in a way that transforms your company into a data-driven business. You’ll have the data visualizations and insights you need to make better decisions to grow your subscription-based business.Connecting Stripe with Baremetrics is easy using our pre-built integration. Simply link your Stripe account and Baremetrics will import your data and then calculate your metrics. Then you’ll be able to analyze your business performance in real-time. Baremetrics tracks 26 key metrics for SaaS and subscription companies, including MRR, lifetime value, failed charges, churn, and much more.Besides in-depth analytics for Stripe data, Baremetrics offers dunning and customer engagement tools to optimize your business operations. You’ll be able to recover lost revenue due to failed payments, reduce customer churn, and engage your customers in a way that builds stronger relationships.

      "Scenario Forecasting – What Is It, And Why Does Your Saas Company Need It.\n",
      "Business, like life, can be highly unpredictable, but that doesn’t stop us from trying to predict the future. Passively letting the future unfold isn’t an acceptable alternative that leads to extraordinary outcomes. Therefore, running a successful business requires forethought and forecasting. We’re often wrong despite our best efforts to plan for the future. We usually chalk it up to our forecasting prowess when things turn out as planned. When not, we wonder what we could have done differently or blame the world for not playing along. Outstanding leaders prepare for even the most unlikely yet possible cases. Scenario forecasting can help us run these “what-if?” scenarios and plan for both the probable and the unimaginable. Then, wild events like a global pandemic or a supply-chain squeeze don’t catch you off guard. But it’s not only for major, once-in-a-century global events. Leaders and managers can use scenario forecasting to plan for smaller topics, like assessing a potential new project. Or they can use scenarios to help determine your company’s direction in more significant strategic situations, like wondering if you should purchase your closest competitor. Scenario planning can help ensure you’re ready for just about anything.Scenario forecasting is a strategic method businesses use to plan for various potential futures. These scenarios are typically based on visible risks and assumed uncertainties surrounding a set of plausible situations. In short, modeling multiple “what-if” scenarios helps you prepare for the future.  Typically, scenario planning aims to anticipate changes resulting from events inside the company and external factors. You can use it to find weaknesses in your organization and  assumptions or to assess the viability of new ideas, projects, and strategies. On a macro scale, scenario forecasting can be a core aspect of strategy development and to drive long-term planning decisions. But companies can also use it for smaller, more short-term topics. For example, to answer questions like:Or to assess our resilience and flexibility in a significant global crisis.A typical scenario planning exercise will focus on two to five scenarios. Some modeling experts prefer the higher end, and some prefer two distinct scenarios. More than five scenarios make it hard to keep your assumptions straight, while three is also not ideal. Most people will try to pick the middle scenario — choosing either the most moderate option or the most plausible one that fits with the current “official future.”In many cases, two or four become the optimal number of scenarios to reduce the likelihood of picking the middle plan. Because scenario planning takes time, it’s essential to do it in a way that adds value to your organization’s strategy development. Each scenario should be distinct enough to see the divergence and provide enough details to enable objective evaluation. These scenarios can help you assess:Because the answers to these questions aren’t strictly quantitative, scenario planning can provide more valuable information for strategic decisions than traditional forecasting. But that doesn’t mean traditional forecasting provides zero value. Traditional forecasting is used to predict the future based on historical data. A traditional forecast focuses on one scenario — a middle scenario — showing the most moderate assumptions along with the most probable outcome. But traditional forecasting and long-term planning methods have a significant flaw: They’re often rooted in the assumption that the future will be like the present.While that’s sometimes true, often it’s not. Royal Dutch Shell is considered a grandfather of modern scenario planning for businesses. For over 50 years, the company has developed and improved the scenario forecasting process to guide long-term strategy and to help prepare for potential crises. People involved in Shell’s scenario modeling practice believe that scenarios should be plausible but not probable because they aren’t predictions, unlike traditional forecasting. A good scenario must provide different ways of looking at the future and strike a balance between challenging and relevant:“Relevant can be too familiar, but challenging can go unheard.” - Angela Wilkinson and Roland Kupers, Harvard Business Review: Living in the Futures.A trick is developing the scenario’s story and then quantifying it. A core belief of Shell’s scenario modeling team centers around the optimism bias most people carry, with a tendency to look for familiar patterns, becoming blind to the unexpected. But the unexpected can lead to massive disruptions — presenting either a huge opportunity or significant risk to companies assuming that the status quo will continue.Scenario ForecastingTraditional ForecastingScenario forecasting can be complex and time-consuming, but the insights gained can be invaluable. In traditional settings, full-blown planning of major scenarios can take several months, from the initial workshop to ripe summaries for management review. From the outset to the end, there are brainstorming sessions and interviews, research and writing, and finally, the scenarios are together.Scenario planning for your SaaS might also take some time, although, with the proper tools, it shouldn’t be a months-long process.The first step to putting together a scenario forecast is to identify the problem you’re trying to solve or the question you’re trying to answer. This step is essential because it narrows the team’s field of view from a seemingly infinite number of options. The initial phase of scenario planning involves wading a lot of clarifying questions to determine the focus of the scenarios:Once the problem is clearly defined, the questions don’t stop. There are additional points to address surrounding the data required for the analysis and the internal factors impacting the scenario. The last part of this first step is identifying the necessary information's location. This can be a critical path, especially if securing access to the data might be challenging. The easiest option, especially for a SaaS company, is to have most (or all) of the necessary data well organized in a unified tool, like a financial system linked to your CRM metrics and other analytics. When data resides in immature IT systems or even externally, i.e., in another organizational unit or outside of the company’s systems, securing it becomes crucial. As managers and individuals, we imagine exercising complete control over our futures, forgetting that we’re often subject to external factors and influences. Defining these forces is essential to creating meaningful scenarios. External factors that massively impact your forecast can vary from run-of-the-mill undesirable occurrences to black swan events that are nearly impossible to imagine. Consider the following examples of potential influencing factors:You could also put internal company factors outside the scenario planner’s control in this category. Maybe there’s a yet-unannounced plan to spin off a division or kill a legacy product that could majorly impact a variety of scenarios. There could even be seemingly minor factors that could have significant effects. Imagine that the AdWords budget is cut in half after a few slower months, drastically reducing your flow of inbound leads. Although it’s impossible to consider all possible external forces and their relationships and interdependencies, use your team’s imagination and creativity. It may not be so critical for smaller scenario planning topics. Try to go beyond the obvious factors and forces to get to the limit of real possibilities, especially for long-term strategic planning. The list of factors and forces potentially impacting your scenario can be seemingly endless. Once you’ve identified as many factors and influences as possible, it’s critical to prioritize the uncertainties. With the team, determine which are most critical, then settle on the 2-5 scenarios and factors that can provide the most insight. This prioritization can help the team allocate limited time and resources to address a short list of crucial uncertainties. Modeling hundreds of variables could take years, even with powerful computers at your disposal.Adding numbers too early can skew your scenarios to be much more middling and unrepresentative than if you wait until the end. In the Shell model for scenario building mentioned previously, quantifying the scenarios is one of the final steps. First, develop the story behind the scenario. Only when the story is clear, plausible, and relevant can you build the model around it. The numbers that come out of the stories are more credible, and simply relying on quantitative models can hide your assumptions instead of allowing you to refine them. Even at this late stage of the scenario planning process, it’s worth constantly questioning your assumptions, even those most central to your model. The scenario planning exercise aims to destroy the belief that the future will be like the present and ensure your company is as prepared as possible for multiple futures.After quantifying your factors and developing your scenario stories, you can finally run your data through the model. As with creating the story, continue questioning your assumptions. Continuously tweak your variables to ensure that the model makes sense and that your assumptions aren’t ridiculously flawed. If you set up your scenario model only to discover that you’re breaking the boundaries of reality, it’s time to reassess. Is all this talk of stories and scenarios and the Royal Dutch Shell oil company too nebulous? Let’s link it back to the realities of running a SaaS business. As with traditional forecasting, scenario forecasting aims to make better decisions about your business and ensure you’re prepared for whatever the future brings. If you can imagine and model a few alternatives to the “official future,” you’re much less likely to be caught off-balance each time things don’t go as planned.Much of running a business involves having the right product or being the correct size. The right size for your staff depends largely on revenue and revenue growth. You’ll probably arrive at a “most likely” scenario through your planning processes. Based on that, you’ll have a pretty good model of what the future will bring and what that means for your SaaS company’s staffing needs. Using scenario planning to forecast revenue and develop a plausible outlook for your SaaS metrics can ensure you’re working toward a correct staffing level.For example, suppose you project your company’s monthly recurring revenue (MRR) to triple over the next six months. In that case, it’s fair to assume you’ll also need to hire additional staff to support those new customers. On the other hand, imagine that most of your scenarios point to decreasing conversion rates driven by a shift in consumer interests. Of course, you have several options. But most involve adapting or limiting investment in the current product and pivoting to something new. Or if you expect a recession to come in the next 12-18 months and flatten your customer demand, slowing your SaaS’s growth, you’d be wise to consider implementing levers to develop flexible service capacity.  Scenario forecasting helps you identify the most likely scenario and right-size your business. Scenario forecasting can help you develop better, more in-demand products by building your product roadmap onto the most likely scenario. Imagine your team has an idea for a new product. Bringing a new product to the market can be expensive and risky. While it’s possible to mitigate many of those risks, multiple external factors can influence the outcome. Scenario planning can help answer critical questions on both the cost and revenue sides to decide if developing a new product is a good idea.The internal questions to address are:And here are the external questions:Although it’s impossible to de-risk running your business entirely, scenario forecasting can help. By modeling different scenarios and proceeding with the most likely, it’s possible to improve internal decision-making for your SaaS company. When you’re running a SaaS company, your tech stack is business-critical. Scenario forecasting can help keep your product running by showing when you’ll need which tech stack improvements.  Your SaaS relies on many tech-related variables, from the programming languages you choose for front- and back-end to your cloud service provider and more. These variables impact your uptime and customer satisfaction, which will probably change as your service develops and your customer base grows. It’s not possible to run the same setup when you’re serving 50 customers and when you’re serving 5,000 or 50,000.It’s also possible to turn the scenario around. What about modeling the impact of an upgrade to your tech stack? Your tech stack can also help you drive business growth. Modeling multiple scenarios can help you determine when it’s time to upgrade and how to adjust different aspects of your tech stack to ensure maximum uptime and customer satisfaction. Although scenario forecasting sounds complex, most people constantly perform some form of scenario modeling in their personal and professional lives. It’s not a formal process, and many wouldn’t call it scenario forecasting, but that’s what it is — planning the outcome of various scenarios based on visible and invisible risks and assumptions.Formalizing the process in your business can help you make better decisions and proactively prepare for an unpredictable future. And scenario planning for your SaaS metrics doesn’t need to be complex — tools like Baremetrics simplify modeling. While you probably can’t avoid putting time and effort into developing the stories and defining assumptions and variables, you can make modeling those stories much more manageable.Flightpath by Baremetrics lets you easily and quickly create multiple scenarios to model all possible outcomes for your business.Curious about how scenario forecasting can improve your business?

      "QuickBooks Online vs. Xero.\n",
      "Whether you’re just starting or have already established a robust company, knowing where you stand financially is essential for running a business. A core element of handling your financials is an accounting solution to track costs and revenue on top of managing your invoicing. Fortunately, the days of business accounting on giant paper spreadsheets are long gone. Instead, we have a seemingly unfathomable selection of cloud-based accounting solutions at our fingertips. QuickBooks Online and Xero are among the most popular accounting tools. Both possess strengths and weaknesses aimed at attracting similar yet distinct audiences.Deciding on an accounting solution is a very personal decision, so let’s start at the beginning.These web-based accounting tools target growing and established business customers. Because QuickBooks Online (QBO) and Xero compete for similar audiences, they share many features and similarities. Each provider’s various subscription plans offer something for everyone — from the solopreneur sending just a handful of invoices each year to the medium-sized enterprise managing inventory and fixed assets. Accounting is a critical business process with wide-reaching impacts. So it goes without saying that an accounting system must be stable and robust. Founders and managers make decisions based on the information provided by their accounting tools, and financial data from those systems are used to file tax returns and pay suppliers.These similarities make deciding on one over the other a tricky proposition. The best one for you depends mainly on your business’s specific operational and accounting needs and may even change over time.These popular accounting tools are robust and easy to use. First-time implementers can quickly get started and scale up as their business grows. Although the software solutions can be relied on to manage your accounting, you as the end-user are ultimately responsible. Refreshing your basic accounting knowledge will ensure you understand what’s happening in the tools and help you get the most from both.The backbone of both tools is the link to your bank accounts, which establishes the basis for your financial reporting. Integrating the feeds and reconciling bank transactions with your bookkeeping accounts involves a semi-manual matching and categorizing of your transactions. Both Xero and QBO will suggest matches based on previous account activity, and you’ll need to confirm that the proposal makes sense. If the match is incorrect, you’ll be able to add a new transaction type or manually allocate the booking.Further, providing your accountant access to your books is not an issue with either tool. Simply share a link by email, and they should be up and running in a matter of minutes. Xero offers three plans: Early, Growing, and Established. Beyond the low starting price of the Early package, all three levels are slightly less expensive than the comparable package from QuickBooks Online. Although choosing an accounting software based on price alone probably isn’t wise, it can help prevent you from getting more functionality than you need. Besides the Early tier’s low price point (especially for self-employed people sending less than 20 invoices a year), all Xero pricing tiers permit access to an unlimited number of users. For businesses with many people requiring access to financial data, Xero is generally better, as QuickBooks Online maxes out at 25 on the most expensive plan. Xero lets businesses manage inventory tracking and fixed assets on all plans. With QBO, inventory is only available on the higher-tier plans, and users must manually create fixed assets. One outstanding element of Xero is the number of available third-party integration tools across a wide range of industries and categories. This level of expansion can make up for Xero’s limited options for reporting and customization.Finally, Xero offers 24/7 online customer support for all users. And they doesn’t outsource this support to third parties; their employees provide it.QuickBooks Online vs. Xero is a relatively equal match in many respects. However, there are a few spots where QBO has a clear edge. Both tools make data-sharing with accountants straightforward. But because QBO has more users (especially in the US), your accountant is more likely to be familiar with the tools and setup.  When it comes to tracking transactions, QBO is much more flexible than Xero. While both Xero and QBO link to your bank feed, QuickBooks allows up to 40 tags for the three main tiers, plus unlimited tags for the advanced plan. Xero limits you to two active tracking categories. A complex business with a wide variety of transactions can benefit from the granularity provided by QuickBooks. Another significant benefit to choosing QuickBooks Online over Xero is scalability. As your business grows and you become more advanced, the level of reporting detail you desire might change. Although QBO limits the overall number of users, experienced business owners who need more complex reporting now and in the future will benefit from customizable reporting features.A business’s cash flow statement is essential for managing cash flow and ensuring the company can pay its workers and cover obligations to suppliers. QuickBooks permits both the indirect and direct methods of calculating your cash flow statement, whereas Xero users are limited to the direct approach. Some business models lead to a strong preference for one over the other.In terms of other tools, QBO offers a bit more surrounding general business topics:Time tracking capabilities at all service levelsEasy managing of 1099sAbility to plan quarterly taxesTax exports to help your accountant better prepare your taxesTo sum it up, both Xero and QuickBooks Online are attractive accounting software options. Although the best choice for your business will depend on your specific requirements, QBO has a slight edge for many applications. It’s been around longer, is more customizable, and offers a good variety of reporting and other tools.Accounting is an essential element of running a business, but it’s primarily a reflection of the past. Equally important, and often far more interesting to a business owner, is where you’re going. Many people believe that a historical trajectory will continue indefinitely. But that’s often not the case, especially in business. Forecasting is a critical aspect of building a successful business because it requires you to regularly redefine (or confirm) your business’s trajectory based on your current situation and latest assumptions. Because a forecast is a hypothetical model of the future, you have the opportunity to make changes if it doesn’t look like you’re heading in the right direction. While QuickBooks Online and Xero are capable accounting solutions, they’re light in the forecasting department. Fortunately, third-party forecasting solutions like Flightpath are available to users of both.Most accounting solutions come with only basic forecasting functionality. Here are four main reasons someone using QuickBooks Online or Xero would want to use Flightpath.To get an automatically updating, customized financial model that works for your business, you’ll need a third-party solution like Flightpath by Baremetrics. The ability to link directly with your CRM tools anchors your forecast in financial AND non-financial metrics. Plus, our team is available for hands-on support along the way.The transaction tagging available in QBO is helpful, but bank-level information simply can’t split revenue by channel, product, or source. More granularity means better visibility of how each revenue source is performing and if it’s meeting expectations. Scenario modeling is a powerful tool that too few businesses use. Creating multiple scenarios to model the best case, worst case, and average case based on your sales funnel can help you make better decisions.Linking to your actual accounting and CRM data allows you to define rules and methods to create a rolling forecast to better model your business’s progress.Flightpath integrates with Google Sheets to allow you to work with the worksheets function. This functionality gives team members the ability to create their own metrics and rules for forecasting (i.e., revenue per employee).QuickBooks Online and Xero are both powerful accounting tools with long lists of pros and cons. The best solution for you depends mainly on your business and preferences. But whether you choose QuickBooks Online or Xero, limited forecasting abilities in both tools make a third-party solution like Flightpath by Baremetrics necessary. Seamlessly integrate data from either system with info from your CRM or other tools and build a forecast model that gives you real insight into your business.Curious about what you could accomplish with an integrated forecasting solution?

      "How Smart Passive Income Grew its Private Membership Community and Recovered $8k in Failed Payments With Baremetrics.\n",
      "CHALLENGE: The Smart Passive Income (SPI) team uses a lot of tools to run their business. Many of these tools have their own analytics dashboard, but they aren't connected to each other, which limits the usable data SPI has access to. Recovering failed payments from members of the SPI Pro community is a challenge, too, which the SPI team needed to solve.SOLUTION: Baremetrics gives the SPI leadership team a complete look at their membership subscription  data. They can see, from one convenient dashboard, every piece of relevant information, which they can then use to make better decisions that affect performance. SPI also uses Baremetrics' dunning tool, Recover, to recuperate lost revenue and ensure the memberships don’t slip through the cracks.RESULT: With Baremetrics, the SPI team has the information they need to make business decisions with confidence and grow their membership base. They've also used Recover to get back $8k in lost payments due to credit card expirations and similar issues in 12 months.SPI Pro is the natural evolution of Smart Passive Income, the popular blog that Pat Flynn started in 2008. For 12 years, Pat used SPI to build an audience, which he then monetized by selling high-end courses that dug deeper into the topics he covered on his blog, such as podcasting, email marketing, and other essential skills for the modern-day creator.In 2020, Pat merged SPI with his long-time creative agency partner to form a new media company (SPI Media) with the aim of expanding valuable products and services to meet the growing needs of the creator economy. Chief among those needs was a safe space where early-stage creators and online entrepreneurs could gather; meet, support, and learn from one another; have more direct access to Pat, Matt Gartland (his business partner), and the rest of Team SPI, and much more. That desire for a private community fueled the creation of SPI Pro, their application-based membership community that runs on Circle.In other words, it's a private group of bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and course creators who receive top-shelf education and networking opportunities in exchange for a monthly fee.SPI has always tried to analyze their metrics from whatever core tools they use to operate various parts of the business. But they had difficulty connecting the dots between the analytics from the different tools they were using.According to Pat, the company used to \"look at whatever metrics were native to the platforms we used. For instance, ConvertKit has some good metrics that give us insight into our email marketing performance.\"But analyzing individual platform metrics was time-consuming and didn't give the SPI team the complete picture they needed, especially for SPI Pro. Plus, SPI wanted to \"grow up properly as a company and have more rigorous financial insight,\" says Matt, SPI's CEO.This led Matt to Baremetrics, which he implemented at the outset of SPI Pro’s launch in the summer of 2020, because, \"Baremetrics just makes it easy. It's more approachable, more illustrative, and, sometimes, it's just more fun.\"Matt and his team dig into Baremetrics on a regular basis to analyze performance and conversion data and to make sure that new subscribers are billed correctly. \"Baremetrics is an essential tool in our toolkit to be able to understand what's going on with our business.\"When SPI Pro launched, they offered two payment options: members could pay on a monthly basis, or receive a discount and pay on an annual basis.But, after reviewing the data in Baremetrics, the SPI team decided to sunset the monthly subscription option in favor of a quarterly payment option. In Matt's own words, \"Based on what we saw in Baremetrics, in terms of the split factor between monthly and annual retention rates and churn elements, we thought we could perform better.\"In addition to organizing their customer and subscription data, SPI uses Recover to recoup revenue lost to failed charges, which is a constant struggle for founders running subscription-based products and companies. It works by automating email campaigns, in-app reminders, and paywalls that help fight against things like expired credit card numbers, insufficient funds, and other common credit card issues.\"I will always sing Stripe's praises, but we weren't impressed with the results of its dunning software,\" Matt says. \"Having increased control with Baremetrics is essential. We're able to include SPI branding and change timeframes really easily with Recover.\"Matt also appreciates how Recover makes the dunning process more personal through customizable email content. He says:\"Nobody wants to hear that their credit card has failed and they're delinquent on something. Because Recover is so easy to use and customizable, it allows our CX team to handle the payment recovery process instead of marketing, which customers seem to appreciate.\"Altogether, SPI has been able to recoup $8k in lost revenue from SPI Pro membership subscriptions with Recover!Are you an aspiring creator and online entrepreneur? Then you'll almost certainly benefit from SPI Pro.Beyond SPI Pro, visit the Smart Passive Income website for tons of free articles and resources.And if you need a top-rated analytics and reporting tool, take a look at Baremetrics. Our solution will give you the MRR, ARR, and churn rate data you need to run your subscription business more efficiently, generate more revenue, and achieve more success.This is especially true for professional creators, in Matt's opinion, who take their business performance seriously and prefer to make data-driven decisions instead of being ruled by their emotions.He says, \"As more creators find traction and find themselves motivated to sell something with a subscription, that has MRR, these folks need to be thinking about a tool like Baremetrics.\" Start your free 14-day trial of Baremetrics today!\n",
      "How Grokability Recovered $150k in Failed Charges With Baremetrics.\n",
      "Challenge: Grokability's founder, Alison Gianotto, needed a quick way to evaluate how her business was doing. She was so swamped with other tasks, she didn't have time to dig for answers. These days, time isn't as much of an issue, but recovering payments is.Solution: Baremetrics was there for Alison in the beginning, helping her visualize company data quickly so that she could make decisions with confidence. And it's there for her today, continuing to help Grokability recover thousands of dollars in lost revenue every month.Result: Because of Baremetrics, Alison had the time and information she needed to grow her business back in 2016. Now, Baremetrics is integrated into everything Grokability does, giving Alison and her team accurate data and helping them recover $150k in failed payments. Like many great businesses, Grokability was started out of necessity.In 2013, Grokability's founder, Alison Gianotto, held the CTO position at an ad agency in New York City. The agency was moving to a new office and Alison was asked to inventory all company assets to make sure they remained accounted for throughout the process.Unfortunately, the asset management tools available to her at the time were subpar. So Alison did what every great entrepreneur has done before her: she built her own solution.In 2015, Grokability became an official business. It had one product, Snipe-IT, the asset management tool Alison had created a couple of years before. Since then, the Grokability team has created a second product, GoodForms, an ethical email verification service.But it wasn't all rainbows and sunshine along the way…In her own words, Alison felt completely \"overwhelmed\" when running her business. It's not surprising—she was managing the help desk, working on installations, and writing software code all by herself. Suffice to say, Alison was strapped for time.Luckily, Alison discovered Baremetrics in 2016, which allowed her to easily visualize company metrics and glean company insights, without having to build her own tool from scratch. This enabled Alison to focus on other aspects of her business and grow Grokability.6+ years later, Alison and the Grokability team still use Baremetrics on a daily basis. She says, \"I've used other apps. But I like the Baremetrics interface, the pricing structure, and the insights the tool gives me. It helps guide us in the direction we need to go.\"Grokability uses Baremetrics in a wide variety of ways.In our interview with Alison, we talked about four specific Baremetrics features that Grokability loves, as well as the \"Open Startups\" initiative, which Baremetrics founded in 2015.Like every other successful SaaS business, Grokability regularly monitors customer churn.In fact, Alison hosts a company-wide meeting every week to discuss who recently signed up for Grokability's service, who recently canceled, and potential reasons for new churn.\"Yes, this is my company,\" Alison says. \"But I don't have all of the answers. Engaging the whole team in churn discussions helps us brainstorm new solutions. It also gives my employees a voice, which makes them feel more invested in Grokability's success.\"Recover, a dunning solution, is one of Baremetrics' add-on features.With it, users are able to recover a significant portion of lost revenue via customizable email campaigns, in-app reminders, and paywalls that help fight against things like expired credit card numbers, insufficient funds, and other typical banking issues.According to Alison, Grokability didn't always use Baremetrics to recover failed payments. But because the team was happy with Baremetrics' analytics suite, they decided to add Recover to their subscription. That way both analytics and dunning processes could be handled \"under one roof.\"This turned out to be a great decision!Alison and her team use Recover with a Baremetrics hosted URL, to collect updated payment information from customers as efficiently as possible. The result? Grokability has recovered more than $150k in lost revenue in the last 3 years!\"One of the things I really appreciate about Baremetrics is that you can mark a point in time.\"Businesses change every day. Some of these changes are for the better, but others… Not so much. It's important to know how your business is changing and why. That way you can properly assess company metrics and manage operations with confidence.Baremetrics helps Grokability evaluate company changes via the annotations feature.Was that last email blast successful? Have our customer support KPIs gone up since we made our last hire. How has the pandemic impacted our sales and retention metrics?To answer these questions, Alison simply has to access the Grokability dashboard in Baremetrics and mark a point in time. She can then assess company metrics from the specific moment she marks to determine the root cause of company changes—good or bad.More importantly, Alison can evaluate whether each change translates to positive, sustainable results. If they do, she knows she can double down on current tactics. If not, she knows that she needs to alter her strategy. Either way, Baremetrics helps Grokability identify spikes in important metrics like MRR and churn rate, which they use to understand historical seasonality and predict future trends.Benchmarks, a popular feature inside Baremetrics, enables users to easily compare their company to other SaaS businesses. This allows them to accurately gauge performance.Cohorts are grouped by Average Revenue Per User, essentially the average amount you bill a given customer. The data below shows how you compare with other companies who bill similar amounts.As Alison says, \"When you're a small business, you don't know if you're 'doing it right.' Being able to see where you're doing great and where you could improve—across multiple industries within the same cohort and price range, no less—is super important.\"Benchmarks help companies pinpoint where they’re succeeding, and where they can improve. They can then experiment to try and increase MRR, reduce customer churn, and otherwise grow their company.At Baremetrics, we started the \"Open Startups\" initiative to bring transparency and openness to the world of business. This is something that resonated with Alison and the Grokability team.\"Technology, as an industry, is full of posturing. Real honesty, both to your customers and to your employees, and having open conversations in terms of business finances, is important.\"This level of transparency has really helped Grokability when it comes to hiring. Top talent appreciates the open way that Grokability operates. As a result, the company is regularly approached by people looking for work. This makes the recruitment process much easier.As Alison says, \"When you have a culture of transparency, people want to work with you.\"If you'd like to join the \"Open Startups\" initiative, you can do so here.At the very least, consider visiting the page and joining thousands of other people who have subscribed to our email list and now receive free lessons on how to grow their startups!To learn more about Grokability, visit their website and read their blog, where Alison and her team share product updates, business-building tips, and more.

      "An Introduction to Non-Dilutive Fundraising for SaaS.\n",
      "What does every SaaS founder want? To grow their companies—the faster, the better. But here's the thing: company growth always comes at a cost.For many SaaS companies, the cost of growth is ownership. Founders give up a portion of their businesses in exchange for money, which they then pour into marketing, sales, product development, and anything else they believe will help their company reach the next level.This has been the standard approach to SaaS growth for years. But times are changing…We recently sat down with Jamie Maynard, the Head of Enterprise Sales and Strategic Originations at Capchase, and Joey Frasier, the Co-Founder and CEO of Worksuite.Capchase is a non-dilutive funding solution for SaaS and subscription-based businesses. Partnering with them allows SaaS founders to get the money they need to grow—without having to give up a piece of their company in the process.Worksuite is a revolutionary freelancer management platform that has worked with Capchase to fuel company growth and ensure its founders maintain company control.In our talk with Jamie and Joey, we discuss the current funding landscape for SaaS businesses, how to choose between equity capital and non-dilutive funding, and the importance of tracking SaaS metrics from the very beginning.Note: This article is a summary of our talk with Jamie and Joey. Would you rather watch the full event and get every juicy detail? You can do so here.The SaaS industry is on a bit of a hot streak, which makes sense.In Jamie's words, \"Everyone who wasn't SaaS is converting over to SaaS, because who doesn't love the consistency of recurring revenue models?\"Venture capitalists have taken notice and poured giant stacks of cash into the SaaS space. Unfortunately, said cash isn't distributed evenly. There are tons of high-potential SaaS companies that can't acquire VC funding because they haven't yet established a proven track record of success.This fact has led to a gap in the market. How do SaaS companies scale at a rapid pace if they can't bootstrap themselves to success, get a loan, or land an investment from a VC?For many SaaS founders, the answer is to seek alternative funding.To wrap your head around the alternative funding options available to SaaS companies, you have to understand the difference between equity capital and non-dilutive funding.Equity capital is the money that investors pay companies in exchange for ownership. If your company is worth a million dollars and your rich uncle offers you $500k in equity capital, he's offering to buy half of your company from you.Non-dilutive funding, on the other hand, is any form of funding that does NOT force founders to relinquish ownership of their companies. Bank loans, government grants, crowdfunding, product royalties, vouchers, and tax credits all fall into this category.According to Jamie, \"Equity capital is often essential to get a company off the ground.\" Hiring engineers to create a SaaS product is expensive. Most founders don't have the funds they need in their savings accounts, which forces them to rely on other people's money. But very few people will give you money without a significant reward in return, i.e. ownership.If your rich uncle gives you $500k now, he's basically saying, \"I believe in your vision and I want to help you achieve your dream. But there's no guarantee that this will work out. So, to compensate me for the risk I'm taking, I want half of your company. That way, if you become successful and your company goes up in value, I'm rewarded for putting my trust in you.\"It makes sense, but it's not always the preferred option. Most founders want to own as much of their companies as they possibly can, which may lead them to seek non-dilutive funding.So, when does non-dilutive funding make sense for SaaS companies? The answer is, it depends. But here are a few use cases to think about:Are you ready to grow your company? Non-dilutive funds can be allocated to marketing departments to help get the word out about your SaaS products.They can also be used to hire new sales reps to help your business acquire new customers. Or sent to product development so that you can finally add new features, which your marketing team can then promote to your target audience and, hopefully, boost subscriptions.\"What we've noticed with a lot of enterprise SaaS,\" Jamie says, \"is that they're charging annual upfront subscriptions. And that's fantastic from a cash flow perspective.\" But then they have to wait, \"365 days before the next subscription is collected.\"There are \"inherent cash flow gaps\" in a lot of SaaS businesses. Non-dilutive funds can help bridge these gaps and ensure SaaS brands have the money they need, when they need it.Sometimes, the best way to take a SaaS brand to the next level is to merge with and/or acquire another company. Non-dilutive funds can be used for this purpose as well.Just be aware, in order for a company like Capchase to fund your acquisition, you need to prove to them that the acquisition will provide revenue or some sort of synergy. In addition, Capchase won't fund multiples on annual recurring revenue (ARR).Joey says, \"From the beginning, have a good set of systems for your data, which then give you your metrics… That way you have that history available when you [seek financing].\"Nobody is going to just give you money and say, \"Good luck!\" Well, your mom might. But we're going to assume that your mom doesn't have enough money to fund your SaaS business, which means you'll have to seek funding elsewhere.This is much easier to do if you can pull up your metrics dashboard and show potential investors the number of customers you have, the revenue you currently generate, etc.Your metrics will help you after you acquire funding, too.As Joey explains, founders can, \"Leverage metrics to say, we know if we invest a dollar here, we're going to get four back.\" Or maybe, \"Let's bring in some funds, based on… our future ARR, and leverage that to bring in some additional development resources.\"In other words, your metrics will help tell you how to spend money once you acquire it.This is really important when accepting non-dilutive funds from institutions like Capchase because, in Joey's own words, \"You have to pay the money back!\" So, \"Make sure you have a plan for where you're going to spend that money, and spend it wisely.\"Growth will cost you something. Fortunately, thanks to alternative funding options like those provided by Capchase, ownership of your SaaS company doesn't have to be the thing.Non-dilutive funding is an attractive option for a wide range of SaaS founders because it gives them access to the capital they need to grow their companies, while allowing them to maintain ownership and control of the business they've worked so hard to build.To learn more about Capchase and whether its approach to alternative funding is right for your SaaS company, visit the Capchase website.Just remember what Jamie and Joey said: you can't secure funding, equity-based or non-dilutive, without a solid handle on your company's metrics. And the best way to get a handle on your metrics is to invest in a quality reporting solution like Baremetrics.Baremetrics makes it easy to pinpoint your company's MRR, ARR, churn rate, and more. It's also equipped with tools to help you discover why customers cancel, recover failed payments, and forecast future performance with a high level of accuracy.

      "Budget vs. Actual: How to Use Variance Analysis to Drive SaaS Success.\n",
      "How do you know what’s working in your business and what isn’t? Even if you’ve got a pretty good gut feel for the company, how do you know?Keeping tabs on what’s performing and what’s not isn’t easy, especially in a SaaS business with a thousand moving parts. Budget vs. actual analysis can help you follow what’s going right or wrong more easily so that you can take action. But what is budget vs. actual, and how can it help you get the most out of your business?Making a budget for your startup is essential because defining the path to your company’s goals is a critical step toward reaching them. Creating a budget allows you to outline where you want to go. And splitting that budget into months (or quarters, if by month is too granular) lets you see how you’ll get there month by month. Although building a solid budget isn’t easy, it’s only half the job. The other half of the equation is execution. And execution can be hard.To help you along the way, you need an assortment of variance analyses. One of the most important is budget vs. actual.Budget vs. actual compares how the company performs (the actuals) with the defined target (the budget) over fixed periods.Getting actionable information from your analysis requires comparing the actual figures against the budget figures with enough granularity to be useful for decision making. You can start with the significant blocks like:Revenue Material or cost of revenue (for SaaS, this includes customer service and hosting) Gross profit Gross margin (in %) Other expense categories applicable to your company (i.e., marketing, general and administrative costs, R&D) Net incomeFor further details, link your financial figures to non-financial metrics that serve as the building blocks for your revenue, i.e., CRM metrics like churn and conversion rates. Adding these can provide even more insight into where the company is not performing as it should. Significant gaps should be analyzed in terms of absolute values and percentages. For example, a 25% gap is enormous but doesn’t have the same impact on a $100 line as it would on a $500k line. Focus on high magnitude gaps first, then move to lower value deviations.With the budget (or a forecast), you’ve defined a baseline against which you can measure your actual performance. The analysis serves two primary purposes:Shows company leadership that the company is on or off track.Highlights areas that require additional focus.The company’s reporting system must be robust enough to help the management team look at the big picture AND drill down into the details. Areas that need focus are generally those with the most significant variations, either on their own or in comparison with other metrics. For example, if your cost of revenue increases 20% vs. budget, but so does your annual recurring revenue (ARR), the expected link between the two indicates little cause for concern. On the other hand, if your revenue increases by 5% but your sales and marketing balloons by 50%, that’s cause for investigation. This methodology applies to financial and other metrics, like conversions, leads, and top-of-funnel metrics. The key is to first set the baseline for each set of metrics, either in a budget or a forecast.The outcome of the variance analysis can then determine necessary actions and next steps. The initial action might simply be to procure additional information. For example, based on your funnel metrics (i.e., higher traffic, increasing PPC costs), monthly recurring revenue (MRR) should be increasing. But despite those increases, MRR is stable. The first step might be to investigate what’s happening:Are you targeting the wrong audience or a demographic not in a position to subscribe?Or is your copy not converting for some reason?It might take a few weeks, or even months, of testing and tweaking to get to the bottom of the issues. But without the variance analysis, knowing where to start could be impossible. Mathematically, variance analysis is quite simple; it’s just a little subtraction and maybe some percentages. However, your assessment of those differences can bring massive value. Start by looking at absolute differences, but don’t forget the importance of percentages. One essential aspect of meaningful analysis is building a budget baseline with the same structure as your actual reporting. This is simple in a system like Flightpath, while manual reporting can be a real challenge. Manually mapping accounts to P&L lines can be time-consuming and lead to errors. Let’s see what happened in an example company from January to July 2019.First up, look at the top-line revenue. We budgeted $3.9 million in sales and ended the year with $4.08 million. It’s not a massive overshoot, but a material improvement nonetheless. However, scrolling a bit further, we see that it’s not only revenue that ended up higher than budget. Cost of revenue is also up 9% vs. plan, while sales are only up 5%. Unfortunately, we’re spending too much on customer support compared to our initial expectations. Either we underestimated our cost of revenue, or something isn’t under control. Several issues could drive this deviation: Perhaps the customer onboarding experience isn’t as smooth as it should be. Maybe our staff hasn’t been efficiently solving customer problems. Can we train them better? Eliminate low-performing reps? Provide better standard operating procedures (SOPs)? Whatever the reason, this deviation is significant enough to warrant further investigation. Overall, gross profit is up by $118k (+4%), but the gross margin is down 1% vs. budget. Not bad, but not great either. Because of the higher level of support, we couldn’t convert all the additional revenue to margin. Next, let’s look at the rest of our expenses and how they impact the bottom line. 2019 G&A (general and administrative expenses) were roughly 9% or 44k above budget. While this isn’t an outstanding performance, it’s not a significant driver of our deviation vs. budget. The same is valid for R&D (I’m purposefully skipping S&M for now). At +1% vs. budget it’s only a minor deviation and we seem to have more significant problems.“Houston, we have a problem.”We have some significant gaps in sales and marketing (S&M), and missing the mark by $385k (26%) is massive compared to our other gaps. Determining the root causes here is where we’ll need to spend most of our time. Looking through the S&M subcategories, we spent 30% more on both advertising and payroll-marketing than planned.The big question to answer will be: Why did we spend so much more on S&M for so little return?The ratio isn’t visible in the view, but the return on S&M spend is actually below 0.5:1, meaning every additional dollar spent on sales and marketing generated only $0.50 in revenue. Perhaps this is a little oversimplified, but the issue is clear: We’re not converting additional sales to additional net income.Overall, driven mainly by our gap in S&M, our expenses were nearly half a million over plan. Combined with our slightly higher gross profit, we lost an additional $329k vs. budget.As a SaaS company, revenue and marketing are often the central levers for profitability. Once your product and development team is stable, more sales generally equal more profitability, and the caveat is that you can’t spend too much generating those sales. Keep in mind that the analysis isn’t only for research. Use this information to drive action to reassess our forecast and address the root cause of our overspending. When building a business, speed is essential. Quickly recognizing that you’re missing your targets allows rapid corrections to try something new.Dedicated tools like Flightpath allow for quick and easy creation of these variance analyses. The ability to drill down from high-level gaps to pinpoint exact areas of concern makes improvements easier. And a flexible dashboard means you can update what you track as you learn what areas of your business need more attention.Further integration with accounting systems like QuickBooks or Xero lets you automatically import data, create accurate and flexible forecasts, and make your variance analysis a breeze. Variance analysis is the fundamental link between the founding team’s vision and what’s happening in the real world. Data and systems are critical to providing this reporting rapidly. Time spent compiling data and building spreadsheets to compare your actual vs. budget doesn’t add value.With Flightpath, Baremetrics gives you the tools to perform rapid and meaningful budget vs. actual variance analysis for your growing SaaS business. These flexible financial planning tools let you prepare for what the future brings, no matter what.When you’re ready to get all of your business’s metrics and analysis in one place, import your financial and CRM data into Flightpath and book a free consultation with our SaaS experts at Baremetrics.\n"

      "6 Questions First-Time SaaS Founders Should be Asking Themselves.\n",
      "What do most first-time founders have in common?It has nothing to do with background, age, or business interests. Rather, it’s the mistakes they make in their first SaaS business.Luckily, we can avoid making the same mistakes by asking just a few crucial questions right from the start. This article will cover these questions, as well as other things to keep in mind while growing a SaaS business.Why do such a high percentage of SaaS start-ups fail?One of the main reasons is that many first-time founders create solutions in search of a problem. The demand for that particular service simply does not currently exist.That doesn’t mean that the demand will never exist. In some cases such as the smartphone, invention preceded demand. Once customers understood the product, demand boomed and that market corner actually became extremely lucrative.The issue with developing a new product category, however, is that it requires a long and expensive period of customer education.Most SaaS companies cannot afford to be pioneers.The best way to get bootstrapped quickly is to understand what gaps currently exist in the market, and develop products specifically to fill them.Here are key points to keep in mind for exploiting a gap in the market:The SaaS industry is in constant flux.While it’s only natural for your attention to be primarily on your own product, it’s important to look up periodically and watch what’s going on around you. You never want to be blindsided by the competition, or let yourself become overly vulnerable to sudden shifts in the market.Taking note of what’s happening in your space allows you to adapt to changes while there’s still time.Here are some signs of change to look out for in your market corner, and a few options on how to protect your growth:Good customer service is as much of a selling point for your company as your product itself. These days, customers expect round-the-clock support via email, social media, and telephone.One of the most common reasons for churn is customers feeling like they’re not getting the support they need.Here’s how to maintain effective communication with your customers:One of the most common frustrations expressed by customers is that the price structure of a product they’re considering is unclear.Here are some of the most common pricing mistakes SaaS companies make:SaaS companies operate almost exclusively online. Despite this fact, many of them fail to optimize their own web presence.Here are the key mistakes to avoid when building your SaaS’ online presence:Many first-time founders don’t know how to accurately track their company’s financial performance. Without data to inform key business decisions, they’re effectively taking a stab in the dark. Accurate metrics are essentially the roadmap to sustainable growth.Here’s what you need to know about metrics:We’re not just saying that because Baremetrics is the leading subscription analytics tool, it’s what our customers keep telling us. Baremetrics makes it easy to calculate metrics, understand performance, and make decisions with data-driven confidence.  \n",
      "A Founder’s Guide to SaaS Revenue Forecasting.\n",
      "Many companies stick with pretty basic financial systems when first getting off the ground. Once there's revenue coming in, the founder and their accountant may pull together a quick profit and loss statement (P&L) and make simple financial projections on a linear basis. And before substantial outside investment or really getting traction, that's probably sufficient. Anything more advanced is a nice-to-have, and only if there's somehow extra time. (But as we all know, there's never extra time!) Many founders similarly treat revenue forecasting as a luxury, making do with high-level sales projections during the initial phases of building a SaaS company.Until suddenly, revenue forecasting becomes a necessity. Then, to fuel the company's growth, you're trying to raise capital or get a loan. Or perhaps you're looking to lease a bigger office or grow your team.Any potential lender or investor will want to see a reliable revenue projection to gauge how likely you are to pay their money back (ideally at a large multiple). It's overwhelming to quickly pull together coherent numbers that reflect the realities and expectations of your business. This guide to SaaS revenue forecasting will walk you through building a revenue forecast and show you the benefits of using dedicated modeling tools. Forecasting is critical for any business, especially for an early-stage SaaS startup. But to build a good forecast, you first need to define where the company is going and how you plan to get there. Then, that forecast can serve as a powerful decision-making assistant, allowing you to peer into the future and ensure that the company is moving toward the correct destination. Revenue forecasting involves defining how much revenue you expect over a specific period, typically between one quarter and one year. This revenue forecast then feeds into the P&L and serves as the basis for your five-year projections.Remember that forecasting is more than just optimistic guessing about what's coming. A good forecast combines historical data and future assumptions with a bit of professional judgment. Even the most sophisticated revenue forecasting models nearly always rely on human input at one phase or another.In short, forecasting helps you and the rest of the team constantly answer the question: is what we're doing taking us where we want to go?Initially, it may be hard to convince yourself of the revenue forecast's value. Especially early on, when there's no finance team handling the details, you've already got a lot on your plate. You might assume that putting together a forecast takes time away from your 'real' business of:Building better products,Selling your software, andAnd hiring new developers.However, securing capital to invest in the business is part of the founder's job. It can be hard to get investors on board without reliable financial projections, or a model showing when the company will become cash-flow positive. And all serious financial projections, including your P&L and cash expectations, hinge on the revenue forecast. In SaaS, the revenue forecast drives decisions in many aspects of the company by ensuring you can answer critical questions like:How much can we afford to spend on marketing?Will we need more customer support staff?Is our funnel converting as many customers as it should?How much cash are we burning each month?When will we run out of runway? To forecast well, you'll need to understand the business's financial and marketing history and then adapt based on upcoming changes and expectations. It's not only the past that plays a crucial role, and a startup's internal plans can also have significant impacts.How quickly can you implement the new features customers are craving?When are the new sales managers starting?What options are available for driving more traffic?Can we improve conversion rates? You may assume your company's sales will continue increasing. But how can you be sure? Or will growth taper off, and you'll get stuck at a plateau?Don't linger too long in the analysis phase of finding the perfect modeling solution. Before implementing automated tools, it's generally helpful to begin revenue forecasting with a simple, accurate spreadsheet model. We prefer Google Sheets. And in fact, we've got a great template you can use. Just make a copy and follow along. One of the significant advantages of using a spreadsheet is that you're forced to do the work of mapping out the entire marketing funnel and sales process. Building the relationship between your CRM and financial reporting tools lets you see what factors have the most considerable impacts and where your biggest levers are. Then, after becoming familiar with what's driving your sales, you can consider moving on to more advanced tools.The most straightforward forecasting tools rely on the recent past to predict the future. The \"straight-line\" method uses historical revenue and growth trends to map high-level revenue expectations. Start with your last six months of data and map out the next six months based on your current trajectory. For example, if you had $50k in monthly recurring revenue six months ago and today you have $60k, a straight-line forecast would show that in 6 months, you'll hit $70k in MRR.A steady-growth projection is probably a very conservative estimate for a SaaS startup with solid growth. Although some fluctuation month-to-month is standard, simple linear growth is unlikely, especially if you’ve already got some traction.When your product has caught on, and the customer base is growing, shifting from a strictly linear model to a moving average calculation can drastically improve your forecast’s accuracy. At Baremetrics, we call this an Autopilot forecast. Instead of growing at a flat rate each month, your growth rate will change depending on the performance of the prior 3-6 months, eventually leveling out.This way, you’re not only capturing the growth rate of the past few months but also changes to revenue growth.Once you’re comfortable with the basics of revenue forecasting, it’s time to move on to a more complex revenue forecasting model. Now is when you’ll really get into the weeds to understand the basic building blocks of how your revenue comes together. As I said before, we’ve got an effective SaaS forecast template here that you can use as a basis. Like we did with a simple forecast, start by gathering as much relevant historical data as possible. If you’ve been in business for five years but have only seen traction over the last six to eight months, it’s okay to neglect the earlier info. Data from the first four years might not provide much insight into your future growth.In terms of relevant information, we’re not only after financial data but also marketing, sales, and other customer metrics. The “other” data is critical because it helps you anchor your model in what’s driving customer and revenue growth. Customers don’t magically appear. They generally start as visitors to your website and move through the different steps of your funnel. A handful will eventually convert and become paying customers - adding to your MRR.Ideally, set up the template so that you can directly paste an export from your financial system and CRM tools. Of course, our template is built to take actual figures from a Baremetrics export. Still, google sheets are pretty flexible, and you can quickly adapt your export or the input sheet to suit your specific needs.Start by mapping out your marketing funnel data and customer signup information. Historical data here will give you a picture of how your funnel works. How many visitors did you have to your website, and where did they come from? Do you get a lot of organic traffic, or is it mainly through ppc advertising, like AdWords?Of those visitors, how many signed up for your email list? Together, these figures give your visitor to signup conversion rate.Next you have your conversion rates from Signup -> MQL (marketing qualified lead), MQL -> SQL (sales qualified lead), and SQL -> Opportunities -> Trials. Finally, a certain percentage of those trials will indeed become new customers. You might be thinking: Hey, wait a minute! Why are we spending all this time on the marketing funnel? I thought we were building a revenue forecast!First things first, we’re getting there. Almost all new customers flow through your marketing funnel. Understanding each funnel step and conversion rate helps you see the complete process behind your revenue generation. Here’s where forecasting shifts from being something of a math exercise to more of an art. After mapping out your historical funnel data, analyze the formulas and how your conversion factors have moved over the past few months. Then, make your best guess what ratios are reasonable going forward. Our marketing funnel template’s conversion rates for Organic and AdWords traffic default to a 3-month moving average. This assumption provides an excellent basis for capturing the latest trends, but conversion rates can be sensitive to even minor adjustments at any funnel stage. Suppose improvement actions run on specific funnel aspects, or you know you’re about to release significant updates or fun new features. In that case, you might want to adjust some of the conversion factors manually.In this example, the forecast started in May 2020. You might notice that organic visitors are expected to continue shrinking -3.9% month over month. Also, because the standard formulas are based on the previous three months, as you project further and further into the future, the conversion metrics eventually level out.When planning AdWords (or any PPC) traffic, the number of visitors depends on the expected advertising budget and the cost per visitor. Here the assumption is that you can always buy more traffic and are limited only by your budget. This expectation further enforces the position that your revenue forecast affects what you can afford to spend on advertising. There’s a flywheel effect in the sense that more revenue growth drives more revenue growth, at least until you reach market saturation.The two marketing channels combine to give you the number of new customers your marketing funnel will generate each month. Revenue from these customers flows into your new MRR, where we’ll pick up the second part of your revenue forecast. Aside from attracting new customers, there are a few significant factors impacting MRR:Expansion and contraction (subscription upgrades or downgrades): This happens when existing customers decide to move to either a higher or lower pricing tier.Churn and reactivation: customers canceling subscriptions or reactivating a previously canceled subscription. You’ll see below that there is some churn, although we don’t have any reactivation in this example. Instead of using a moving average as we did previously with most of our conversion rates, these percentages are hard-coded to reflect our expectations for expansion, churn, and contraction. While tweaking conversion rates in your marketing funnel can significantly impact the number of monthly new customers, so can churn and reactivation impact MRR.  We’ve effectively established the total number of customers we expect each month from the marketing funnel to our expectations for expansion, churn, and contraction. Using these figures and the average revenue per customer (ARPC) for each category, we can make a solid prognosis for MRR.  Once you’ve established your revenue forecasting formulas and the data relationships necessary to build your forecast, it’s simply a matter of refreshing the data and assumptions each month. You’ll be able to copy your traffic and conversions data directly from your marketing funnel software. Then input your revenue and churn information. If your assumptions were way off, go ahead and reassess for the next forecast.That whole process shouldn’t take much time at all but can provide insight into what’s working and what isn’t. The real work involves assessing where you’re not on track with your previous assumptions, making decisions, and taking corrective actions.Revenue forecasting is essential, especially for SaaS businesses. Don’t wait until you’ve got an entire finance team ready or investors to satisfy to implement the most advanced cloud forecasting solutions. Getting started with a Google Sheets tool is massively better than not forecasting at all. However, the problem with relying on a flat spreadsheet model is that simplicity and accuracy often have a bit of an inverse relationship. In other words, it’s unlikely to be accurate if it’s simple. The other extreme applies too, if it’s accurate and you attempt to capture all of the different factors that drive your SaaS revenue, it’s probably not simple. And with spreadsheets, not simple can be both error-prone and challenging to maintain. Imagine the difficulty of regularly adding an additional marketing channel or a new service level and pricing tier to our simple example. It’s doable, but you’ll need to properly connect all the data points without double counting anything. Over the long term, companies with a broad customer base and complex product palette will become too much for a simple tool.Spreadsheet models have their place in the business world. Many great companies have been built using only spreadsheets for financial modeling. However, many effective alternatives are available to growing startups. A cloud solution like Flightpath can be extremely valuable for helping SaaS companies handle their forecasting and financial planning. It also integrates with financial software like Xero and QuickBooks to seamlessly import your actual data each month. With a one-stop forecasting tool, you’re able to do everything a spreadsheet can and more. It’s transparent and flexible, and updating is extremely easy. Forecasting and modeling serve several vital purposes. But those purposes mostly boil down to assisting internal decision-making and modeling financial trajectory to potential (and existing) stakeholders.Tools that help you spend less time to gain more insight can bring immense value. Imagine linking your forecasting tool directly to your financial reporting system. This would save you from importing data by hand or ensuring your formulas are correctly linked.Beyond that, tools like Flightpath can make visualizing multiple scenarios a breeze.Scenario modeling helps you prepare and position yourself for whatever life throws at your business. Periodically taking a little time to model several situations enables you to get ahead of the data to ensure you’re prepared for the worst but shooting for the best. Typically you’ll look at 2-3 main scenarios:The target scenario is what your team is aiming for. This “best-case” outcome shows what happens when you make aggressive assumptions and most things go right.The base case is more of a standard scenario. These revenue estimates are somewhat conservative and something that you can easily beat under normal circumstances. A good starting point for this “baseline” is your average performance over the past few months.In the worst case, you prepare for what to do when everything falls apart. This scenario involves modeling what happens in a coronavirus-like situation or if war should break out in areas where you have an extensive customer base, causing revenue to suddenly drop 20+%. Not likely, but also not impossible.The ability to instantly visualize all of the effects – including balance sheet and cash flow impacts – helps to make sure the entire team understands the impacts of each scenario.One of the other significant advantages of using a modeling tool is the modular way you can work. Unlike a spreadsheet model, a modular tool allows you to add new components to your forecasts without rebuilding the entire model. In Flightpath, you can quickly drop in exports from your accounting tools or downloads from your customer metrics software and adapt your model. The same applies to adding a new scenario or even new products and marketing channels.In the long run, this can save a lot of time AND ensure your model isn’t unintentionally excluding critical data. The level of sophistication necessary for your financial tools depends on the purpose of the forecast and the target audience. If your primary objective behind building a forecast is to simply get better control over your business, the Google Sheets model you started with might cover your bases for a while. However, creating and updating it might be a manual process, where you might risk making severe errors in assumptions or calculations.Because you know there’s actual data behind the spreadsheet projections, you can feel comfortable showing them to potential investors or loan underwriters. However, suppose you’re trying to convince VC investors or a bank that your SaaS business has a solid upward trajectory. Then, it might be time to invest in switching from spreadsheets to an automated modeling and reporting tool like Flightpath.After the initial setup is complete, you’ll be able to automate some of the running and reporting of your business. With Flightpath, Baremetrics gives you the tools to build a great revenue forecasting model for your growing SaaS business. The flexible financial planning tools let you model what the future brings, no matter what.When you’re ready to get all of your business’s metrics in one place, import your financial and CRM data into Flightpath and book a free consultation with our SaaS experts at Baremetrics.\n"

      "The Anatomy of a Modern SaaS Site’s Homepage.\n",
      "A well-designed website is more than just a collection of appealing pages that do a good enough job of representing your SaaS business. A great site is also the key element for reaching your target audience, securing leads, boosting conversions, and retaining existing customers. In other words, a functional, attractive, user-friendly website plays a significant role in helping your SaaS business grow.And even if you, personally, don't really care much about aesthetics, there's plenty of data proving that you should care about how your SaaS site's homepage looks and performs. Fortunately, there are several improvements you can make to bring your website up to today's standards so that it's able to contribute to the growth of your business. So, if you're ready to roll up your sleeves and make some changes, here are all the elements you need on a modern SaaS site's homepage.If first impressions matter so much in driving trust and conversions, then it should be no surprise that the area of your website deserving most of your attention is the hero section of the homepage.Data shows that the first screenful is where web visitors spend most of their time – 57% of their viewing time, to be more precise. By optimizing the elements in this area, you can effectively address the pain points of your potential customers and convince them that your products offer the exact solutions and benefits they need.But here's the catch: most SaaS homepages go straight into describing the software features they offer. And, sure, this can be a solid strategy when looking to differentiate themselves from the competition. Nonetheless, it can also result in the alienation of their target audience, who might feel disconnected from brands whose sole focus is on themselves.Luckily, there's an easy fix: creating a customer-centric value proposition.By finding ways to describe your products from your audience's point of view, you can:Effectively grab web visitors' interest (minimizing bounce rates).Show potential customers what they stand to gain (and move them to the lower stages of the funnel).Prove that your solutions deliver meaningful benefits, therefore boosting the likelihood of new leads signing up for a free trial.In addition to the unique value proposition you place in the hero section of your homepage, you'll find that the main call to action also plays a significant part in securing conversions. However, as you focus on optimizing your website for success, you should remember that most website visitors don't convert on their first visit.In fact, some resources suggest that it takes between six and eight touches before a prospect turns into a customer.So, what can you do to stop first-time web visitors from navigating away from your pages without having captured them as leads? One option would be to create low-commitment CTAs that don't invite people to sign up for a trial or become paid subscribers but rather aid you in moving people down the sales funnel.For a great example of how you can do this, check out the Quetext homepage. Instead of inviting people to immediately sign up for the free (or paid) versions of its software solution, this SaaS brand understands the importance of having prospects evaluate its core product. So, it employs a CTA that encourages them to do just that – no fees, no commitments, and most importantly, no risks involved.Alternatively, if you don't offer product previews, you could do what Mighty Networks does and encourage first-time visitors to watch a demo. This is another excellent strategy for introducing software benefits and features without forcing prospects to take on a risk they're not yet ready for.If you want to build a modern SaaS homepage, you have to be prepared to use video. And that's not just because video content is growing in popularity but also because research shows it's one of the absolute best ways to introduce your products.According to Wyzowl's latest survey reports, as many as 73% of customers prefer to watch short videos to learn about a product or service. Add to this the fact that 78% of people say they've been convinced to subscribe to a SaaS product by watching a video, and it becomes clear that explainers should definitely be a prominent feature of your homepage.There are a few rules you should aim to follow if you want your investment to pay off when utilizing explainer videos for SaaS growth.A case study from Breadnbeyond found that the ideal run time for explainers was between 60 and 120 seconds, with viewers' attention rates sharply dropping after the 2-minute mark.So, if you're planning to add this type of media to your website, ensure that you're keeping it short, simple, and approachable. Yes, there is always a lot to say when you're introducing the features of a complex software product. But chances are, your audience is only prepared to give you a small amount of their time, so get to the point and leave the details for your site's features section.For an excellent example of a SaaS brand making full use of a 120-second explainer video, check out the one on the Optimal Workshop website. It's a super-time-efficient description of a complex product. And one could even say that the video helps the brand create a market for its products, seeing that many of Optimal Workshop's target audience still don't know the positive impact user research could have on their business results.To see tangible benefits from adding an explainer video to your homepage, it has to be a proper reflection of your brand. This means that both the visuals and the voice you use have to communicate your brand's mission, vision, and values, and they have to appeal to your target audience. For example, BambooHR is a SaaS business building its reputation as an approachable HR solution that knows the ups and downs of dealing with employee management. This is why its explainer video starts off by offering an unfiltered peek into HR, showing the exact situations the program aims to solve and proving that the brand truly understands its audience and their unique pain points.Finally, for an explainer video to effectively convert website visitors, it must be well-positioned on your homepage.Ideally, give it a spot above the scroll-line, as this is where visitors will spend most of their browsing time anyway. Moreover, don't make it cumbersome for web visitors to play the video. Ensure that the user experience is exceptional – something you can achieve by hosting your explainer on Wistia.Lastly, to guarantee that your explainer videos actually deliver results, don't forget to end them with a call to action, as done by Officevibe below.The next element of a modern SaaS homepage is visual content.Essentially, today's buyers aren't that big on reading. Research shows that most users skim text online instead of reading it. And eye-tracking data from MOZ proves that images outperform text, even when they're not positioned in primary spots on these pages.With this in mind, your SaaS homepage needs to utilize visuals to elevate the user experience and effectively present your products.Screenshots, for example, are a great way to illustrate features, give insights into what your software can do, and manage potential subscribers' expectations regarding what they can expect. You can also use them to help people determine whether your product is capable of solving their pain points and whether it possesses the functionalities they require.Notion does an exceptional job of using visuals to offer sneak peeks into its service, seeing that it doesn't just add screenshots to its site but elevates them to GIFs. By taking this course of action, the brand effectively shows what the product looks like and illustrates several use cases that would otherwise require entire blocks of text to describe.Another superb strategy for convincing website visitors to consider investing in your product is adding social proof to your homepage.Showcasing ratings, reviews, testimonials, and user stories is an excellent way to persuade potential customers to subscribe to your service. Especially seeing that 88% of people rank word-of-mouth advertising as the most-trustworthy format and that 50% more people trust recommendations than paid ads.However, the best type of social proof for your homepage entirely depends on your target audience.For example, if you're trying to convert risk-averse buyers (like businesses), you will want to go with high-quality social proof. Even if it means sacrificing quantity. For inspiration, check out the Baremetrics Customers page. As you can see, it describes the challenges users managed to solve by implementing our solution and offers ideas for those looking to get more out of their investment.Alternatively, if you're a B2C business looking to take social proof to the next level, you could check out Bay Alarm Medical. This brand chose to utilize a floating Google Rating widget in the lower-left corner of its homepage. But, what stands out in this example is that the rating widget is always visible – no matter how far down web visitors scroll. Bay Alarm Medical also includes additional testimonials on its homepage – the NBC Today video stands out in particular. What makes the whole thing effective at getting buyers to convert is that every single iteration of social proof on the brand's website is chosen to appeal to its target audience – the elderly and their caretakers, who want extra security for their loved ones.Whatever your goal – capturing more leads, boosting retention, improving customer lifetime value, or simply enhancing the customer experience – your homepage must offer convenient ways for web visitors to get in touch with you.Research from SuperOffice shows that only very few people believe they're on the receiving end of exceptional service. And according to the same survey, for brands to offer exceptional customer experience, they must deliver fast response times, consistency across channels, knowledgeable staff, multiple contact points, and easy-to-use tools for service.The best part about this data? It shows how many of these requirements can be solved by adding more contact options to your site.Yes, expanding your contact points will mean spending some money hiring more employees or developing AI-driven chatbot solutions that can aid your potential customers. But, it will also mean boosting your brand's credibility and helping customers see it as a reliable solution to their needs.There are several beautiful and user-oriented ways to do this. For example, you might draw inspiration from ServiceNow and add a floating Contact card web visitors can use to get in touch via email. You might go the traditional route and reserve your footer for multiple contact options. Or, you might choose a solution such as Intercom and create a customer communication solution that helps your business convert new customers, engage web visitors, and support existing users to drive next-level results.While sometimes, the key to growing your brand with the aid of homepage features includes adding new elements, other times, the solution is to take some things away.The latter can be especially true with product descriptions.On modern SaaS websites, your copywriting should always aim for simplicity. And there are several reasons an accessibility-first approach works:We've already mentioned that web users don't read online text. Instead, they skim in one of several common reading patterns, which means that the best way to communicate high-value information is through attention-grabbing headers, visuals, and bullet points.The higher the readability of a page, the greater its chances of securing a conversion. In fact, for its 2022 Conversion Benchmark Report, Unbounce measured how readability and word count impacted conversion rates on SaaS and concluded that shorter and more understandable product descriptions simply performed better than their counterparts.Finally, don't forget that the key to capturing your target audience's attention is to write in a voice and tone appealing to them. So, if your SaaS product is targeted at casual users, don't blow your chances of selling it by trying to sound impressive with sophisticated jargon or in-depth technical details.The great thing is that there are multiple proven-to-work tricks to ensure your homepage copy is engaging and convincing.For example, if you take a quick look at the Ultimate Meal Plans homepage, you'll see that the brand employs a simplified communication method for explaining what its product does. By breaking the entire process into three stages, using illustrations, and limiting each copy section to just a couple of sentences, Ultimate Meal Plans effectively describes its service while keeping its audience highly engaged and preventing them from becoming overwhelmed.If you operate in a niche where your audience is likely to be a bit more technically savvy, you can allow yourself to go into additional detail.Skubana is an ecommerce inventory and order management platform for multichannel ecommerce. In other words, it's a B2B organization that knows its potential clients are already experienced in online sales. With this in mind, Skubana's homepage copy doesn't shy away from using niche terms and industry-specific phrases. On the contrary, it employs abbreviations, addresses KPIs, and gets straight to the point. And it even goes so far to avoid wasting web visitors' time that it addresses the possibility of its potential clients being bored of reading SaaS pitches, inviting them to book a demo instead.Lastly, as you explore ways to bring your SaaS site's homepage up to today's standards, don't forget that one of the best ways to show your authority on relevant topics is to employ a well-planned content marketing strategy. And, to secure the highest possible ROI from the content you publish, it's not a bad idea to feature your prestige blog posts on your homepage.The absolute best thing about this course of action is that linking to your blog posts from your homepage is super simple. At the same time, it shows leads that you understand their pain points, that you're willing to take the time to answer their questions, and that your brand cares about them getting value out of their subscription. For an excellent example of a SaaS business that employs this tactic to boost brand image and nudge web visitors down the sales funnel, check out Miro. As you can see, this brand's homepage features a Remote work resources section where visitors can read guides, FAQs, and even access webinars.Alternatively, you may experiment with automated content features, as seen on the Attentive homepage. But, remember, this approach might not always work as the content linked may not include your most valuable published pieces.There you have it, the anatomy of a modern SaaS site's homepage.As you can see, the elements you need to include on the primary page of your website aren't that complicated. Everything you need to do to optimize for growth is to understand your audience's pain points, eliminate risk, use different content types and formats to prove your brand's trustworthiness and authority, and commit to being there for your customers when they need you.Of course, to ensure the best outcomes, you will have to measure and analyze your website's performance and how it impacts your business metrics like MRR, LTV, ARPU, and more. So don't forget to start your free trial of Baremetrics to gain the insights you need in order to take your business to the next level.\n"

      "Innovating Responsibly: How to Future-proof Your SaaS Startup.\n",
      "This article shares key insights from our Founder Chats interview with Aran Khanna on April 5th, 2022. Listen to the full conversation here.The journey to product development starts with a problem.    This problem is one faced by your ideal users. In other words, it’s a problem that they would pay to have resolved.In the SaaS space, these product solutions often incorporate innovative technologies that haven’t been extensively tested yet.Over the last decade, the barrier to entry for launching a SaaS start-up has lowered significantly. Early-stage founders have more resources than ever at their disposal, notably access to knowledge and skill-building across subjects, non-traditional funding routes, and an asynchronous, global workforce powered by remote work tools and freelancing platforms such as Upwork.Naturally, this highly competitive market is a rapidly evolving environment. In order to stay relevant, product development has to respond to fast changes in the tech space. Aside from the need to maintain an edge over the competition, a lot of the rapid changes in the SaaS space are fueled by the fact that SaaS solutions are engineered to be interdependent. Many product components are either built on top of open source applications and other external technologies (such as Shopify), or require cross-platform integration with compatible services (such as Stripe) to be optimally useful to their users. This requires all software components essentially to keep up with each other’s product updates.On the one hand, these market dynamics create a lot of interesting (and lucrative) opportunities for developers.There is, however, a significant issue with this need for speed in the tech space: there is little incentive for companies to consider the long-term implications that their innovative technologies could have once released into the wild.These dynamics also disincentivize putting societal needs above the company bottom line.The concept of future-proofing usually refers to the process of anticipating market events and technological developments that could affect your business, and creating protocols to minimize that negative impact.In this context, it also applies to the opposite force: the unintended ramifications your product could have on the world upon release.Why should you allocate resources towards thinking about potential collateral damage?First of all, there’s the ‘it’s the right thing to do’ argument. If you’re developing a product to help people, you should also be thinking about how that product could cause harm – once released, that technology is out there to be used or misused as others see fit.Secondly, depending on where you are, you may be legally liable for misuse of your product, especially if it can be demonstrated that your company acted irresponsibly.Finally, it’s the smart business move.Users these days are more than happy to cancel their subscriptions to companies they feel are not acting in society’s best interest, and social media platforms have made it easier than ever to rally support for boycott movements.Naming no names, this happened recently to a large media conglomerate. Accusations of irresponsible and malicious usage of user data absolutely tanked the share value of this company.So the real question is, can you afford to not think about the future? The key aspects to future-proofing product development are intent, research, and contingency planning.Here are 3 tips on how to innovate responsibly. As a conscientious founder, starting out with good intentions and making sure you’re serving the best interests of your customers is hopefully a given.Maintaining that intent throughout various stages of development is often the hard part.“I think with early stage entrepreneurship - and, you know, I credit my time at Amazon for really solidifying this in my mind as a formal process - always work backwards from your end user and your customer. Make sure that what you are building, how you're thinking about building it, is aligned with their best interests. You're always working backwards from them, not working backwards from what competitors are doing or revenue maximization even, but working backwards from the customer. Across all the projects I've done, that's always been a winning strategy and that's always been something that's worth taking the time to do.” – Aran Khanna, ArcheraThere are 3 common pitfalls that lead many companies to stray from their original intent:Financial incentives to ‘sell out’Fiduciary duties - having a legal responsibility to maximize profit to serve the financial interests of investors, equity partners, and shareholders Conflict of interest between obligations to different types of usersThe last one is an interesting case, and is far more common than you might think.With regards to the aforementioned media platform that’s recently fallen into public disfavor, Aran notes, “they view customers as their advertising partners and they view users as cattle. And I think that's sort of the fundamental problem.”In 1973, Richard Serra famously commented, “if something is free, you’re the product”.The truth is, it’s not just free-to-use social media and communication platforms that sell user data; many paid services similarly double-cross their main customer base and sell or share private information with advertisers, business partners, and to commercial user databases.The takeaway:If your business caters to different groups of people (whether users or other interested parties) whose interests either don’t align, or are in actual conflict, be prepared to walk a very fine line.That brings us to informed consent: you should always be transparent with your users about how their data will be used, provide them with easily accessible options to change their settings, and notify them about any changes to your terms. When you’re in the midst of creating an amazing new tool, it can be very easy to overlook how on the flipside, it could have a negative impact too.Physical product design for, say, home electronics or a motor vehicle has a given set guidelines for testing the safety of that product. These tend to be industry-standard, and state or country-mandated.SaaS products are in a different boat: because so much of the techin this space is new, those standard guidelines either don’t exist, or are still playing catch up with the most recent developments.Individual companies not only bear the responsibility of testing their own products, for the greater part they also need to come up with their own sets of guidelines that they deem appropriate.With a pressure to release products quickly, however, there’s a strong incentive to skip the research and go straight to release. This approach can lead to dire consequences.“[…] In a lot of these engineering environments, it's about shipping the thing. It's about getting it out the door, getting minimum viable. And I think as we get into these more complex applications, and especially applications at scale, minimum viable just isn't a sufficient bar to clear. So just getting people to understand, hey, we want to understand, we need to get to a place in which we have confidence. Not just a minimum viable product, but you know, minimum viable confidence that this is going to have a net positive outcome and we've thought deeply about the known knowns and known unknowns that could cause negative outcomes here, and we have a plan in place to address those.’’ – Aran Khanna, ArcheraHow do you go about brainstorming what potential outcomes your product innovation could lead to?Aran shares his process:“The first thing is just to have the exercise where you go and think about it as a team. And the other thing is just talk to experts in the field, because a lot of start-ups are running into fields where they have probably less context than the experts, but what's beautiful about the world today is you can, I think with two or three phone calls, get in touch with almost anyone, you know, given the right network and things like that.And so talking to folks who are experts in the field who have done a lot of trial and error work and trying to learn from them, I think is another step that folks should just take in terms of breaking into a more regulated space, or breaking into a space where there is some risk on the downside of deployment of a new technology that you're trying to develop.’’ Once a new technology is released, the cat is out of the bag. What the creators first intended with an innovative product ceases to matter, because within a short amount of time, that technology will become available to anyone. It can be used, misused, and built upon, by just about anyone.“How bad could it be?”Glad you asked. Did you know TNT was actually invented to be used as a yellow dye before someone else realized it could be used to blow things up?Or in the tech world, the ‘internet of things’ concept of having smart appliances actually led to mass spamming, hacking, and leaked footage from in-home cameras.Even a tool as innocent as Google Earth has been misused for nefarious purposes.That’s why it’s essential to ask the right questions before release; cleaning up after the fact is not only ineffective, it’s expensive, and highly damaging to brand reputation.Protect your users, protect yourself.A big thank you to Aran Khanna from Archera for sharing his insight into responsible innovation.

      "5 Mistakes to Avoid When Tracking SaaS Metrics.\n",
      "You run a SaaS business, which means you probably have metrics coming out the wazoo. The question is, do you know what to do with all of that information?Tracking SaaS metrics often feels like drinking from a firehose. Because of this, it can be difficult to discern what the data is telling you. This leads to a myriad of potential pitfalls.We'd like to help you avoid these mistakes, if at all possible. So keep reading to learn why tracking SaaS metrics is so important (even if analyzing the data makes your head spin) and five mistakes to avoid while doing so.Note: This article is based on a webinar we hosted with our friends, Future of SaaS. It’s called \"Turning Metrics Into Money\" and you can watch the entire event here.We get it, tracking SaaS metrics sounds like a pain. Especially when you have a mountain of other tasks to do. But it's absolutely essential to the success of your business.Tracking SaaS metrics will allow you to gauge your company's progress. Are you on track to reach your goals? You won't know until you look at your metrics. It will also help you identify potential issues in your business and remove them before they become massive problems.Finally, tracking SaaS metrics will help you make better decisions and enable your company to grow at a faster rate. At the end of the day, that's what every SaaS business owner wants.Can we agree that tracking SaaS metrics is important? Great, now let's talk about mistakes to avoid during the tracking process. Do your best to circumvent these five pitfalls.Most founders want to track everything when it comes to SaaS metrics.We understand the impulse. Knowledge is power. The more data you have, the better decisions you'll make, right? Not necessarily…Oftentimes, an ocean of data makes it harder to analyze SaaS metrics.You'll get swept up in a tsunami of information and you won't be able to determine what's most important. Instead, we recommend taking a step back and analyzing a few metrics only. Then diving deeper into said metrics to really understand what the data is telling you.For example, instead of just measuring your company's churn rate, segment your customers to see which segments are churning most frequently.You may find that, while your overall churn rate is higher than you'd like it to be, most of your churned customers fall outside of your ideal customer profile. With this knowledge, you can adjust your marketing and sales efforts and target higher quality leads.\"Great,\" you're thinking, \"Analyze less metrics—I can do that! But how do I choose which metrics to focus on? There are a lot of them… Which should I pay attention to?\"New SaaS companies should focus on the pirate metrics, so named because the acronym for these metrics is AARRR, as in, \"Arr, Matey, time to walk the plank!\"So, grab your eye patch and three corner hat; here's the nitty gritty on pirate metrics:For a complete and thorough breakdown of the pirate framework, read this blog post.AARRR metrics work for most SaaS companies. But before you dive in, make sure you consider your business model. Are these metrics really the best ones for your offerings?If not, find a different set of metrics that's better suited to your situation.Always remember, you're running a SaaS business, which is different from, say, a traditional widget-selling business. As such, you need to track and analyze different metrics.If your local grocery store, for example, were to track company metrics, they'd probably focus on things like amount of foot traffic, average transaction value, and typical inventory turnover. SaaS businesses, though, should focus on metrics that evaluate recurring revenue including Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), churn rate, and customer lifetime value.Always consider your business model when tracking and assessing your metrics.You need to consider your level of investment when choosing SaaS metrics, too.If you're a bootstrapped company, you need to become profitable as soon as possible. Why? Because you don't have a pile of cash in the bank to fall back on. If you don't start making money almost immediately, your business will never get off the ground.If you have a bevy of investors, on the other hand, near-future profitability is less of a concern. You have time and resources to experiment with different ideas and strategies.What does this look like in real life?Well, bootstrapped businesses will want to focus on metrics that deal with cash flow—customer acquisition costs, customer lifetime value, and MRR are good examples.Investor-backed businesses, though, will probably focus more on growth-related metrics, such as cost per lead, activation rate, and net promoter score.This doesn't mean that, as a bootstrapped business, you can't keep your eye on growth-related metrics. We suggest that you do! (How else are you going to build the next Salesforce or Adobe or Shopify?) But growth-related metrics shouldn't be your first priority.Do you know the difference between quantitative and qualitative metrics? If not, no worries. Here's a quick definition of each—just to make sure we're on the same page.Here's an easy way to distinguish quantitative from qualitative metrics: quantitative metrics tell you what's happening, while qualitative metrics tell you why it happened.Now, it's really easy to focus all of your attention on quantitative metrics. After all, they represent facts and aren't tainted by opinion. But this is a mistake.Consider this example: Awesome SaaS Company Incorporated, ASCI for short, sells a variety of SaaS products in the financial services space. Unfortunately, the company has had a hard time retaining customers in recent months, as evidenced by its 15% churn rate.ASCI's leadership team can look at quantitative metrics and realize that they must make a change to boost customer retention. But what change should they make? Quantitative metrics don't have the answer. Fortunately, qualitative metrics just might.ACSI's top brass starts reading through customer reviews and feedback from cancellation surveys. This helps them realize that they aren’t onboarding new customers very well. As a result, customers aren’t getting value out of their products and choose to find other solutions.By changing their approach to customer onboarding, ASCI hopes to improve its customer retention rate.Here's the point: both quantitative and qualitative metrics are important. But qualitative metrics tend to be underappreciated. Stop focusing solely on quantitative metrics and give qualitative metrics their due—you'll be glad you did.We're just going to come out and say it: customer segmentation is super important.Many SaaS companies serve a variety of different customers. Examples of customer segments include small businesses, medium-size businesses, and enterprise businesses. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is analyzing these three segments in the same way.Small businesses have different needs, resources, and expectations than their enterprise-level counterparts. Because of this, your small business customers will behave in very different ways than your enterprise customers and deserve to be treated differently.If you sell multiple SaaS products, you can segment your customers by product, too. Every company that subscribes to Product A, for example, goes into segment one, while companies that subscribe to Product B go into segment two, etc.By segmenting your customers, you'll get a clear picture of your business.You may find, for instance, that your small business customers are churning at a higher rate than your enterprise customers. You can then devise a strategy that will help you retain more of your small business customers without affecting your enterprise customers in any way.Tracking SaaS metrics is essential. Doing so will help you learn about your customers, minimize problems before they become major issues, and grow your company faster than ever before. Here's the catch: it's not always easy to do.Many SaaS leaders make the mistake of tracking too many metrics. Or focusing solely on quantitative metrics. Or any of the other five mistakes we outlined above.Fortunately, after reading this article, you know which pitfalls to look out for. All you need now is a simple way to track and analyze metrics for your company. Once again, we have a suggestion: invest in Baremetrics, a popular analytics and reporting solution for SaaS businesses.Baremetrics will give you the power to track 26 different metrics and visualize them in ways that make each easy to understand.Think Baremetrics might work for you?

      "7 Tips on Improving Employee Retention as a Remote-Work SaaS Business.\n",
      "Inspired by Founder Chats: Justin Cooke from Empire Flippers. This article shares key insights from our interview with Justin Cooke on January 6th, 2022. Listen to the full conversation here. Justin is the Founder and CMO of Empire Flippers, host of the Empire Flippers podcast, and brand ambassador of the company. From content to paid traffic, he keeps the sales staff busy and the lead funnels full. He lives on the road with his wife and is regularly traveling through SE Asia, Europe, and the US. Would love to catch a beer (or two) the next time he’s in your city.It’s 2022, or for most of the world, year three of the remote-work era.In the SaaS industry, many of us haven’t stepped into an office, donned a full suit (dress shirt and sweatpants in Zoom meetings, anyone?), nor spoken to our teams in person for years now.That kind of distance can create a strong sense of disconnect, which is why for companies, implementing strategies to keep staff motivated is more important than ever.As a founder, keeping your team happy isn’t just about maintaining a pleasant work environment. High employee retention and good team morale underpin productivity, boost business growth, and even improve the experiences of your customers. Many tech moguls such as Google or Apple invest heavily into employee satisfaction for exactly this reason.But how do you build team cohesion when most of your staff aren’t in the same city, let alone the same continent or timezone?Last week we spoke to Justin Cooke, Founder and COO of Empire Flippers, who shared invaluable insights into successfully managing an international, fully remote team.A good manager values the different skill sets and interests of each employee, and understands how to best put these to use in a team setting. Treating employees not just as tools for your company, but as real people with their own career development goals, goes a long way towards earning your team’s trust, respect, and loyalty.This begins with hiring.If you have a specific role to fill, you might be tempted to simply hire the person with the most relevant experience on their CV. In a smaller company, however, it’s important to onboard staff who will both work well with your existing team, as well as bring new skills and perspectives to the table.Working remotely doesn’t eliminate friction in communication; in many ways, it can actually amplify it. Justin mentions that for this reason, he prefers to hire people with some experience working face-to-face in an office, as those teamwork skills translate to an all-remote workspace, too.As a founder, knowledge of your team must also include a strong awareness of self, notably your own strengths and limitations.Being able to delegate tasks to trusted team members is critical to the long-term health of both yourself and your company. With regards to sharing tasks, Justin says,‘’I think it's fun to work out projects, test projects, see if they fail, see if they stick, but the long-term improvement of them, and tweaking of them, making them better… it's just, it's not fun for me.I'm much more on the creative side of things. And so I like to work on projects that are fun for me. I know it sounds silly, but that's how I operate best. And so when it comes to tweaking them, or getting 20% improvements like that, I'm not terribly interested. That’s an area where my business partner is really strong.’’What can you give your employees to increase their job satisfaction?More money? Sure, bonuses and commissions are a great short-term boost of morale. But longer term, what employees actually need to be successful long-term is good support structures. Here’s what Justin had to say:‘’What we realized over time is that giving away the farm to people wasn't actually helping. It would have been better for us to give them a more supportive structure, and take more of the [  ] fees for ourselves, meaning giving them leads, giving them support, giving them a team that they can work with and then giving them much smaller commissions.  That's a better model for a business than to just give away a whole bunch and hope. You're going to draw people over to do business with you, but we didn’t know that [at first].’’Paying employees well above market rate has two additional drawbacks. Firstly, this strategy is rarely sustainable for most SaaS companies, and those resources could be re-invested in the company to fast-track growth instead. Secondly, high individual bonuses can actually cause rifts within teams, as well as incentivize short-sighted sales strategies in order to hit those quarterly targets.The best way to provide for your employees isn’t handing out cash - it’s making sure that they have the resources they need to perform well, notably manpower, budget, and communication channels.In many SaaS companies, the sales team competes for bonuses. While this ‘healthy competition’ strategy can boost sales, those sales often come at the price of a collaborative work environment.That isn’t to say that bonuses on the whole are bad! Justin found that offering team-wide commissions based on total revenue yielded the best results:‘’We decided to build a collaborative team that could work together [...] People would look to list their business with us, and the whole team would be working on it. Didn't matter whether you had one salesperson, let's say that salesperson got sick for a week. Another person would be happy to step in. And the reason is, they weren't making a commission on an individual deal. It was a company-wide bonus [...] And so that made a much more collaborative sales team rather than a individual competitive team.’’Incentives create priorities. If you incentivize one action, other tasks will inevitably become deprioritized.Most incentive structures created around sales bonuses result in staff focusing almost exclusively on the short-term, notably closing deals this month or this quarter. Those regular sales are important for growth, but if they come at the expense of creating infrastructure for the future, your business can shoot itself in the foot in the longer term.So how do you create incentives for employees to invest their time into a more distant future?One solution is offering partial ownership over the business’ long-term success.Should you offer equity to your key employees? This is a widely debated question in SaaS spaces.Let’s take a look at the ‘pros’.Owning equity is an extremely strong incentive for employees to act in the company’s best interest. This includes working on long-term improvements in infrastructure, growth strategies that take years to fully pay off, and minimizing expenses.Justin says that in his experience,‘’If they [employees] have some equity stake in it, long-term, that's where they're going to get more aligned with the founders, because they're going to see the 2, 3, 4, 5-year horizon that you do. And they're going to get some compensation based on that [...]. They're also not going to totally sell out for short-term profits because they have that long-term equity incentive.’’Of course, there are drawbacks to using equity as a tool for promoting employee retention, notably the dilution of ownership, loss of financial privacy, and an increased pressure to sell from employees who will want to see their cut one day. Another means of boosting employee retention and maintaining engagement is to create an open dialogue surrounding the company’s goals.If your company is small enough, consider hosting quarterly strategy meetings for all departments to come together and discuss their developments. Each team should have a broad idea of what other teams are working towards and why. Some of the biggest demotivators for employees are being kept in the dark about key company decisions, sensing a lack of direction, and feeling undervalued.Sharing goals in open strategy meetings is a great step towards avoiding these pitfalls.Justin also emphasizes the importance of adapting company targets to your team’s capacity and resources:‘’We've always done a top-down approach to sales saying, okay, here's what we want to hit, and here's what it will take to get to that number. Here's what we think we need to get to. And we're taking more of a bottoms-up approach to goal setting now, where we're looking at, okay, our salespeople can deliver this much per person. We can add this many salespeople this year, we're going to get to this dollar amount.’’Strategy meetings are also an invaluable platform for establishing what goals are achievable for your team, and what can be done to increase those targets over time.Promoting employee retention is absolutely a two-way street; building team cohesion requires companies to invest both their time and money.Bringing the team together for company meetups is even more important when your staff works remotely. According to Justin, SaaS industries tend to cultivate high-stress environments; organizing some fun activities together is ‘’really great for when you're apart and you're in those stressful situations to remember who you're working with and who's on the other side of the zoom call.’’A big thank you to Justin Cooke from Empire Flippers for sharing these 7 tips on how to promote employee retention in a remote-work SaaS company.

      "Sync with Connex Recovered $11K in Failed Payments in 1 Month with Baremetrics.\n",
      "SYNC WITH CONNEX’S CHALLENGE Sync with Connex is a successful, multi-million dollar SaaS company. To support growth goals, they needed to track data from Stripe, recover failed credit card payments, and optimize their cancellation flow. SOLUTIONThey started a free trial of Baremetrics. Right away, the Baremetrics toolkit gave actionable insights about their Stripe data, automated their dunning campaign, and provided a process for collecting actionable feedback. RESULTSWithin just one month of using Baremetrics, Sync with Connex has recovered $11,000 in failed payments and reduced billing-related support tickets by 20%.Sync with Connex is a 3rd party integration tool that automates data entry between QuickBooks and e-commerce channels, payment processors, and shipping solutions. Since launching in 2010, Sync with Connex has helped over 5,000 businesses simplify their workflows, prevent input errors, and repurpose precious time for more important tasks. Sync with Connex offers two products: Connex Desktop (for people using the desktop version of QuickBooks), and Connex Online (for people using the cloud-based version of QuickBooks). Both versions allow business owners to integrate with over 25 e-commerce solutions such as Amazon, ShipStation, eBay, and more, and put data entry on auto-pilot. With over 14 years of experience in the e-commerce and SaaS industries, Sync with Connex is an indispensable tool for growing e-commerce companies. Baremetrics spoke with Sync with Connex Founder and CEO Joseph Anderson to learn more about how they use Baremetrics to analyze Stripe data, recover thousands of dollars in failed payments, and learn why customers cancel to reduce churn.Simply put, manual data entry stinks. It’s tedious, prone to human error, and takes tons of hours to do accurately. In fact, a 2020 international study found that it’s one of the most redundant and hated workplace tasks. Despite this, many companies still rely on manual data entry to ensure information is shared between the right channels, including Joseph’s former employer. The company even hired an intern to type 100 orders a day into QuickBooks, despite employing over a hundred software developers.For Joseph, the situation was inspiring.“I thought, couldn’t one of them write software to automatically sync orders into QuickBooks?”Joseph Anderson soon left the company to start what would later become Sync with Connex in January 2010. His mission was to make QuickBooks simpler to integrate with other software, and completely automate data entry for online e-commerce businesses. After all, growing companies can’t reach their full potential if they’re wasting time and money plugging numbers into several different spreadsheets.For SaaS products, building, improving, and maintaining software is one thing. Running a company is another. After years of steady growth, Sync with Connex would run into challenges that would ultimately change the way they operated as a business. Sync with Connex not only helped their customers do better data entry into QuickBooks, but they had to consider operational issues that included how  to best collect revenue from their own customers. When Sync with Connex launched in January 2012, they started using PalPal to process their customers’ payments. Stripe, Recurly, and Chargebee were all fairly new products, and the PayPal platform allowed Sync with Connex to easily do what they needed to do: process payments from customers.But aside from processing payments, PayPal offered little additional value for Sync with Connex.They could create lists of customers and orders, but couldn’t access important customer details like what products they were using, how long they’ve been a customer, what plan they were on, and the terms of their plan. ““Looking back, it was like running a company with a blindfold on,” Joseph said.  The problem was, PayPal lacked the reporting tools he needed, and PayPal wasn’t planning on building new features. Joseph then tried building his own reporting tool on top of PayPal.Founders with technical skills have a huge advantage. They can create the software they need at the fraction of what it would cost to hire talent. That doesn’t mean it’s free, though. If time is money, when does it make sense to build a tool internally? At what point is it more economical to pay for a service? In his case, spending over 80 hours on the project was the deal breaker. It just wasn’t worth spending so much time building a tool that wasn’t going to generate any revenue.  He then decided to migrate from PayPal to Stripe.With Stripe, Sync with Connex gains developer-friendly features, including easy integrations with Baremetrics for smarter business analytics. Using Stripe and Baremetrics, Sync with Connex Stripe’s platform includes some analytics features, but they are limited to just five categories. On top of that, there’s no ability to customize dates, so users can only look at their data in fixed time periods like four weeks, one year, and two year periods. Sync with Connex needed to go deeper in order to act on the data. Not only does Baremetrics calculate 26 base metrics (or up to 40 with additional features), users can view their data in customized time frames such as Last 30 Days, Last Month, Last Three Months, Last Six Months, Last Year, All Time, and more.Failed payments are inevitable for subscription businesses. Whether the reason is an expired credit card, insufficient funds, or outdated billing info, subscription businesses need an effective dunning system in place to prevent failed payments and recoup revenue. Before switching to Stripe and integrating with Baremetrics, Sync with Connex’s approach to dunning involved an in-house tool that would automatically turn off an account when its credit card on file failed. The problem with this was that Sync with Connex customers often missed communications about their card failing. They then had no idea that their account was turned off, and were left wondering why their data had stopped syncing and why orders had not been fulfilled. The software failed to cancel all users and some users were allowed to sync, if their payments had failed for several months. During the migration from PayPal to Stripe, Joseph recovered about $6,000 in one day of failed credit cards.Failed credit cards resulted in a high volume of angry phone calls and billing tickets that consumed Joseph’s customer success team.So when Sync with Connex started their free trial of Baremetrics, trying out Recover, Baremetrics’s dunning solution, was a no brainer.   Recover is the leading dunning solution for SaaS and subscription businesses. It uses a variety of tools such as customizable email campaigns, in-app reminders, paywalls, and credit card capture forms to bring back revenue lost from failed payments. Best of all, Recover is easy to set up and is completely automated, which means you can focus on other things while it works hard for you.Sync with Connex started using Recover in May 2021. In just 4 weeks with zero effort, they recovered $11,000 in failed payments. Billing-related support tickets have decreased by 20%, allowing both their customer success and engineering teams to focus on other projects. If your business is losing precious revenue from preventable credit card issues, definitely try Recover. Get your 2-week free trial here.  In addition to failed payments, subscription businesses need to pay close attention to which customers cancel and for what reasons. After all, these kinds of insights are essential for understanding how your product and services can improve. Before Sync with Connex migrated to Stripe and integrated with Baremetrics, they were churning 30-50 customers every month. It was difficult to keep track of who was cancelling, as well as how much money they had spent with Sync with Connex.They also lacked an efficient process for collecting feedback. For these reasons, Sync with Connex decided to try Cancellation Insights. Cancellation Insights shows you why customers cancel, and helps bring them back. The feature calculates lost revenue by cancellation reason, and automates smarter emails and forms to collect actionable feedback. For Sync with  Connex, the insights collected by Cancellation Insights were immediately helpful. Right away, they learned 3 important things: To reach the next level of an eight figure company, Sync with Connex is streamlining their sales and support processes. They are making their software simpler to set-up, growing their team, and improving their user interface.  Since launching in 2010, Sync with Connex has made over $8 million in revenue with no outside capital. Their future is focused and bright. To learn more about Sync with Connex, check out their blog. They have tons of expert information about integrating QuickBooks and taking e-commerce companies to the next level. Joseph Anderson is the Founder and CEO of Sync with Connex, a SaaS company that automates data entry between Quickbooks and online selling channels. Joseph is the author of “The $20 SaaS Company: From Zero to Seven Figures Without Venture Capital”, which published on June 6, 2021.

      "How to Get Users to Use Your Product.\n",
      "Sales are great. We love them. You love them. Everyone gets excited when money is coming in.Unfortunately, for some of us, that money might be going right back out the door in the form of refunds and/or returns. Your sales only matter if they stay that way. You can’t spend money that’s no longer there.How can you convince people to use your product, keep it, and then say nice things about it to their friends or online communities? We’ve got seven great ways. There are plenty of situations where there is nothing you can do to salvage a relationship with your customer. But there are also plenty of times when your business could have done something and didn’t. The only controllable variables are you and your company. So here are some things to encourage users to use your product, be happy with it, and help you with word-of-mouth referrals and other types of marketing.Do you know who is really good at explaining things to their specific audience? Influencers.YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok influencers know exactly what their tribe wants. Delivering what their audiences want is what keeps these influencers from doing things like getting a traditional office job. So they’re going to put in maximum effort to keep their hustle bringing in maximum revenue.Here are a few things that have been proven time and time again:You can make some people happy all the time.You can make all people happy some of the time.You can’t make all people happy all the time.Cue the influencer model. If you can build a team of influencers on different social platforms that talk about your product, use it, and show this use to their audience, you can drastically reduce your refunds and churn. Hiring influencers is a process. For a start, there are four different types of influencer:Nano-influencers—Less than 10k followersMicro-influencers—10k–50k followersMid-tier influencers—50k–500k followersMacro-influencers—More than 500k followersFocus on nano-influencers and micro-influencers when you first release your product or service. These people’s followers include friends, family, and extended networks. Essentially, their followers are people they know “IRL,” as the kids say.Not only do they have the best connection to their audience, but they’re also usually cheaper than other levels of influencer. Reach out to these influencers and find out if they’re interested in collaborating with your brand. You can also stay on the lookout for people who find your product and talk about it to see if they’re interested in any kind of sponsorship opportunity.There is no substitute for great customer service. The only people who are more tired of hearing that than you are your employees. But it’s true. If you want to reduce your refund rates, then your customer service has to be exceptional 100% of the time.So how can you maximize your customer service availability? The first thing you need to do is the most obvious. Your department’s availability should be posted on your website and in-store, if you have one. A contact us page is a great place to give this information and is a vital part of any website.Other pages on your website can be equally helpful in resolving the customers issues in a swift manner. At times that means answering the question directly in a FAQ section, or in other cases you may be able to redirect them directly to a more relevant departmment or in some cases, 3rd party services.For example, in our paid courses, customers rely on a 3rd party hosting provider. It makes much more sense for them to raise a hosting problem directly with the hosting provider than with us, and so we direct customers directly to the provider.Next, it’s helpful to set up online chats. Bots are nice, but at the end of the day, you want actual people working on the chat. This will greatly reduce your return rate. People usually use chats for quick questions and general help. Most people who request a return or refund will call or email. It’s critical to properly train your customer service staff to handle all requests quickly and to do everything they can to convert a disgruntled person into a happy customer.It’s vital to remember that the world is becoming increasingly accustomed to “Q Commerce,” and the expectation of instant answers and service is only set to become more important. One thing to keep in mind when offering a self-serve support option such as a FAQ question is that it should really only provide answers to frequently asked questions. Not just every question you can think of. FAQs are most effective when they provide a focused selection of questions that aren’t hard to scan through.They say honesty is the best policy. This is especially true when it comes to customer service and building a brand.Let’s take a moment to review some fundamentals of creating a business and building a brand around it.One of the first things you want to do is create a buyer persona. This is a representation of the person/people who are going to want your product or service. Some marketing teams like to give these people actual faces, hobbies, income levels, and so forth…What matters most is figuring out your buyers’ pain points. How does your product or service solve their problems?Once you’ve accomplished this goal, you can do some cool stuff. One of these is setting customer expectations. Now that you know how you’re going to solve people’s problems, the next goal is to explain your solution and help people understand it.If people know and understand how to use your product as intended, you will reduce your rate of returns and refunds. Educational content, provided either by you or by an influencer, is one of the best ways you can accomplish this goal.Sometimes that requires brutal honesty. For example, we know one of the key sticking points of our product is that people want results quick. Something our product doesn’t offer. Instead of sidestepping the topic we tackle it head on in our sales page to set expectations from day one. “Welcome to X. How can I help you?” Customer interaction starts here, but this isn’t where it should end. Ideally, you should be engaging with the customer throughout the process of moving down the sales funnel.You should treat your onboarding sequence the same way you would a marketing automation funnel. A surprising number of people fail to do this, but time and time again, audiences have shown they like a personal touch, even if you don’t think they will. They feel the company or brand actually cares about them and their opinion after the sale.How many times have you been to a restaurant and had great service? This honest answer is probably “not that often.” But when it happens, you feel good, right? Your server is pleasant and helpful. The food comes out in a timely fashion, it’s hot, and it tastes great. And then a manager of some sort comes around and shows your table some personal attention.“How was your meal?”“Is there anything that wasn’t up to par?”“How do you think we can do a better job with that in the future?”Mind is blown, right? We’ve all experienced this kind of fabulous service on some level. And it always makes us feel good.You should definitely focus on engaging on this level, no matter what your business is doing.But what about after the sale?You can still engage with your customers by doing things like sending newsletters, creating message boards, and performing social media outreach when people mention your product online.To give you another example, let’s say you’re trying to help people make money online with a combination of blogging content and courses. If you’ve done everything right so far, you should have blog posts and courses designed to hit people in various parts of the sales funnel.So there should be blog posts and courses for people who are just getting started. This is a great time and place to help them find the best affiliate programs for beginners.As they become more experienced, these users can be helped with content that helps make their websites better, such as how to use or recover from an unexpected Google update or how to sell their profitable niche website.Stay with these folks every step of the way. If you do, not only will you reduce your refunds, but you will give them a positive experience that they’ll continue to pay for and talk about with others in their community.When a customer calls and demands a refund, most customer service agents say something like, “Yes sir/ma’am, I can handle that for you right away.”On the one hand, it makes sense. You want to offer your customers fast and reliable customer service. But, on the other hand, why not have a conversation?Ask them why they want a refund. Ask them what you and your company could have done differently. Essentially, “Where did we go wrong?” If you offer a self-serve refund process online, set up a field asking them for their feedback. Best case scenario, you can use this information to offer assistance. Perhaps it’s clear they didn’t use the product correctly and need assistance. Or in some cases you might be able to offer an alternative product or service which is better suited to the customer.Worst case scenario, you can collect valuable feedback which can be used to develop your product.Remember how we spoke about customer engagement? Well, the best chance to do this is during the onboarding process. Use this as a chance not just to tell your customers about your product, but also connect with them and set the scene for the service you’ll be offering.The easiest way to kick start this is with a short onboarding survey. We ask all our customers a series of basic questions, including their level of experience and what they’d prefer to be called. Here’s where the real magic starts though. You can use said information to provide targeted onboarding messages that carry meaning.Let’s say, for example, you’re offering a meeting scheduling tool. You could ask your customers what their primary industry is and log that information. You can then set up individual welcome segments for each industry. For example, those working in marketing agencies would receive tailored advice on how to set up consultation calls with clients using your tool. Or perhaps someone working in the medical industry could receive tips and tricks to use the tool securely to store patient information.The possibilities are really endless here. And it all starts with a few simple, but impactful questions. There are tons of ways to personalize your welcome sequence.But first, it’s important to understand exactly what that means. It does not mean “Hi [Name], Welcome to the course!”. No, it means much more than that. One strategy we use is to send a personalized welcome video to every single customer using a platform called Bonjoro.This personalized touch is always met with absolute delight by customers and creates an incredible first impression. While this may seem like a logistic impossibility to owners of products that take large volumes of sales, consider this: how much could you save on refunds and returns if just a handful of these personal messages prevent your customers from leaving you?When you can maintain a positive relationship with people, even when they want a refund, you should do everything you can to make that happen.But the best way to fix any situation is one that keeps money from leaving your business. Go out of your way with fantastic customer service to keep customers buying, keep them happy, and keep them talking.\n"

      "Not Hitting Your SaaS Growth Goals? Here’s Five Potential Reasons Why .\n",
      "If you offer a SaaS product, you need sharp focus in three areas: customer experience, product development, and marketing.Neglect any one of these, and the long-term success of your business could be in jeopardy.Here are five of the most common reasons why SaaS businesses don’t reach their goals, and some suggestions on how to get your business growth back on track.SaaS metrics are the basis for measuring the growth of a SaaS business. They play a key role in creating an effective marketing budget, product development plan, and positive customer experiences.After all,the key to success in the SaaS industry lies in maintaining long-term growth. The best way to develop a plan with realistic goals, and to consistently achieve those targets, is through monitoring your metrics.Gathering accurate data with business analytics tools is essential for judging whether your company is on track, so you can adjust course wherever necessary. In particular, you should continuously monitor new conversions, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), and churn rate.So what happens if you discover that you’re not hitting your metrics goals? Let’s run some diagnostics on what could be going wrong.Arthur Middleton Hughes, founder of the Database Marketing Institute, cites four reasons that customers leave businesses:Why customers leave businesses is a complicated subject. But nevertheless, it raises an interesting point—any reason you can come up with likely falls into one of these four categories.If you want to improve customer retention, reduce customer churn, and stop losing customers, you have to understand why customers leave.A common metric you may have heard about is customer churn rate. This metric refers to customers who cancel their subscription to your services. This rate is calculated over a set period such as a month, quarter, or year. Your customer churn rate is expressed as a percentage, and the closer to zero it is, the better.Note that customer churn refers only to users who converted to a paid plan for a period and then canceled. This does not include prospects who signed up for a free trial and left before entering the pay period – these users are instead referred to as failed conversions.A low churn rate indicates that you have loyal, long-term customers. Maintaining long-term customers should be a top priority for a subscription service for because retaining existing customers is cheaper and more efficient than acquiring new customers.This is why a low churn rate is one of the key metrics that investors look for when evaluating SaaS businesses. Luckily, there are proven ways to reduce and maintain a low churn rate.The first step is reducing customer churn to finding out directly from your customers why they’re thinking of leaving. The best way to do this is to ask via email and/or in-app surveys.Here’s a guide on how to create cancellation surveys with a high-response rate.In your surveys, be sure to:Include a short survey that captures their main reasons for canceling.Ask if anything could be done to bring them back.Here’s an example of a form created with Baremetrics:This group of users signed up to your services because they misunderstood either the nature of their own problem, or your solution. They never should have made it past the trial, at the very latest.Solution: If customers are misunderstanding what your service offers, you can do two things:Improve your product educationSome popular education tools include software demo videos and demo meetings between new customers and sales staff.Many SaaS businesses also host pop-up chats on their landing page for visitors and prospective users. These are manned by both employees and AI bots who interact with visitors in an efficient Q&A format.Create a sales qualification processWith an efficient lead qualification process, you can identify and engage with your ideal customers.It simply starts with the definition of quality. What do your marketing, sales, and product teams define as a qualified lead?The SaaS world is constantly innovating, with new software solutions popping up left and right.If a solution comes along that better suits your customers’ needs or comes at a lower price, there’s a highly likely chance they’ll switch to the competition.To stay ahead of your competition, keep a pulse on what your competitors are doing, specifically what they’re offering, how much they charge, and how your business is different.You can also incentivize customer longevity through incentives including long-term subscription discounts, as well as through marketing strategies that encourage brand loyalty.Of course, the real key to customer retention is innovative product development, followed by excellent customer support. This brings us to the next common reason for churn.Customers aren’t receiving enough supportEven if you offer a great SaaS solution, if you haven’t invested in customer success, you could be losing business.Providing top-notch customer service starts with the tools you use.Using a CRM (customer relationship management) tool allows you to keep track of customer correspondence and monitor overall satisfaction. You should offer support across multiple platforms and with different levels of staff involvement, including email, social media, and over the phone.It’s also important to offer self-service help solutions. An extensive list of FAQs on your website, as well as easily accessible guides and how-tos make your SaaS much more accessible to your customers. This will also help free up your operators to allocate their time to bigger issues and higher value customers.When you do answer a customer inquiry, ask how they’d rate your service. Did they get the help they were looking for?You can use the information you collect to improve your service overall. If you know why customers are leaving, you can pinpoint specific areas of concern and do everything you can to improve the customer experience. With a few changes, it’s possible to improve your churn rate dramatically.Acquiring new customers can prove extremely challenging if you’re operating in a competitive market corner. Here are some tips on attracting new customers  if your growth is stagnating.There are a number of proven methods for growing your customer base. One is to get a wide group of potential customers to try out your solution for free. This costs you very little in terms of additional running costs, and has the potential of attracting a large group of spend-resistant customers.Most SaaS companies offer software trials for a period of 7 days to a month.As mentioned above, it’s important that your customers truly understand your service before signing up. If your solution doesn’t match their specific needs, they will end up wasting your resources and eventually churning.A trial is a great education tool and can help reduce this type of churn. Trials also build trust, and offering one can be the deciding factor in whether a customer chooses your service over another.Subscription trials come in various forms. For example, you can offer a forever-free plan with limited capabilities, where additional features can be unlocked with an upgrade.Spotify is one example of this tiered pricing model. The basic plan is free, whereas additional features such as cutting out advertisements, offline downloads, and unlimited song skips require an upgrade to their premium plan. This is effective because users immediately get a taste of what the service can offer, while being constantly reminded of how much more enjoyment they could be getting from the premium plan.Another type of trial provides full access to the software, but limits this access to a single user, knowing that most businesses require multiple user access.If you’re looking to create further incentives for your trial subscribers to sign up to your paid plans, special deals such as limited-time offers and promo codes could push them to make a purchasing decision. And once your begin offering free trials, be sure to track your trial conversion rate.Investing resources into generating viable leads is an essential means of attracting new customers.Various lead generation methods exist, some more resource-intensive than others. Nothing beats elbow grease and targeted marketing strategies sent directly to your ideal customer profiles, however, some of this legwork can be done through automation tools such as lead generation quizzes.If you’re still stuck, here are some alternative marketing strategies to try out.Are you spending a lot on marketing your SaaS but aren’t seeing adequate returns?There are a number of marketing mistakes many SaaS companies commit. Here are the most common ones:The price of converting each new customer is called CAC (customer acquisition cost), and is a key metric to monitor throughout every stage of growth.If you’re overspending on acquisition, you’re cutting into your profit margins. Especially if your churn rate is high, your service will quickly become financially unsustainable.Your CAC should always be proportionate to your customers’ average lifetime value (LTV). For SaaS businesses, the ideal ratio is 3:1. In other words, if you spend $100 to acquire a customer, you should expect a minimum return of $300.Data transformation software can help you identify relevant characteristics among your customers in order to devise strategies on reducing CAC and raising customer LTV.The fewer marketing resources a SaaS business has, the more likely they are to advertise to a wide net of prospects. This strategy has largely proven ineffective, however, as customers increasingly expect highly customized outreach.In actual fact, the fewer resources you have, the more targeted your outreach should be. Here’s where you should be spending your marketing budget:Data gathering with prospecting tools for access to live customer databasesCustomer segmentation with business analysis software to target the right audience for your productHighly optimized outreach with A/B tested copyData analysis on past marketing campaigns to understand what your ICPs respond toFor some additional marketing ideas, here are 6 Tips for Running a Successful Ad Campaign as a Micro-SaaS Founder.Without ongoing revenue, your SaaS company is effectively dead in the water. Hiring staff, investing in product development, and maintaining market stability all require a reliable income stream.SaaS companies are unique in the fact that their products are service-based rather than physical. The more a SaaS company grows, the lower the unit cost of each additional subscription is. In other words, profit margins should rise exponentially as your customer base grows in size.If you want to achieve sustainable growth, your revenue should increase every month compared to the last. There are a few different metrics you can use to track revenue growth.MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and ARR (annual run rate, aka annual recurring revenue) are the most common measures of subscription revenue.Expansion monthly recurring revenue (expansion MRR), on the other hand, tells you how much your subscriber income has risen comparatively month to month.There’s no quick fix to boosting MRR, however, there are strategies you can implement over time in order to increase your revenue in the long term.One element to consider is whether you’re charging enough for your product. Testing price elasticity (in other words, how much you can raise your prices before losing customers) by performing price analysis will provide insights into whether you can bump your prices up at all.Raising prices doesn’t have to look like a hard price bump, either. Some techniques for ‘soft’ price raises include adding premium plan tiers with additional features, and upselling to current customers.If you want to lock in a baseline ARR (let’s say you want to invest heavily in product development this year and need to guarantee that you can cover R&D costs), you can also incentivize your users to purchase annual subscription plans rather than monthly ones.The simplest way to do this is by offering a discount for annual subscriptions.Word of mouth is a powerful marketing tool for attracting new customers. Most people want to hear real reviews before making an ongoing financial commitment, as they’re more likely to trust the testimonials of other customers than the ad copy of a SaaS business itself.So how do you determine whether your users would recommend your services to others?There’s actually a tool for this: the net promoter score (NPS). Essentially, an NPS monitors customer satisfaction through simple email surveys. These surveys can come in the form of a rating (e.g. ‘’please rate our service from 1-5 stars’’), or a series of questions soliciting specific product feedback.An NPS survey can help you identify two separate issues:Users aren’t satisfied with your product.Users are satisfied, but aren’t recommending your product.If your users are having issues with the service itself, you need to fix the product as quickly as possible. Send follow-up surveys to identify what types of issues your users are having, or better yet, have your customer success team schedule phone calls with these users to address their concerns before they churn.If, on the other hand, your users are highly satisfied with your product but aren’t recommending it to others, think about how you can facilitate the recommendation process. In addition, consider hosting testimonials and case studies of satisfied users on your landing page.Other methods of raising your NPS score include improving the customer service experience, adding new features, and creating a more user-friendly dashboard and website navigation.So, these are the five common reasons why many SaaS businesses aren’t hitting their growth targets. The takeaway is that unless you’re analyzing your metrics, trying to boost your growth is essentially a stab in the dark.If you’re looking for a software solution that can help you track your financial data and perform in-depth metrics analysis for you, Baremetrics is the solution you need.

      "How to Optimize Product-Market Fit using Conjoint Analysis.\n",
      "Is there a version of your product that could be selling better?Unless you’ve performed extensive market testing, the answer to that question is probably ‘yes’. There’s a strong chance that minor changes to your SaaS service could significantly boost your sales.The better your product/market fit is, the better your product will perform on the market: happy customers will recommend your company to others, sales will increase, churn rates will drop, and your business will grow steadily.So how do you improve your product/market fit?This is where a powerful market research tool known as conjoint analysis comes in.Read on to find out what conjoint analysis is, how to conduct this type of survey, and how to use its findings to create a best-selling SaaS product.We’ve broken down the concept of product/market fit in detail here.In short, good product/market fit requires two factors:Here we’ll be focusing on the second aspect, namely optimizing your product to best suit the needs of your users.Improving product/market fit is an iterative process. Every change you make should bring your product in closer alignment with the needs of the users your business is hoping to attract, in other words, your Ideal Customer Profiles.The best way to determine what those needs are, and assess how well your product currently satisfies them, is to collect data through surveys.Many SaaS businesses opt for user satisfaction surveys to measure the success of their products. The Net Promoter Score, for example, is an excellent type of survey for tracking and improving customer loyalty.The problem is that it’s not enough to rely on an NPS or similar survey alone in order to make data-backed R&D decisions.Here are some of the reasons why this type of survey isn’t a reliable basis for making product adjustments:Essentially, user satisfaction surveys don’t provide enough hard data to inform service optimization. If you’re looking for actionable insights, the best method available is a form of statistics-based research known as conjoint analysis.Conjoint analysis is a market research tool used to determine which version of a product will sell the best. There are different types of conjoint analysis; this article uses generic, discrete choice-based conjoint, which is the most common type for testing different product features, marginal willingness to pay for those features, optimal pricing etc.This type of survey maps out consumer preferences with a series of questions of ‘would you rather’.Would you rather buy a blue car, or a purple one?Would you rather drink this beverage out of a cardboard container, or a glass bottle?Would you rather pay $9.95, or $10 for this service?These yes/no queries are the basis for the survey; the actual questions (known as choice sets) ask respondents to choose between complete products combining different feature variations for the sake of realism. This is known as experimental design.You don’t need a background in statistics to run a conjoint analysis survey, by the way - dedicated software can take care of that for you. Here we’ll be using the software service conjoint.ly to illustrate how to create a conjoint analysis survey, and how to interpret its results.In order to conduct a conjoint analysis survey, first you need to decide what kind of alternatives within your product or service you want to test for.This is done by breaking down your product into several components. These are referred to as attributes and levels.Let’s look at this example survey for a mobile phone.This product survey asks consumers to select their preferences for four separate attributes: brand, screen size, color, and price. Each of these attributes has levels (a.k.a. possible values) to choose between. Note that this graphic is an overview, not an actual survey question.The more options for attributes and levels you give, the more respondents and survey questions you’ll need in order to produce statistically significant results. On the flipside, you need to test for more than a couple of attributes at a time to produce surveys with enough breadth.If you’re unsure about what kinds of attributes to pick, consider what features impact your consumers’ purchasing decisions the most. For physical products such as a phone, size, color, and price are popular question topics. A conjoint analysis survey for a SaaS product, on the other hand, might ask about opt-in features, pricing, ad copy, etc.Price is an important attribute to include as one of your test attributes: it provides a baseline to test other features against, and generates invaluable data on consumers’ willingness to pay for the other attributes (more on this later).Make sure that the levels of each choice set have the following characteristics:Precise, exact valuesMutually exclusive optionsRealistic alternatives for the marketA typical survey has around 12 questions. That being said, dedicated conjoint software proposes an appropriate number of questions and respondents for the complexity of your desired test.Each question asks consumers to choose between complete product alternatives with a unique combination of values. This process determines which combination of features will result in the most popular product.The values within each choice set are randomized, i.e. no two respondents’ surveys will be identical.So, let’s take a look at how to set up a survey from scratch using the software conjoint.ly.(NB: if calculating coefficients is your jam, you can run conjoint analysis with email and a spreadsheet instead of using dedicated programs. Otherwise, software such as conjoint.ly can take care of the process for you, including creating your surveys, mapping its results on graphs, and interpolating real-life uses for this information.)To get started, simply fill in some basic information about your product, and specify which attributes and levels you want to test for.On the welcome page of your survey, it’s generally a good idea to ask questions about your respondents, too, so you can begin to map consumer profiles. Age, gender, country, number of people working in their organization etc are popular market research questions for this section.You can narrow the pool of respondents to match your ICPs by setting criteria such as ‘car users; ages 30-49; living in the USA’, for example. By running multiple parallel surveys with different types of user groups, you can effectively run a complete customer segmentation analysis, and compare your findings across different categories within your ICPs.For SaaS products, it’s very important that your respondents truly understand what your product does before completing a survey. You can include a quick demo or tutorial in the introduction to encourage educated responses.Once enough respondents have filled out your survey, it’s time to interpret their data.Conjoint analysis will not only map out which product options are the most popular in absolute terms, but by using coefficients, will weigh how much individual attributes impact consumer behavior.This helps distinguish between marginal preferences for one option over another, vs. total deal-breakers.Going back to the mobile phone example, respondents to this survey care about the brand twice as much as they do about screen size.Why does it matter by how much respondents prefer one option over another?In an ideal world, you want to create the perfect product for your consumer base.As a business, however, you also need to take into account what it would cost to make that perfect product a reality. Let’s say respondents prefer 24/7 customer support over business-hours only, but rank the level of importance for those extra hours at 10%. Those extra hours for your team are likely to cost you more than you’d eventually gain in revenue by offering round-the-clock service.If you’re testing for price (as we recommend you do), conjoint analysis coefficients also calculate respondents’ marginal willingness to pay. In simple terms, marginal willingness to pay determines how much a consumer would be willing to pay for one version of a product feature compared to another.Let’s take a look at a new body lotion. This part of the survey investigates what bottle shape respondents prefer, and how much they are willing to pay for those preferences. For this comparison, we first need to set a baseline to compare alternatives against. In this case, the baseline is calibrated to the S-shape bottle.With S-shape set to 0, we can compare how much more or less respondents are willing to pay for the other shapes by comparison. This is shown by the red bars either to the left (negative values) or right (positive values) of the baseline. For instance, a rectangle bottle is worth -$1.67 in comparison to S-shape, whereas U-shape is worth +$1.25 in comparison.This aspect of conjoint analysis provides hard data on what your optimal product price range is, and helps establish how price sensitive your ICPs are.As a market research tool, conjoint analysis provides invaluable insight into the decision-making mechanisms of buyers.In order to implement these findings most effectively, Baremetrics analyzes your subscription data and presents it on an intuitive, up-to-date dashboard.If you’re looking for accurate subscription metrics to base your development decisions on, try Baremetrics today with a free 14-day trial.\n"

      "Baremetrics vs. ChartMogul: Which is Right For Your Business in 2023?.\n",
      "Data is the lifeblood of your SaaS business. Without it, you won't know who your customers are, how to get more of them, or even if your organization is profitable or not.Unfortunately, acquiring useful data is a pain.That's why many SaaS and subscription-based business owners turn to business analytics tools. Two of the more popular options in this software category are Baremetrics and ChartMogul. The question is, which one is right for your business?In this article, we analyze both tools so that you can decide for yourself who wins the Baremetrics vs. ChartMogul debate. Let's get started!Baremetrics is a popular analytics tool for SaaS and subscription-based businesses. With it, users can access the insights they need to make better decisions and grow their companies.Want real-time information regarding your organization's MRR? What about ARR and LTV? Maybe you just want easy access to individual customer information.Baremetrics delivers all of this and more!Once you dive into the Baremetrics platform you'll realize it's composed of four unique tools: Metrics, Recover, Cancellation Insights, and Flightpath. Let's take a closer look at each:First up is Metrics, the heart and soul of the Baremetrics platform. This is where you'll find important information about your business, such as MRR, ARR, and LTV details—all of which are presented in a visually-pleasing way, so as to elevate the user experience.With Metrics, you'll never have to wonder, \"Is my business profitable?\" again. You'll simply log into the Baremetrics Control Center and learn the answer in a flash.Metrics will also allow you to dig into, segment, and display your data in a customized fashion. That way you can access the information you need in a way that works for you.For example, you can segment your Baremetrics data to discover where the majority of your customers are located. Or whether your brand has more success with small, medium, or large companies. With this information, you can adjust your strategy to boost profits.Did you know that roughly 9% of your company's MRR is at risk due to failed payments? It's true! Recover will help you recoup these losses on autopilot.Failed payments happen for a variety of reasons: expired credit cards, insufficient funds, bank issues—the list goes on and on. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter why a customer fails to pay, it matters that you get the money you're owed as quickly as possible.Recover is a top-level tool because it makes the dunning process simple and personable. Create customized email campaigns, in-app reminders and paywalls, and credit card capture forms from the same analytics platform that you use to monitor your entire business.Every business loses customers. The most successful businesses figure out why customers leave so that they can remedy issues and maintain consistent growth in the future.Cancellation Insights, another Baremetrics tool, will help you learn the reason customers cancel, accurately calculate lost revenue by cancelation reason, and build automated email sequences so that you can win back lost business.Here's how it works:Last, but certainly not least, we have Flightpath.Flightpath is designed to help you forecast revenues, expenses, and bank balances for your SaaS company. Because clear visibility into your organization's future is essential.With Flightpath, you'll be able to build a customized reporting dashboard, forecast future results in the most accurate way possible, put forecasting of simple expenses on autopilot, create a sustainable hiring plan, evaluate potential scenarios for your company, and more.You'll also be able to compare your forecasts to your actuals, leading you to make better decisions for your company, and choose an appropriate financial model for your SaaS brand.ChartMogul is another popular analytics platform for SaaS and subscription-based businesses. Like Baremetrics, ChartMogul will give you access to important company metrics, such as MRR, ARR, and LTV. It does this with its Analytics & Reporting tool.ChartMogul allows users to accurately track the company metrics they care about, giving them detailed analytics regarding their company's MRR, ARR, Churn, LTV, and cash flow. They can then use this information to understand what's working and what's not.ChartMogul also gives users the ability to segment, enrich, and audit their billing data. Which pricing plan is most profitable? Which customer profiles are most likely to convert?ChartMogul helps users answer these questions so that they can make better decisions. While Baremetrics and ChartMogul serve similar purposes, the Baremetrics vs. ChartMogul debate rages on because each platform offers different features, integrations, and pricing. Let's explore these differences in greater detail:We'll just come out and say it: when it comes to features, Baremetrics wins.Why? Because Baremetrics platform offers more to users that ChartMogul does. Yes, both tools will give you detailed insights into your company's financial health. But only Baremetrics includes dunning, cancellation insights, and forecasting features, all in one tool. Baremetrics is also equipped with Benchmarks, a tool that will help you understand how your company stacks up to similar-sized businesses; Annotations, a feature that will allow you to add notes to your data for deeper understanding; and Trend Lines, which makes it easy to average your data and NOT draw inaccurate conclusions based on randoms dips and spikes.Simply put, Barmetrics enables users to collect data and act on it—all without having to subscribe to multiple tools, which can be cumbersome and expensive.Both Baremetrics and ChartMogul offer integrations with various payment processors to users. :We should mention that both Baremetrics and ChartMogul also allow users to integrate their respective platforms with tools other than the ones listed above via API and Zapier. For example, this is how you could bring in additional customer data from your CRM or email marketing tool. Baremetrics also offers native integrations with both Slack and Intercom. With the Slack integration you can send important updates such as MRR, LTV, Churn, New Customers, Cancellations and more to your team’s Slack channel so nothing falls through the cracks.This allows teams to get instant notifications of important events as well as daily, weekly and monthly summary reports all right in your team's Slack channel, like this: And if your team uses Intercom, you’ll definitely want to check out Baremetrics’ Intercom integration. It enables a 2-way data sync between your Baremetrics and your Intercom accounts in two key ways:Provides a custom Baremetrics widget to display additional customer information like MRR, Total Charges, Delinquency status & update credit card link in the Intercom InboxSyncs tags and customer attributes for each of your Intercom users to the corresponding customer records in your Baremetrics account. Use them to segment your metrics.Okay, let's talk pricing…ChartMogul is free up to $10k MRR, whereas Baremetrics charges $129 per month for up to $10k MRR. This might make ChartMogul the preferred option for new or cash-strapped startups.ChartMogul also allows users to create plan \"families,\" which means they can bundle multiple plans together and save money. Baremetrics doesn't currently offer this.Just remember, you won't have access to any of the business-boosting features that Baremetrics offers if you choose ChartMogul. If you decide to purchase a third-party dunning or forecasting tool, for instance, you'll likely end up paying more.Data is only useful if it's accurate. So it's fair to ask, which platform, Baremetrics or ChartMogul, offers users more precise and trustworthy information?Here's the truth: both tools use the same logic and calculations. As such, both tools provide users with accurate information that they can rely on to grow their businesses.Should you choose Baremetrics or ChartMogul for your business? We can't answer that question for you. Every business is different and requires different tools.But we can tell you why many businesses prefer Baremetrics: because Barmetrics gives customers access to more features for a very reasonable price.Yes, both platforms will allow you to dig deep into your company's metrics, segment them in various ways, and display them in easy-to-understand formats. But Baremetrics offers Recover, Cancellation Insights, Flightpath, and other solutions, too.This eliminates the need for customers to purchase multiple tools. It also makes the data analysis process easier because everything happens \"under one roof,\" so to speak.We also have to mention Baremetrics' user interface, which consistently earns rave reviews for it's sleek design. You might not think UI matters that much. But once you've been staring at data for two hours straight, you'll think differently—guaranteed.The data inside Baremetrics is a joy to work with because it's so visually appealing.Managing company finances is difficult. Baremetrics makes it easier with in-depth and beautifully visualized metrics, a comprehensive way to recoup failed payments, a simple tool to crush customer churn, an accurate forecasting solution, and more.That's why hundreds of high-growth companies trust the Baremetrics platform. Join successful brands like Todoist, Hubstaff, and ConvertKit and become a Baremetrics user.\n"

      "Why should you promote your content?Your customer (or ideal customer) values great content. However, the most successful content doesn’t always equate to the best quality content.This is one of the first rules of successful content marketing:The best-promoted content wins.Does your company website have monthly traffic? If you answered yes, then there is hope. You have eyes on your content. Step 1: ✅ Step 2: Get your existing content in front of the right people, before they even come looking.Every visitor is a potential conversion, as in a lead, a customer, or a subscriber. No traffic means no conversions.This is why every piece of content must be put to work. If you invest time and money in your blog but have no promotion strategy before you click publish, you’re losing out.It’s time to fix that.Welcome to your best friend for all things content promotion. Inside, you will find specific content promotion activities and examples, along with a checklist for driving traffic to your blog articles. Pictured below is a great visual representation of what successful content promotion within your organization should look like. Let’s dive in! This playbook is broken down into three sections:Each section lays out various tactics to implement and test within the given phase of content promotion.Each of those tactics may or may not work for your content.Which is why it’s important to place bets on certain tactics and evaluate the results.This will allow you to determine the effectiveness for each segment of your target audience. Once you’ve iterated and determined which tactics + channels work for you, you will have established an effective content promotion checklist to follow every time.Let’s dive deeper into each section.These actions are taken during the content creation process. Each one increases the potential reach of the article.These actions are taken on the day of your go-live date, or immediately thereafter. This includes social media and email marketing tactics. These channels include:These actions are performed in the days and weeks after an article is published. Think of this as more of a “re-engagement campaign”.  Re-engagement campaigns can include:Ready? Let’s go 🚀Although these tactics may seem like aspects of content creation, they are really all about content promotion.Pre-publish Phase Goal: engineer an article that gets traction right out the gate. Now onto tactic #1.Step one: socialize the topic. Go to social media and post a related question, claim, or declaration that specifically aims to elicit a response from your audience. After posting, ask yourself the following questions:Next, make a list of these people, or save the link to the social post.This allows you to go back later and see who is interested in your topic.Finally, you’re going to get these individuals involved once more later on by connecting, collaborating, and co-promoting. Search is the sure-fire long game approach to driving traffic.The key here is to optimize your content with killer keyphrase research. Your research should highlight key phrases that people are looking for. Each phrase should meet these two criteria:People are searching for it (good search volume)You have a chance of ranking for it (not too competitive, based on your website’s DA)Use the phrase at the beginning of the title, in the header, and several times in the body text. Find the phrases that are semantically related to your article, then as you write your article, incorporate these into the piece.Answer the related questions (they’re in the “People also ask” box)Touch on the related topics (they’re suggested by Google as you type a query)Go deeper than the articles you’re competing with (the other pages that rank for your target phrase)Now you’re targeting the topic, not just the key phrase, which is the key to search and semantic SEO. Here is an article breaking down the step-by-step instructions for finding the phrases most closely related to your topic. Content created together with other people is much easier to promote.This is one of the reasons that contributor quotes, roundups, and interviews are so popular. They include “ego bait”, which drives social engagement.An ally in creation is an ally in promotion.Include others in your article - this gives you opportunities to mention them in later social posts. Unless the article is filled with people, it isn’t optimized for social media.“Think like a journalist: if you were writing a news story, where would you go for an expert source? Professors love to talk about their subject areas – search a university’s website for contact information.You can also look for authors on your topic (do a quick search on Amazon) then reach out. If you reach out and they don’t seem like a fit, ask if they know anyone who is right for the subject.”Erin Hueffner, ZENDESKAbove is a perfect example of the kind of quotes that further support the points/claims you are making, while leveraging an opportunity to collaborate in the future.Not sure how to find the right people to quote? Help a B2B Writer connects writers with B2B experts. It’s an efficient way to get unique quotes and is free of charge to both parties.  Original graphics not only make content more engaging, but will also make it much easier to promote across social media and in PR.Don’t just add one image → add an image at every scroll depth.Here’s an example from the Baremetrics blog. You’re not done publishing a new article until you’ve linked to it from an old article.This kind of internal linking is good for readers and it’s good for SEO.Here are two things you should do:Add a few “related links” on past posts, either at the bottom or within the body text.Use the target keyphrase of the new post as the link text on the old article.The main benefit of this tactic is that internal links can help Google understand what your new article is all about.The best internal links lead to your highest-traffic articles. These are the most likely to send visitors to your new piece. If you’re putting all that effort into creating awesome content pieces, why not encourage your readers to share your best quotes? The best way to encourage sharing is to make the process simple and immediate.Here’s how → Set up a little button that lets readers share on Twitter with a simple click.You can do this manually by using Click To Tweet, or find a plug-in for your CMS that does it for you.Example: find WordPress plugins like this. Let’s say you have a behemoth of an article. How can you help readers easily navigate your post?One way is to add a mini table of contents at the top with anchor links that allow visitors to jump down into the article. This post from Baremetrics is a perfect example of this.Those anchor points will also help you keep your article alive on social media later on.Here’s another example from Xplenty. Most content marketers focus their promotion efforts on email marketing and social media.This checklist also includes many less common tactics. Make sure you nail the pre-publishing steps above first, so that these tactics are most effective.Social media is more than a dumping ground for links. It can be used for:ResearchNetworkingConversationAnd of course, content promotionIf you have questions on how to approach tweeting your new article or what to include, follow this social post checklist to increase engagement and the click-through rate to your content. Some of the things your tweets should include are:A questionA specific benefitA quote, hashtag, special character (i.e. Emoji), etcA number (i.e. X reduced churn by 75% over Y time)A mention of contributors, commenters, and readers who shared your contentWe’ll talk more about mentions in a bit.Same as Twitter, pull out all the stops. Here’s what a hard-working LinkedIn post looks like:If you have a business page and a personal page, share from both. Or post to the business page first, then share that post from your personal page. This gives visibility to both.This is only applicable if your company actually has, and regularly uses, a company Facebook page. If so → Make sure to use an image, and that the headline looks good. Use an @ mention for anyone you included in the article.By far the most effective way to promote content in social media is through video.As with many things in content marketing, creating great video content requires 10x the effort, with the potential to achieve 100x the results.Use everything in the checklist above, plus the following:Here is a second-by-second breakdown of one-minute social videos. Just follow those steps.For some strong examples from SaaS companies, definitely check out content from UXPin and Xplenty. When a post on Facebook or LinkedIn gets early engagement (likes, comments, and shares) the social algorithm is more likely to show it to more people.The goal is to trigger the algorithm, and in so doing, dramatically increase reach.Yes, this means promoting the post that promotes the article that promotes the business. 😅It sounds weird and indirect, but that’s just how things work these days.Do this: Get a quick boost from friends, family, and partners. Reach out to them on Slack, Discord, Google Hangouts, or wherever your community  meets. DON’T send them a link to the article. Instead, send them a link to the social post. Ask them to engage with that post, to like, comment and share.Got a team? Any chance they’d like to chip in and help with marketing? This is a group that can drive quick wins for social engagement. Just drop a message like this into the company chat:“Hey everyone! We just published a great piece of content on [topic] and it’s time to promote it. This process is really important to our business and every little bit of engagement helps.It’s totally painless. Just click on this link and give it a like and comment. Huge bonus points if you share it with your network. Thank you all! These little things make a big difference…”Make it fun, but optional. Do not require (or expect) that your employees use their social streams to promote the business.ProTip: Got a team member who is very active in promoting the company content? Write them a LinkedIn recommendation. This serves both as a thanks and an incentive.If the article answers questions that your prospects ask during the sales process (the best content does)......then make sure that the sales team knows it exists, so they can easily pull it out in meetings.Here are four ways to wrap your post up in a bow for use in the sales process:The best way to create sales-optimized content, especially in product marketing, is to involve your sales team in the creation process. These articles may not be as SEO optimized as keyword posts, but they are extremely useful for marketing directly to hot leads or current customers.Simply ideate product articles with your sales team (in line with the ICP) → create in depth guides/comparison pages/case studies → get them into the hands of your sales team!The idea is to put your content in front of your most valuable audience: your potential buyers.Social mention is one of the best ways to make your content visible.When you tag someone in your social post (either with an @ mention or by tagging an image), they will likely see the notification and tap to see the post.If these individuals have some relationship to the content you’ve created, they’re likely to share. Everybody likes to get credit.Here’s where your work from the pre-publishing stage becomes very useful. Mention all of these people:Each of these provide opportunities to enlist help in promoting the content, and to grow your personal network.This tactic triggers more engagement across more networks. Here’s what you can do:Since they’ve already seen and liked the article on Network A, they’re very likely to share, like, and comment again on Network B.Here’s how you can get the most out of this tactic:Schedule at least four tweets to be published in the near future.Time them to be released during the highest traffic times for your audience (according to FollowerWonk).Schedule a few for day two, a few more for several days later, and a few more for next week.To keep posts from looking repetitive in your streams, vary their content so they are all unique and can stand on their own.The “best” time to share is also the noisiest.Try sharing when social streams are quiet, such as the middle of the night. Why? Two reasons:A lot of people use social scheduling tools…...but many of those scheduled shares go out at the hour or half-hour. To avoid getting buried in this mix, schedule your Tweets to go out just before or just after the hour.Jay Baer calls these “micro-opportunity windows”.Rather than manually creating each and every tweet and LinkedIn post, promote your content using an automation tool.Tools include:These tools allow you to:Here are some great instructions for social media automation.Continued: The tools above automate sharing of your content from your social accounts. There’s a way to automate the process of sharing your content from other people’s accounts: Quuu.Post your article to Quuu, and once approved by their team, it will automatically be shared from the accounts of other people who use Quuu.Two caveats:You may have to lend your accounts to other Quuu users.You may also have to pay for the service.If it works, you could drive tons of traffic to your posts without expending a ton of effort.Search Twitter for people with bios that include words relevant to the topic of the post, then follow them.Or again, use a tool like Sparktoro to do this kind of research.These people will see your recent tweet at the top of your stream. (This is why tactic 25 is so important: it acts as social proof for those who land on your profile.)They’re more likely to follow you because the content is directly relevant to them.This works best if you produce highly visual content, such as the diagrams we recommended above or an article with a great picture.Here’s an interesting article on using Pinterest as a B2B SaaS company for more tips. The featured section is near the top of your LinkedIn profile.It uses images, and as such, the content here is highly visible. And that visibility is retained long-term. No algorithm, no competition. Post your article here.It’s an easy win.LinkedIn Groups are making a comeback. Plan ahead and start a relevant conversation with people from the group before you publish. This is an excellent place for the first step in this process, i.e. socializing your topic.See above.A lot of older platforms are still out there. If you had an account there once, it’s probably still active. Don’t expect much, but hey, it only takes a minute to log in and share!RIP: StumbleUpon, Delicious, G+ If your content is newsworthy, consider submitting your site to news aggregators, including:I put together a slide deck containing additional relevant sites that may work for sharing content.If you have accounts on any smaller membership sites, forums, association sites, networking groups, and anywhere else you can post content, post a short summary and a link to the article there. If it’s a marketing article, here are some niche communities where you can promote, share and engage.The key: For best results, engage in these communities first. Make an investment before attempting to make a withdrawal.Sites like this have great ROI when done right. Example:Someone is talking about your topic on Quora.Find related questions and jump in with a thoughtful, detailed answer. Don’t just repost your article.Write something sincere and original, then mention and link to your article.The ideal answer is on a question that’s getting a lot of traffic.Which Quora questions are getting traffic?How can you find which questions on Quora rank?Spend some time picking out the right subreddit and getting to know its redditors. Finally, time to chat about email marketing.There is no company (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter) getting in between. Those platforms used in conjunction with email, however, can indirectly help drive email marketing results.Look back at the feedback from all of that sharing you just did. Which posts received the most engagement?Use the winning social post as your email subject line.Just make sure the best part of the subject line doesn’t get truncated in the mobile inbox. You get fewer characters on mobile than social. Subject lines get truncated after 40-45 characters on mobile devices.Here’s an example to help you get started: From: Person at X companySubject Line: Title of the articleDone.Send the article as a newsletter to your list. It should include the following:Here’s an example from Baremetrics. This email headline garnered a 25.3% open rate:Send the email at a consistent time that works for your list. A lot of the research suggests early mornings and weekends, but test this for yourself.Three or four days after sending, run a report of the subscribers who didn’t open the first email. The second email may add another 25% to the amount of traffic you got from the first email.Think this is too much email? It’s not.Remember, these people subscribed to your list.They asked you to email them.If they’ve changed their mind, they can always unsubscribe.Think: Influencers in your industry, prospects in the pipeline, journalists, and editors. One of these readers is worth a thousand strangers.Put quality above quantity. How?Very few people and companies do this, but if you’re making content for a particular customer profile, definitely try this. Time to send a special email to those who collaborated on the initial post.Even if you already mentioned them in social posts, do this:Send an email to everyone who contributed to the article. When they see the “You’ve been featured!” subject line, they’ll be happy they helped.This email is a gentle nudge, asking them to help with promotion.Share a link to the latest social post, or the article itself.BONUS: provide them with pre-written tweets or social-friendly images.Caveat: If the article is a serious piece of research, give your collaborators time to plan their promotion before launch. This version of the article is known as the “embargo version.” Prior to launch, follow these steps:Email the article as an attachment and let them know the URL where the article will be published.Pull out some key points to show the highlights.The idea is to give them early exclusive access.Gently encourage them to write a related piece.The Content Marketing Institute does this exceedingly well. Here’s an example of what they send:Did you cite anyone’s research?Mention anyone’s tools?Quote any authors?To them, you are a press hit. People love to share things that mention their work.Your blog is your greatest networking tool.This isn’t for everyone, especially the faint of heart…...but some get huge results by sending clever email copy to relevant people. What does a clever outreach email look like? Here are some cold email templates to get you started.Also, I’ve put together my own email templates swipe file over the past couple of months. You can find that here.The press release remains an effective way to promote newsworthy content. Yes, really.This is especially the case if your content falls into one of the following categories: Original researchA product launch with a strong narrative surrounding its releaseA strong opinion or new angle on an old/popular topic“Help a Reporter Out” (also known as HARO) is a service that some journalists use to find sources.As a possible source, it’s a great way to share your expertise on specific topics. Register and watch for related questions. Don’t be discouraged if your pitches don’t get picked up.Even the pros are happy with a 1 in 4 hit rate.What’s it like for the journalist you're pitching to? Josh Steimle gave it a try and reported back on the chaos. See his tips for pitching at the end of that article.Here is an example of one of my pitches to a journalist:The journalist never responded, but that’s just the name of the game!Similar to HARO, Help a B2B Writer is a great resource for both writers and sources. It’s the same idea, just focused on B2B brands and their content. One of the quickest wins is to ask a friend (who can provide a relevant link) to link to you, but don’t overuse this tactic.If the content is excellent and relevant to something your buddy made, they will most likely be happy to help.That’s what friends do. Just send them a quick DM.Does your latest article automatically get showcased on your homepage?If not, put it there manually. Your homepage is one of your most popular pages, so put it to use.When a visitor subscribes, they get a confirmation email welcoming them to your list. Then they get a few more emails over the next few weeks, guiding them directly to your best content.These are your welcome series emails.They can serve as a powerful source of traffic.You send emails every day. Every message is a chance to share your latest article.Updating your email signature takes less than a minute, and can bring attention to your latest piece from everyone you correspond with.WiseStamp makes really nice email signatures like this one:Do people actually click on links in email signatures? You bet.If you add a campaign tracking code to these links, you can measure their impact concretely.When a visitor becomes a lead or a newsletter subscriber, they land on a ‘thank you’ page. This page should not be just another dead end on your website. It’s an opportunity to share your latest high-value article with your new lead.A visitor landed on your site, engaged with the chatbot, but their answers to your questions disqualified them as a possible customer.You can use a tool like Drift or Intercom to build chatbot playbooks with qualifying questions.Qualified visitors get a scheduling widget and go right onto your sales team’s calendars. Non-qualified visitors get a link to your content.If you’ve ever given away a relevant template or tool:Go back and update it by adding a link to your new content.Add a little tracking code so you can measure traffic.FYI: It will likely be tracked as ‘direct’ or ‘referral’ if you don’t.Once again, you’ll reap the benefits of having created original charts and diagrams here. In so doing, your content links will naturally fit into presentations.Every slide that uses a graphic from an article should also contain a source link in the corner.Note: If you don’t add campaign tracking code to these links, visitors who click will appear in your analytics as direct traffic, since they aren’t coming from a browser that provides referrer data.The header image is highly visible and clickable.It has a description, which can include a link.Once again, this only applies if your company has a Facebook page.If you are actively using these tools, these are highly visible places to drop a link.You might be surprised at how much traffic your 404 page gets.Never checked traffic to this page?→ This report in Analytics is the place to take a look.Add a few links to your best content there.It’s called “the forgotten inbox.”It’s a counter-competitive channel.It’s a way to reach audiences that aren’t active online.It’s an automatic break-through-the-noise approach.Want to be in the top 1% of content marketers? It’s easy... ...just do the things that 99% of marketers do not do. This is one of them.Promoting content after it’s published is an effective way to get consistent traffic to already published and even moderately old content. This is especially true for evergreen content.This kind of content can’t be news items, or be based on any kind of rapidly changing trends. As long as the post can’t be categorized as either of those, you can continue promotion of the same article for 6-12 months after publishing.How can you amplify your existing content post-launch? Here’s how:What specific opportunities are available will depend on the content itself.If you added anchor points deep into the article, schedule posts that bring visitors directly to those deeper sections.If the article is relevant to a holiday, schedule posts for that day. (e.g. “How to take a great selfie” is scheduled to be shared again on June 21st, National Selfie Day.)If the article is an event recap, schedule a post to go out when registration opens for the next event.These posts generally have fewer mentions. At this point, you’ve already mentioned everyone plenty of times anyway.Put key points and supporting graphics into a slide deck and record yourself giving a mini-presentation of the article to your webcam. Keep it direct and concise.Use a tool like Camtasia for higher quality videos, or CloudApp for screen recording. These tools make it super simple to record and put things together (including basic editing and transitions).Upload the video to YouTube. Give it a good custom thumbnail, and link to the original article in the description.Embed the YouTube video into the article near the top. These long, detailed visuals are popular for a reason → They perform well.Never created one? It’s easier than you think. Venngage has an excellent guide for creating infographics. It gives excellent tips on the use of numbers.The best marketers don’t create one-offs -- they create interconnected hubs of content.The best content doesn’t stand alone -- it fits within a structure.Promotion is easy through internal linking if you keep publishing. So…Eventually, this will create a web of articles, both on your site and on others, that includes related visuals and text, created by you and by others.This is how to capture readers and draw them deeper into the body of your articles.If you wrote the “5 Best Practices for Jet Pack Maintenance” and published it on your site…...it’s time to write “The 5 Biggest Jet Pack Repair Mistakes” for another site. This evil twin blog post is likely to be a great pitch, and it will naturally link back to the original on your site.Every opportunity to contribute to off-site content is an opportunity to do a bit of content promotion. Never miss the chance to mention and link to your content when you collaborate with others.These content collaborations usually take three forms:The contributor quoteThe roundupThe deep-dive interviewIf your content has relevant, original data, it’s natural to link back to your content since it is the primary source.If your content has a useful chart or diagram, incorporate it into your contribution along with an image source link.Once you’ve built up a little network of related articles, package them up into a long-form guide.Use this as gated content on each of the separate articles. This is a so-called “lead magnet”, and if the calls to action are good, it’ll grow your email list.Boom. You’re now an author.LinkedIn discovered that calling long-form content a “guide” rather than an “ebook” had a huge impact on click through rates in social posts.It’s a guide, not an ebook. Try it and see the results.  It should be very natural to mention your content in the context of a presentation.“Actually, we just wrote about this on our blog…”If you talked about your content in a podcast interview, follow up with the host and suggest that the article be included in the show notes or in a follow-up email.Word of mouth begins with you.Tip: Train your sales team to incorporate these kinds of mentions in their calls/conversations with prospects or customers.There are all kinds of conversations where it’s perfectly relevant to mention your recent articles. Sales meetingsCustomer service callsClient trainingWebinarsSocial media live streamsPodcastsBONUS: Include links whenever you send follow-up emails as well. Paid content promotion is trackable and targeted, especially on social networks. The cost for targeting super specific, niche phrases is often low. If the article contains a high converting email signup form, you may find that the price was worth the new subscribers.Native advertising is popular because it’s effective. Networks like Outbrain cost money, but they can put your article in front of a huge audience. It’s easier than ever to invite people back to your website. Retargeting isn’t expensive nor difficult to set up.This one makes every other tactic more effective, because your brand remains visible long after visitors check out your post.After an article has run its course on your website, and the visits and shares seem to have died down, submit the article to LinkedIn Pulse, their publishing platform.Just click the “write an article” link from the LinkedIn homepage, then copy and paste.But aren’t you worried about duplicate content? No, I am not.The article will now be visible to a potential new audience. If you’d like to bring people back to your site…Post an excerpt of the article (50% – 80% of the full piece)Add a call to action at the end of the post, encouraging readers to visit your site directly.Here is an example of the traffic from these kinds of CTAs for the last year.If you add campaign tracking code to every internal link in every one of these syndicated articles, the attributable traffic will be much higher even than that.As above, adapt your post for a more general audience and paste it (either in full or as an excerpt) into Mention.As above. This is another excellent place to increase the reach of a piece of content. Syndication is free through July 1st, 2020. So why not submit your best content? Start the process here.Your GMB account has a place to post articles. This is one of the rare places to add content directly into Google’s database. Does it help local SEO? It might.  Is your article not getting traction? Maybe that’s because you only wrote it once.As long as you don’t change the URL, rewriting an article preserves SEO authority (inbound links) while improving the relevance (quality of the content).This is one of the most powerful SEO tactics.The idea is that you really don’t need 1000 articles.

      "6 Tips for Running a Successful Ad Campaign as a Micro-SaaS Founder.\n",
      "If you’re running a micro-SaaS business by yourself, chances are you haven’t had much time or budget to spend on marketing.In fact, most founders focus resources almost exclusively on product development, and delay thinking about sales strategies until they desperately need their first customers. Of course, that’s already far too late to start running an effective ad campaign.Without the support and expertise of dedicated staff, kicking off the marketing cycle may feel a little overwhelming. Where do you begin? Which platforms are worth exploring, and which are oversaturated money sinks? How do you elicit interest in your brand from your ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles)?Do those questions fill you with dread? You’re not alone.The good news is, marketing strategies accessible to micro-SaaS founders absolutely do exist! These don’t rely on huge budgets and full-time attention - a little goes a long way, if you start early.Here are 6 tips on how to build a successful ad campaign as a micro-SaaS business.The most common mistake first-time founders make is to wait too long before taking their business to market. Their products are often ready for distribution long before the developers themselves are. That perfectionism is losing their business money.Delaying sales also slows growth exponentially. Any revenue a business makes early on can be pumped straight back into development.Think of your first users as beta testers. Going to market early will allow you to receive ongoing feedback, which should be at the heart of all subsequent improvements.Even if you release a mature product that you feel is perfect, development must be an iterative process that responds organically to what your ICPs want. And the only way to know whether your solution truly satisfied demand is to set it loose on the market.A newly released product will never be perfectly market-adapted upon release, no matter how long it gestated. You might as well make some money on it sooner rather than later.Furthermore, custom attracts custom: your first 10 users will help immeasurably in attracting your next 100. With some of that newly gained financial stability, you can start putting some of that revenue aside for your marketing budget, too. If you’re unsure whether your SaaS has matured sufficiently to face the real world, here are 3 signs that your product is ready to go to market.The more resources you allocate to marketing, the more people your campaign will reach.That doesn’t mean that low-budget strategies can’t be incredibly effective, however; you simply need to be more deliberate with the types of campaigns you run.Heavy-hitting messaging is the most powerful tool a low-budget campaign has at its disposal. Of all the marketing specialists in the world, the one role that is frequently overlooked in high profile ad campaigns is the creative.If you’re stretching resources, you also need your marketing strategies to have a long life. Different campaign formats and platforms tend to have different life cycles. Many types of high profile campaigns tend to be effective only for a short amount of time, as viewers quickly grow tired of seeing the same ad over and over.So what are some marketing strategies with the longest viable life spans?For most SaaS businesses, content marketing and word-of-mouth marketing stays relevant, interesting, and ‘fresh’ for the longest, compared to other strategies.Looking for further inspiration? Here are some alternative marketing strategies available to micro-SaaS founders.Who you target is just as important as how you target them.If you’ve just launched your SaaS product, you may not yet know who your good-fit users are. Ask yourself: who stands to benefit the most from your solution? Who has the resources available to invest in such a tool?Once you have a broad target in mind, this guide on customer segmentation can help you narrow down your optimal user base, also known as your Ideal Customer Profiles. These users are characterized by three traits: high MRR (monthly recurring revenue), high LTV (life-time value), and low maintenance in terms of the level of staff support they require.Casting a wide net at first will help establish who your ICPs are. The sooner you can narrow down your targets, however, the more returns on your marketing efforts you’ll begin to see, especially in terms of quality of customer.All’s fair in love and war… and SaaS sales.Just kidding, we certainly don’t condone any questionable practices here.That being said, a tried-and-true method of sales is to use the flaws of your competitors against them. There are 3 steps to this process:This technique can be used in a variety of marketing channels, including paid SEO ads and content marketing. It can be subtle (listing features your competitors don’t have), or explicit (describing why you’re better than your main competitor, listed by name).Research into your competition’s shortcomings will also reveal any untapped opportunities and current gaps in the market for development purposes.The flipside of this coin is, of course, to listen to the pain points of your own users, and continually improve on your product. Otherwise, you’re giving your competitors a free shot at poaching your users in a never-ending game of Othello.As a one-person business, relegating as many tasks as possible to automation tools may sound like a great way to reduce the never ending task-load.There are many drawbacks to using automation, however. Machine learning on Google, for instance, is unlocked at 30 conversations a month. For findings to be truly reliable, however, a minimum of 100 conversations per month is optimal. In other words, as a micro-SaaS with a low conversion rate, you’re better off relying on your own market research and observations for the time being.Once you’ve run a couple of campaigns, you can start organizing strategies into portfolios to compare learnings from each cycle.The benefit of a long-term, continuous marketing strategy (such as content marketing) over an episodic one (such as a television ad) is that it’s iterative. You can course correct at any point as you go.If you do decide to use machine learning, this portfolio system will also allow you to feed in germaine elements from previous campaigns. A broader data set will yield more accurate and reliable results.Manual outreach is powerful, but time consuming. We’re not suggesting you avoid automation tools altogether - just be strategic about when and how to apply them.Appealing to prospects requires striking a balance between efficiency and personal touch. Luckily, there are great automation tools to help you with just that. Here is an overview of some of our favorite solutions.As you’ll see in that article, some processes lend themselves very well to automation. These include data scraping, email validation, tracking unanswered emails, search alerts, to list but a few.The key to automating outbound is to retain that ‘I’m talking to a human’ feel: a friendly tone, use of plain text, and a fast reply rate help enormously. The kicker? The more personalized insights you glean about a prospect through the help of automation and machine learning, the more personal your approach will appear. There are a few traps micro-SaaS businesses commonly fall into when it comes to creating a marketing budget.The first mistake is to not have one. The ‘easy’ fix? Open a separate account and start directing money into it weekly without fail.The second is to lump the entire marketing budget into a single heap.This budget should be divided into 3 categories:These should be separated out for a few reasons.Firstly, their purposes are entirely different, but all important nonetheless. Customer acquisition supports the business, brand reputation must be upheld so that prospects know and trust your product, and research brings to light new marketing opportunities in a quickly changing environment.Secondly, these 3 aspects usually come into play at different points in the sales cycle. Failing to separate them out would skew both your market findings and your financial records.Thirdly, your target ROI (return on investment) should be measured on different scales for each type of marketing. Neither research nor brand awareness tend to score better than a 2:1 ROI, whereas if the customer acquisition budget doesn’t produce 1:1 returns, the business could be in serious trouble.Finally, there are certain marketing black holes to avoid entirely. Big businesses may be able to afford premium LinkedIn accounts and bidding for competitive keywords, but as a micro-SaaS, you’d probably see better ROI throwing bills out of a high window.Sometimes, knowing where not to spend your money is just as valuable.If you’re looking for insights into how your business finances are tracking, Baremetrics can help.

      "Shopify Marketplace Kit: What It Is and How to Use It.\n",
      "The Shopify Marketplace Kit is an ecommerce tool that allows developers to sell directly from any platform, instead of going through the Shopify app. It functions as a collection of APIs (Application Program Interface) that integrate with Shopify, so that any kind of platform can function as a storefront. If you’re new to Shopify or ecommerce in general, don’t worry! Shopify provides all the documentation, tutorials, and examples you’ll need in the process.In this article, we’ll explain what the Shopify Marketplace Kit does, who it’s designed for, and how to get the most out of this groundbreaking API tool. The Shopify Marketplace Kit is designed to turn any social media or content creation page into an ecommerce platform. Shopify provides all necessary tools, APIs, and instructions for users to get up and running quickly. This includes product listings, storefronts, component libraries, and Shopify’s state-of-the-art checkout system.This kit also features some invaluable ‘soft skill’ guidelines for content, which we’ll delve into later on.Essentially, these are many of the same features offered in Shopify’s recently announced ‘Shopify Market’ tool, which we discuss here.In a recent tweet, the Shopify dev team highlighted three main goals for the wide release of the Shopify Marketplace Kit:These goals are manifested in the following features.Product listings enable customers to find products, learn about them in detail, and decide whether to go through with the purchase. These are collectively listed on a shop’s homepage. The Shopify Marketplace Kit provides all the tools you’ll need to set up product listings, both as individual and aggregated pages. This process can be customized to your needs, for example, you can set your homepage to display all the merchants operating on your site, along with their most popular products.Storefronts represent the front window of a shop. There’s a lot of information to convey all at once; Shopify’s modern aesthetic presents shoppers with all the details they need, without triggering information overload.The Storefronts API is included, so that merchants operating on your platform can benefit from the classic Shopify look. This applies to shop pages, product categories, product sorting and filtering, etc.Shopify Checkout boasts a highly optimized checkout system. For example, its localization capacities include many languages, over 100 currencies, as well as information on sales tax, shipping, and customs fees for almost every country.The Shopify Marketplace Kit offers the full range of benefits of Shopify Checkout on any integrated platform. This includes two interesting features:These features might sound strange to someone used to the siloed experience of a regular ecommerce shop. Why would you want to share a shopping cart and checkout process with your competition?What you need to remember is that the Shopify Marketplace Kit is designed to add ecommerce functionality to non-ecommerce sites. When you are on TikTok or Instagram, your primary goal is not to shop, but to browse interesting content. Allowing people to “add to cart” everything they see in those videos or images while browsing enhances the social media experience, instead of interrupting it.Now you can casually flick through videos adding fun products as you go, and then checkout before returning the phone to your pocket. The more streamlined the shopping process is, the more frequently it will be used.Channels UI is a React component library that is designed to help developers create a UI-optimized marketplace experience for their merchants.Shopify designs, builds, creates, and publishes with all users in mind. The purpose of this set of principles is to create the best possible experience for everyone. The Shopify Marketplace Kit is built with the same founding principles, and encourages developers to create a marketplace underpinned by their own values, notably efficiency, trust, and consistency.Shopify emphasizes the importance of clarity and open communication not only on their own app, but within the marketplaces of their partners, too. This is to make sure that users of all Shopify-associated platforms are always kept informed of scheduled maintenance, outbound links to unverified sites, etc.Back in October 2020, TikTok first partnered with Shopify. The purpose of this partnership was to connect Shopify merchants with a young TikTok user base. This provided TikTok with a new sales channel, which became a new means of monetizing the network.This partnership expanded in summer 2021, following TikTok’s new integration deal with Shopify that established the media site as a comprehensive ecommerce platform. As a result, TikTok users could sell products directly on TikTok with all the benefits of the full Shopify buyer experience. This means big business for TikTok and its social media stars such as Kylie Jenner, who could now market directly to a young audience.Following the considerable success of the TikTok partnership, Shopify expanded their marketplace integrations with Facebook, Pinterest, Google, and Spotify, to name just a few of the big players.They haven’t stopped there: Shopify Marketplace is now available for any team to use, complete with all the necessary code snippets, APIs, tutorials etc.The Shopify Marketplace Kit might seem intimidating at first - surely anything so big and powerful must have a huge learning curve! Thankfully, Shopify takes as much care in teaching as they do in coding.The first thing you’ll want to do is run through this tutorial. This guide will help you set up routing, access, and a data query framework for your marketplace, in accordance with the following flow chart from the Shopify website:This three-step tutorial teaches you how to perform three important tasks:creating routes to render merchant-facing and buyer-facing pagesusing Storefront API tokens, including retrieval and storage, for multiple shopsadding an internal GraphQL endpointKnowledge prerequisites and learning materialsIt should be said, however, that this is not an entry-level tutorial. Shopify assumes some prior knowledge, notably from their “apps getting started” and “GraphQL and REST Admin API getting started” tutorials. Furthermore, you should already be familiar with Shopify channels and the Storefront API. You’ll also need authentication using the OAuth and offline access modes.Ideally, you’ll already have some experience turning your app or platform into a sales channel, but if not, Shopify’s comprehensive tutorial will guide you every step of the way.Upon completion, several further tutorials are available to walk you through Shopify’s additional features.The Shopify Marketplace Kit provides additional sales channels for merchants and Shopify Partners alike. As more platforms integrate with Shopify, opportunities for exciting new apps are multiplying. Developers who build Shopify apps know the challenge of monitoring business growth. It’s hard to keep track of how your apps are performing, and to gain real insights into areas requiring improvement. This applies double if your customers are merchants operating internationally. That’s why Baremetrics has built a comprehensive integration system with Shopify Partners. Using Baremetrics, ‘Shopify Partners’ developers can monitor over 26 subscription metrics including MRR, churn, and conversion rates, all in one dashboard.

      "Shopify Markets: What Shopify Partners Need to Know.\n",
      "As the ecommerce sector grows in size, it also grows more competitive. One of the best ways to maintain your edge over the competition is to go global. However, selling globally comes with a series of challenges. There are many factors complicating international sales compared to local ones. Shipping costs, local sales taxes, and customs fees vary widely, and no one can be expected to know these rates off the top of their head. Hidden fees within currency conversions are another key issue, since banks rarely offer you the market rate.Thankfully, Shopify has recently launched a tool, Shopify Markets, to help navigate the process of international sales. Shopify Markets takes care of all the necessary tasks so individual merchants don’t have to. From providing multi-language support and currency conversions to shipping and import fees calculation, Shopify Markets does it all. They even provide custom domain names and access to local payment processors.Don’t think all of these advancements only help merchants. Shopify Partners now have a whole new process and product to improve upon with great apps. With merchants going global, this interaction provides ample opportunity for creative Shopify Partners to produce great new apps.In this article, we go through all of the new tools, APIs, and possibilities found in the Shopify Market. If you are a visual learner, please watch the YouTube video announcing all of the changes, but then hurry back as we break down all the changes and link you to all of the resources mentioned in the video!In Shopify’s recent townhall dedicated to Hydrogen, they announced the new Shopify Markets initiative. Broadly speaking, Shopify Markets is designed to make it easy for merchants to take their shop global by automating the internationalization of stores.The areas of improvement can be split into two functional groups: those that help localize shops and those that provide operation tools to accelerate global growth. Before we go through all of them, keep in mind that this is a rapidly developing set of tools. As such, not all of them are online yet, so merchants and Shopify Partners should check back often to see what new goodies have arrived.You can consider all of the tools to help with market localization as the outward-facing part of a merchant’s new global store.The features ready at launch include: domains, currencies, languages, duty and import taxes, and payment methods. Let’s take a look at each of them.Customized domains for different locations and languages are now possible. There are three ways to do this: primary domain only, domain or subdomain, and subfolders. These are SEO-friendly solutions and easy to implement with the help of Shopify Markets. Notice that both language and country groups can be made. This comes in handy for countries with multiple languages. For example, you can use shop.com/en-ca for English (en) Canada (ca) and shop.com/fr-ca for French (fr) Canada (ca).Here’s the slide from the Shopify townhall:You can find more information on the routes object here.Shopify Markets supports 20 languages. These new localization features can help merchants translate their stores to meet the shopping needs of more customers.Here’s the slide from the Shopify townhall:Shopify Markets supports 133 currencies. This isn’t as easy as you might think. Beyond just switching the currency, different locations also have different rules about rounding purchases. With currencies come market optimization options that we will get to a bit later. Suffice it to say, having 133 currencies is a lot more than a simple calculator function. Here’s the slide from the Shopify townhall:You can find more information on the presentment currency fields here.Taxation varies widely from country to country. Some countries charge a sales tax, while others use a value-added tax (VAT) which requires more complicated calculations. Some countries have a flat sales tax on all products, others use a variable sales tax rate based on the product class, and others completely exempt certain products or products originating from certain other countries. The same is true for import taxes and other duties. The origin and destination countries can both factor into the rate. All of this is enough to scare away even seasoned ecommerce vets. Thankfully, with Shopify Markets, merchants do not need to know any of this information. They can simply select the countries they are willing to ship to, and Shopify does the rest. Shopify Markets can even vary the shipping rates by country.Shopify Partners with apps in the accounting or shipping sections of the Shopify App Store should especially take note of these changes. They may affect the way your apps function or offer inspiration for your next big release.Here’s the slide from the Shopify townhall:You can find more information on the Order API following the links to: REST and GraphQL. You can generate commercial invoices with the help of the product prices, HS codes, and country of origin InventoryItem resource found here. Finally, you should also take a look at the fulfillment orders API.While PayPal and credit cards dominate online B2C purchases in America, the same is not true for the rest of the world. One of the most important ways Shopify Markets helps merchants cater to shoppers around the world is to allow them to use the payment methods popular in their country. While they aren’t ready yet, Shopify has two more tools on the way that will help with your international expansion. First, they are going to introduce tools for content localization. Second, they are going to offer localized product feeds. We are excited to see what these functions will offer and how Shopify Partners will develop apps to support these great new features.Any Shopify Partners thinking about app ideas to do with translation or content marketing should be excited by these new changes. While most of the market localization functions are ready to go, more of the market operation tools are still works in progress. We do have three to discuss today: markets admin, market optimization, and market-specific pricing.The new market admin is a great time saver. It is designed to help merchants create localized storefronts from their main store. Starting from a single screen, the merchant is able to customize the shopping experience in each cross-border locality. This is important as what sells and why is drastically different from country to country. A hard sell might be needed in one country but a total turn off in another.Localization can mean to a country or to a region, and both options are available on Shopify Markets admin page. A merchant can choose to have different localizations for every country in Europe or a single one for the entire European Union. Remember that languages and regions can be done separately, so having a single EU shop won’t prevent a merchant from creating shop.com/fr-eu, shop.com/de-eu, and shop.com/sp-eu to cater to French, German, and Spanish speakers, respectively.Here’s an example look at the admin page from Shopify’s blog:Merchants need to understand local markets and make local changes based on that. Market optimization provides the tools to both understand different markets and make changes on the admin page to maximization revenue. You can see how your sales are doing in different localities along with many of the important related sales KPIs, such as conversion rate, average order value, total sales percentage, and total sales volume. With all of the related functions, such as shipping and payments, right next door, it is easy to makes changes on the fly based on the data coming in. Just as Baremetrics is built to help Shopify Partners interpret their data, there are loads of opportunities here for Shopify Partners to create apps to help merchants understand and put into action the rich information provided on this screen.Here’s a sample look at the country-specific dashboards on the Shopify platform to help optimize local selling. Here’s the backend half of the currency announcement discussed above. Different countries have different local economies. A person in America might be happy to spend $40 on a T-shirt, but that’s not the case in Thailand. It isn’t enough to change the Greenback into Bhat. For example, instead of just converting USD to CAD, if Canadians are being hit by import duties and underperforming the American storefront, a merchant could also adjust the price by -10% to boost local sales. Conversely, if they find their products are doing incredibly well in Italy due to a lack of local competition, they can adjust the price by +10%, then +20%, and so on. Shopify Markets has announced three more tools aimed at improving market optimization: market-specific catalogs, market-specific fulfillment, and market-specific payouts.These definitely look like functions that enterprising Shopify Partners could iterate on!Developers who build Shopify apps know the challenge of tracking their business growth. It’s hard to get real insight into how your apps are doing and where you can improve. That’s why Baremetrics built its integration with Shopify Partners. Using Baremetrics, Shopify Partners developers can monitor 26+ subscription metrics like MRR, churn rate, and conversion rate all in one dashboard. If your customers are merchants who are expanding internationally with Shopify Markets, you should definitely be tracking how these changes affect your business financially.

      "What Is Shopify Checkout?.\n",
      "Shopify Checkout is Shopify’s native payment gateway. It’s both highly secure and easy to use, which makes it one of Shopify’s most valuable selling points.Shopify Checkout supports both sides of a transaction: customers submit an order request, input payment details and select a shipping option, and merchants choose to accept or query the order through a centralized system.Shopify Checkout also provides its Partners a lucrative development opportunity. The payment gateway is fully functional as a stand-alone, however, Shopify strongly encourages third-party developers to build and market their own Shopify apps to improve and diversify the checkout process.Read on to find out why Shopify Checkout is such a great product, and which additional third-party apps we recommend.Shopify Checkout is the best payment gateway found in ecommerce today.Here are some of the many features and functions of Shopify Checkout that position them as market leaders.1. FlexibilityAs the world of ecommerce evolves, Shopify releases annual upgrades and new features in order to meet the changing needs of global users.While Shopify’s native product is a powerful system in and of itself, Checkout owes much of its flexibility and versatility to third-party app developers, who are free to build any additional features as they see fit. Not only is this a great advantage to their user base, but also to the developer community: once vetted, Shopify supports the sale of these third-party apps through their own app store.2. SpeedTo this day, Shopify Checkout has processed over 2.5 billion orders. This system is top of the line in terms of speed, which not only means happier customers, but results in more sales conversions too.3. TrustIn 2021, Shopify overtook Amazon as the busiest ecommerce platform. The numbers are staggering. Over 300 million customers have used Shopify Checkout, which represents $100 billion in sales across 2.5 billion orders.In other words, Shopify supports a vast network of loyal customers worldwide.4. Close rateHigh customer satisfaction equates larger sales. This is a well-known fact in all branches of commerce, which is why businesses of all sizes invest in raising their customer satisfaction.Shopify’s checkout experience is both simple and fast. This minimizes the window for prospective customers to quit out of impatience, get side-tracked with another task, or simply change their minds mid-purchase.Shopify’s accelerated checkout system, known as Shop Pay,  further increases the conversion rate of Shopify stores because it beats the speed of third-party payment processors by a whopping 60%.For SaaS businesses, subscription revenue is the single best way to boost income. Shopify Checkout allows merchants to sell subscriptions as well as one-off products, which brings in an ongoing revenue stream.Subscription sales also open up a whole other dimension of opportunities for third-party app developers.I’m old enough to be surprised that 70% of shoppers make their purchases on their mobile phones, but the fact of the matter is, that’s just the world we live in. Shopify understands their user base well; their checkout process not only works on mobile, but is actually optimized specifically for mobile.This means less faff for consumers, resulting in higher sales conversions than for checkout systems that refuse to acknowledge that the days of desktop buyers are fading.Shop Pay is a great way to pay on Shopify Checkout, but it is only one of many supported payment methods. Others include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.Customers can also use popular local methods of payment, multiple currencies, and digital wallets.Shopify not only collects a broad range of data on customer behavior, but also gives merchants free access to all the information the platform has gathered.The best way to action this data is through Baremetrics. Baremetrics integrates with Shopify directly, and plugs all your financial information into your dashboard to create personalized insights into your business. Try it out for yourself with Baremetrics’ free trial.While the full functionality of Shopify Checkout is offered as a part of Shopify’s user plan, there are many third-party apps available via the Shopify app store to make the checkout process even better.Here are some of our favorites.One-Click Checkout One-Click Checkout allows customers to bypass the shopping cart page and go directly to checkout. This app is perfect for any shoppers in a hurry.There are 3 price plans: a free plan, an unlimited plan at $9.95/month, and a priority support plan at $18.95/month.One-Click Checkout scores an average of 4.7/5 stars. One review from Borealis Watch Company reads, ‘’Great app, allows to increase conversion rates. Support team is fast and responsive to questions. Definitely recommended.’’Multi Currency Checkouts+ Multi Currency Checkouts+ gives users the ability to trade in multiple currencies without having to do any coding.The basic plan is also free, while the standard plan costs $7.99/month, and the pro plan costs $8.99/month.The app’s overall rating is 4.7/5 stars. One review from Pet Creations Art Ltd. reads, ‘’Great app and helpful staff! They are happy to help with any requests and deal with them promptly! Would definitely recommend.’’Product Warnings on CheckoutProduct Warnings allows merchants to create popup warnings for different products in their shop. These could relate to shipping delays, sold-out products, or items available for pre-order, for example.Product Warnings has a free version, as well as an unlimited plan for $9.95/month.Their overall rating is 4.8/5. One review from Sun Active Inc. reads, ‘’Reached out to the developer requesting a minor customization to the app. They replied in less than 24 hours, were pleasant, and made the requested changes.’’MultiBuy Sales BoosterMultiBuy Sales Booster is designed to allow customers to buy multiples of a single product, or to add many different products quickly, without clicking through to the individual product pages.They offer a single plan at $2.99/month.This app scores 5/5 stars. A review from Viva La Vapes states, ‘’Overall this app improves the user experience tenfold. The help desk are responsive with a reply being sent through within 24 hours normally - max 48hrs. Highly recommend this app, it is simple and does the job.’’Users who have some coding experience can also customize Checkout manually using Shopify’s Storefront API. Shopify offers custom storefronts as part of their plan, and has included a comprehensive guide on how to use this tool here.Shopify Unite 2021 was one of the biggest Shopify Unite events in company history. Numerous substantial updates were announced, including Shopify Hydrogen and Oxygen for Shopify app developers, as well as a brand new version of the Shopify Partners dashboard.One of the biggest changes affecting Shopify Partners was the revenue share change. App developers now pay 0% revenue on their first million in revenue every year, and only 15% thereafter, positioning Shopify as the most profitable platform for their partners compared to their competitors.Shopify Checkout also got a makeover; here are some of the updates we’re most excited about.Go big or go home, right? To give you an idea of how much the through-put of Shopify Checkout has improved, picture the sales frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Shopify now enables every shop to process that same volume at any moment. That’s almost 40,000 purchases per minute for every shop!Secure app-building with Checkout ExtensionsShopify Unite has a long tradition of optimizing their platform for the benefit of merchants and Shopify Partners alike. In some cases, a single feature update caters to both ends of that user spectrum. This is the case for Checkout Extensions.With Checkout Extensions, it has become much easier to customize Shopify Checkout. This not only opens the process up to more app development opportunities, but also provides merchants with many new options, such as in-cart upselling or including a donation button with a purchase.Shopify Scripts allows developers to add a range of new functions to their stores, including in the checkout process. Shopify Scripts executes within Shopify, so can be scaled up at volume.For example, a developer could create an app that displays estimated carbon emissions of different shipping methods, so customers can enforce environmentally conscious choices.For merchants who wish to develop a different style of checkout, Shopify Scripts also allows developers to change the overall look and flow of this process as well.Shopify’s new Payments Platform replaces their legacy system of integrations, so that payment processors can connect with the Shopify platform more easily.As a result, Shopify Partners can now create payment gateway apps. Shopify merchants will be able to spread to more niche markets, as well as sell in more locations across the globe. If you want to optimize the way you build your Shopify app, we can help.

      "How to Measure CX Through These 6 Crucial Customer Experience Metrics.\n",
      "Managing the customer journey means understanding context and measuring the right metrics. Customer experience (CX) is a critical component of modern business management, but it’s far too easy to get lost in the sheer mass of available data.Customer goals need to be aligned with business goals. It really is that simple. Unfortunately, CX measurement remains challenging. If you want to deliver the customer experience that will turn a one-off sale into a brand advocate then you must monitor and measure every stage of the customer journey to find out what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong.Here are the CX metrics that you need to be monitoring and measuring if you want your customers to have the experience that your brand is fully capable of.There’s no avoiding the fact that the single most important CX metric to obtain is your net promoter score (NPS). Unlike the most common vanity metrics, an NPS score is a very real data set that measures how likely it is that an existing customer would recommend your business to someone they know.NPS is based on a simple survey, asking your customers how they feel about their experience of buying from you. Then, you simply use your responses to gauge how effective and seamless your existing CX is. In a standard NPS survey, responses from 0-6 are referred to as “detractors”. These are the customers who wouldn’t recommend you to a friend. Scores of 7-8 are known as “passives”, and customers that give a 9-10 score are your “promoters”. These promoters are your company ambassadors, so keep them happy. However, it’s those customers who have given a 0-8 score to your business that you need to look at more closely. They clearly have had a less than desirable experience buying from you, so you now have the opportunity to work on your CX and improve NPS.  This approach will take you one step closer to being a customer-centric organization, which should be the goal of all business leaders in today’s consumer-focused landscape.Data is more important than ever, and every company with a focus on business systemization needs to use its available data to improve the customer journey. By using your analytics, you can more easily identify when the customer journey has roadblocks that result in a no-sale.The key here is to create a customer journey map so that you fully understand every step of the customer experience. Having a visual representation of the customer journey will make it far easier to understand how well you're resolving pain points, understanding consumer motivations, and identifying precise customer motivations.Ignore your vanity metrics, and look instead at the data provided by your website, events, reviews, surveys, and social media. Use the analytics of those touchpoints to learn more about the existing friction in the customer journey. By doing so, you’ll learn exactly how and where you need to fine-tune your CX to better support your existing and future customers.Often, small changes can transform the customer experience. Even something simple like adding a BPO call center to your customer communications can dramatically improve the CX. What is a BPO call center? It’s a simple step that improves communications, which are often where the CX often collapses. Take note of your analytics, learn from the data, and make changes where you discover stumbling blocks.Customer churn rate simply describes the customers who have abandoned your company. It’s got a definable and actionable formula: customers that churned over a time period divided by customers at the start of that given time. That could mean they have unsubscribed from your email newsletters, haven’t renewed their subscriptions to your service, or just won't buy from you again. Of course, churn is an inevitability. The important thing to remember is that while you will always have customers who leave, knowing why they abandon you is vital. When you closely monitor your churn rate, you’ll have an immediate metric that can help you reduce the churn rate in the future. Always consider the seven Rs of customer retention - simply because it’s more cost-effective and profitable to retain an existing customer than attract a new one.Once you know if your churn rate is growing or reducing, you’ll be able to more easily take actions that’ll reduce churn. It could be that your customers have had a poor experience on your communication channels, indicating that you need to implement a call waiting service to streamline this. Poor customer support is one of the main reasons for a high churn rate, so measure your lost customers as much as consistently as your brand advocates.When it comes to measuring your CX, it doesn’t come any more straightforward than doing a quick after-sales survey to build a customer satisfaction score (CSAT). Every time that someone calls your virtual phone number or makes a purchase from your website, make sure that a quick survey question is delivered immediately.This should be as easy to answer as possible. The question should be something along the lines of “how satisfied were you with your experience?” The responses should be easy to click on with a scale of 1-5 or 1-10. The average score of that survey will be your CSAT. That immediate feedback is a quick and easy way to learn more about the CX. Unfortunately, many business owners fail to appreciate the value of a CSAT score because it can feel a little abstract. It doesn't for example, measure brand loyalty or the reason behind an interaction. However, CSAT should be measured continuously, as it offers immediate insights into the customer experience.Another way to get a glimpse into your CSAT is simply by looking at your online analytics. For example, a high page bounce rate is an indication that there’s something wrong with your customer journey. That could be a landing page that’s loading too slowly, your navigation isn’t clear, your introductions too rambling, or even something basic like a lack of brand consistency. Learn the difference between bounce rate and exit rate, and make changes where they’re needed.The questions that your customer service team gets asked are a goldmine of information. Too many brands overlook the importance of monitoring the questions that customers ask and so they miss common and frequent questions that will highlight roadblocks and friction in the customer experience. The first step is to ensure that your audience can communicate with you in as many ways as possible. That means monitoring social media, initiating a remote call center management system, and having an always-on email response team. If you're getting the same questions or the same complaints consistently then that’s a metric indicating a problem. It’s much easier to resolve a problem if you know it exists. Monitor your communications, and learn from them.Customer effort score (CES) is often mistaken for a CSAT, although the two are slightly different. A CES measures how much effort your customers have had to exert to resolve their pain points. This could mean a purchase or getting a response to a query about your products.The main thing to remember with CES is that the higher your score, the more likely that you’ll get repeat customers. Low scores lead to customers simply not wanting to do business with you again as you're making things too difficult. This was highlighted way back in 2010 when HBR published a study highlighting that the key to building customer loyalty wasn’t to wow your customers, but to simply make their experience with you easier.Ever since, CES has become an essential part of any business model. From earned to unearned revenue, a customer effort score is an essential insight into the experience of your customers. It’s less about customer satisfaction with their interactions, and more about the amount of effort they have to exert to resolve their problems. Of course, like the CSAT, getting your CES means asking questions after interactions and engagement. For example, if you're a realtor who is getting a high page bounce rate, that’s an indication that you're not offering what your customers want. Ask questions, and you’ll find out quickly that those customers are looking for a virtual open house rather than static images on your website or in-person showings. Always ask what you could be doing better and you’ll get the insights that are far more valuable than your social media vanity metrics.Businesses are overwhelmed with information. There’s so much data and so many platforms that provide vast amounts of detailed analytics that it can be hard to sift through the pointless metrics and focus on the wrong things. Knowing the right metrics is as valuable as gathering that information.There are so many businesses focusing on the wrong metrics that mistakes are too easily made when it comes to customer experience. Using the right analytics and reliable reporting tools like Baremetrics streamlines the gathering and reporting of the right metrics. That level of automation is extremely valuable in today’s fast-moving business landscape.

      "Testimonials and Case Studies: How to Use Customer Satisfaction as Your Greatest Marketing Asset.\n",
      "I don’t know about you, but whenever I’m considering making a significant purchase, the first thing I do is head to the review section.Whether it’s novelty curtains or writing software, I always want to know what my peers think about a product first. Their opinions are the ones I place the most weight in - their reviews are unbiased (compared to the product’s creators or their competitors, at least), up-to-date, relevant to my needs as a consumer, and more often than not, make for an entertaining read.This is actually a very common phenomenon: we trust people we can relate to. That’s why politicians and business leaders often perform ridiculous stunts to appear relatable to the public, because relatability is currency.This idea also applies to SaaS businesses. The best way for a SaaS business to attract new customers is to demonstrate how current users are successfully using their products.It’s also worth mentioning that using satisfied customers as an advertising channel is an extremely cost-effective marketing strategy.Keep reading to learn how to use testimonials and case studies as a powerful marketing tool for your SaaS business.Testimonials and case studies are both word-of-mouth marketing strategies that use the customer experience as the foundation of their campaigns. However, there are some key differences between them in terms of structure and target audience. It’s important to know which one to use in what circumstance to maximize their effectiveness.Testimonials tend to be most effective when they’re short, sweet, and come in large quantities.Here at Baremetrics, we’ve created a testimonial collage known as our ‘Wall of Love’. Here’s the first page:Shucks, guys.So, what makes a testimonial page convincing? Essentially, this boils down to four elements: relevance, variety, tone, and design.What do your prospects care about the most? Think about your most popular features and make sure these appear front and center on your testimonial page.Who you quote is just as important; your featured users should feel like peers to your prospects, and encourage the line of thinking of ‘it worked for them so it will work for me’.If your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) is a micro-SaaS, for example, most testimonials should be penned by fellow micro-SaaS founders.Each testimonial should focus on a different aspect of your product. Think of your testimonials as a fishing net: every square uses a different bait with which to hook your prospects.Try to mix it up so that every line contains something specific to your business, as well as some popularly searched keywords for your target ICPs.Going back to our Wall of Love as an example, here are some of our featured buzzwords that we know are important to our prospects:GrowthMetricsDataInsightsChurn And here are some phrases our current users have been kind enough to say about us:Definitely worth the investmentMakes my daily job a lot easierIncredible insightsOur go-to dashboardFriendly support and continuous product improvementAs you scroll, a lot of these terms begin to repeat themselves at regular intervals. The content of these testimonials must be 100% verbatim, but you can, and should, curate the order in which they appear in the same way you’d optimize your ad copy for maximum impact.Ideally, the testimonial page should consolidate the core promises of your solution without seeming repetitive.The most effective testimonials sound natural and fair. You want your featured users to sound enthusiastic without being over-the-top. If they’re waxing a little too lyrical, you run the risk of having prospects suspect you’ve enhanced or even purchased positive reviews.Good design relies on a few core principles. In order for your material to be most effective, it’s worth investing some time into learning how to best organize your page.Here is a great guide on visual hierarchy. This principle considers what order people absorb information in, and is applied to almost all visual design.You must also take different formats into account; your prospects might be accessing your content on a mobile, PC, tablet, etc.The best way to collect testimonials is just to ask! If users are satisfied with your services, chances are they’ll be happy to talk about them.You can do this via phone call or email. If it’s the former, it’s customary to send users a copy of the typed up testimonial before uploading it. You’ll also want their written consent for using their name, title, company name and photo (if you’re adding that personal touch) on your website.Here are some prompts you might want to send your users to incorporate into their testimonials:What are their favorite features?What was their business life like before using your product vs. after?How is your product helping them grow?If using email is too onerous, here are some great tools for automating the testimonial gathering process.Once users have submitted testimonials, you might ask them if they would be willing to post them on independent review sites as well. Here’s an example of Baremetrics’ review page on TrustRadius.The benefit of posting on external sites is that a broader audience will see the review. The main group of people who will view testimonials on your own domain are prospects already considering your solution, whereas on a site like TrustRadius, users can browse through a broad range of similar products matching their search criteria.Because the hosted review is on an external site, this type of testimonial may also strike prospects as more trustworthy.Keeping an eye on how your company rates on various review websites will also help you monitor any customer dissatisfaction, and provide invaluable insights into how your competitors are doing relative to your product.The main differentiator between case studies and testimonials is the depth of the review. Unlike a testimonial page that benefits from high volume, case studies are most effective in small quantities.A compelling case study is solution-driven, relatable, and illustrative.Here’s an example of the ReadMe case study for Baremetrics.What problem does your product solve, and how? This is the key question your prospects are interested in.In our ReadMe case study, the focal point is cutting churn. This goal heads up the entire review - kind of like our tl;dr version for prospects who don’t have time to read the full article, but still want to get an idea of how our solution works in the real world.This study is structured as Problem - Solution - Outcome. First, we outline what issue the team had been facing. Then, we describe our diagnostic process and proposed solution. Finally, we list the results of our implemented solution and demonstrate how our product helps ReadMe achieve their goal of cutting churn and increasing MRR.By the way, if you’re also looking for a solution that can help you reduce churn, boost MRR and increase user LTV, Baremetrics analyzes your business data across 26 different metrics. These tailored financial insights show you exactly where your missed business opportunities are, what plans are bringing in more revenue than others, and where your team’s focus should be. If you’re interested in trying Baremetrics for yourself, sign up for our free trial here!In a case study, the voice of the user is as present as the product itself. Your prospects should be able to relate to the reviewer, which is why it’s critical that your featured users closely match your ICPs. If your product targets more than one ICP, each case study should represent a different one in order to cast a wider net.Presumably, your ad copy already speaks volumes about the benefits of using your software. In contrast, the purpose of a case study is to showcase how exactly your solution transformed one specific business.Prospects reading your case studies should be able to empathize with the subject of the case study. ‘Wow, we’re facing that same problem right now! This solution can work for us too’ is the ideal reaction a case study aims for.Another reason prospects look at case studies is to get an inside view of the product in use. Demo accounts and tutorial videos are great from an informational point of view, but viewing all features at once, especially for an unfamiliar type of product, can be overwhelming. (We still think ours is pretty great though!)Instead, reading about a single feature and its real-world application in a case study can give prospects a much more concrete sense of the entire product. It’s also a faster way to form an impression with less of a learning curve than doing a deep-dive into a demo.Include plenty of screenshots! Case studies are a great opportunity to showcase your solution in action.The most compelling way to attract new customers is to demonstrate that your current users are satisfied with the solution that your product provides.Featuring testimonials on your landing page is the most effective way to do that.Essentially, this serves to convince prospects that your solution is the best on the market. Aim to feature a large volume of short testimonials to demonstrate that many, many users have chosen your product over the competition.Case studies, on the other hand, cater to prospects who want to understand exactly how the process works. Demonstrate in detail how you solved a specific pain point for a user and transformed their business life for the better.You can choose to focus on either type of review, or you can use both! Start talking to your users today about how you impacted their lives: a marketing goldmine is right at your fingertips.\n"

      "How to Use the Shopify CLI to Build Shopify Apps.\n",
      "Shopify’s CLI (Command Line Interface) is one of the best tools for building Shopify apps. Shopify CLI helps Shopify Partners perform a number of important app-building tasks. This includes generating Node.js, PHP, and Ruby on Rails apps, as well developing app extensions, themes, and Shopify Scripts (currently in beta).Shopify CLI also automates a number of these tasks, which shortens and simplifies the app-building cycle significantly.In this guide we’ll cover some of the tasks you can perform with Shopify CLI and the benefits of this specific tool for app developers. CLI stands for Command Line Interface. CLI tools are scripts, programs, and libraries that have been created for a specific developmental purpose.Shopify announced the beta release of the Shopify CLI for apps in November 2019. Their goal was to help developers speed up the app creation process and boost productivity.How? By releasing a tool that could help in two ways: create a scaffolding for app code, and partially automate app development. The Shopify CLI for apps is currently on version 1.1. Since the beta release, there have been major improvements to its robustness, and it can now be installed easily across more platforms, including Windows 10.  Shopify CLI simplifies the entire app development process. It removes some of the major barriers to entry first-time developers face, rendering app development more accessible to all kinds of users.It’s also designed to be highly flexible, so it can be used for a range of different types of apps.These principles of flexibility, adaptability and accessibility manifest within a number of key design decisions:CLI can be used on Windows as well as MacDevelopers install the program in whatever language is most comfortable to themTools are open source and don’t require escalating privilegesOperations don’t self-destruct; users are in full control of deleting files and projectsLet’s take a look at Shopify CLI in action!Shopify CLI for apps is a highly intuitive tool. Shopify and GitHub also provide detailed tutorials for every step of the way.Shopify CLI can be installed on a number of different operating systems. The easiest way to do this is through your computer’s own command line. Here is a full list of software requirements. When you go to create an app in Shopify CLI, you will be prompted to input some key information about yourself, such as your organization, development store, and the type of app you want to make (here you have the option to build one with a node.js backend and React frontend, or use Ruby on Rails). Shopify will then create your app on the Shopify Partner Dashboard.Take a look at this model from the Shopify website:Next, Shopify CLI will run a tunnel for you with “shopify serve”. Your app is now accessible to the Internet via a “https” port, which is an authentication requirement for Shopify. This will then tunnel your app using ngrok, as well as run your server for local development.So how do you know if it’s working?Shopify CLI has a test function built in: you can populate your app exclusively for testing purposes. If you run the command ‘’shopify populate’’, you can choose to populate your app with products, customers, and draft orders.As the name suggests, the “shopify deploy” command deploys your app to external platforms. Currently, Heroku is the only available external platform, but more are in development (and by the time you’re reading this, might already be available!)Shopify has built many tools to help its partners create apps for the Shopify App Store. That’s just one of the reasons we recently argued it is better to develop apps for Shopify than WooCommerce.Some of the previous command line tools built by Shopify use Node, Go, and Ruby. Shopify ultimately settled on Ruby for the following reasons: Shopify Partners can now use Shopify CLI for apps to safely download, develop, preview, and test changes within development themes before launch. Changes are instantly populated, so you can preview as you go. Once the theme is ready, it can be pushed and published directly from the command line.You can also use CLI together with Shopify GitHub integration to add version control to any themes you’re developing. If you want to take a look at how that works, this tutorial takes you through all the steps of theme development. Let’s run through some functions of Shopify CLI. Once you’ve created a Node.js app, the following commands are available: Shopify is the leading ecommerce platform today, thanks to its 1.7 million loyal merchants, as well as the 6,000 third-party apps currently for sale in the Shopify App Store.Shopify is always striving to create a better, more streamlined process for its developers. Shared values based on accessibility, open communication and innovation is why Baremetrics built our integration for Shopify apps.With our free trial, you can access the best of what both Baremetrics and Shopify have to offer: better app development and full financial insights, all in one place.\n",
      "What Is FinOps and How Can It Help Businesses Scale Their Financial Processes.\n",
      "In recent years, a new discipline of financial management has emerged in response to cloud technologies and organizations growing reliance on cloud IT architectures and cloud-based business processes.FinOps, which stands for Financial Operations, combines the latest technologies and methods to help businesses scale their financial processes adequately and efficiently. In this blog post, we’ll be covering some of the FinOps fundamentals and exploring how FinOps can help businesses optimize their cloud usage and expenditure.Over the previous decade, many companies have embraced cloud-based services. While it has many advantages, one consequence of the general shift towards cloud computing is that without keeping a close eye on them, the fees incurred by cloud service providers can quickly skyrocket.FinOps refers to an operational model for financial management that orients itself towards the optimization of a company’s cloud usage. It includes techniques for monitoring cloud usage, streamlining computing processes, and prioritizing tasks in the most cost-effective way.Cloud-based approaches were once seen as a high-tech solution reserved for cutting-edge IT businesses. These days, more and more companies are using some kind of cloud option in their everyday operations.From the widespread use of secure, off-site data storage, to the growing digitization of business communications, cloud computing is an increasingly ubiquitous feature of modern business.One of the major advantages of the cloud is its scalability. With flexible payment plans and real-time adjustments to service provision available from most cloud platforms, the cloud is helping businesses of all kinds scale up or down as and when they need.From meeting surges in demand for ecommerce to helping to reduce contact center shrinkage, cloud infrastructure’s scalability has been a massive advantage to many industries. But just because the cloud can boost the efficiency of resource usage, doesn’t mean it necessarily does. That’s where FinOps comes in.To ensure that the scalability of cloud computing is actually boosting your company’s financial performance, it is vital that you track cloud usage and implement it efficiently. If not, costs can rapidly escalate and get out of hand.To keep costs down, you should employ a robust FinOps framework that monitors and manages all aspects of your organization’s cloud usage. It is useful to consider a three-stage model of FinOps.You might see the three stages of the FinOps journey referred to as inform, optimize, and operate, a model popularized by the FinOps Foundation. While the inform-optimize-operate system has its place, in order to cut through the jargon, I prefer the terms inform, analyze, and act. Keep in mind that in either model, the three phases do not necessarily demand a linear, chronological journey from beginning to end, but can happen simultaneously and iteratively.The first phase of the FinOps process should always be gathering the necessary data. You will need to compile information on the cloud usage and expenditure of each of your business’s different departments and organize it in an accessible way.The most straightforward way to gather this data is simply to survey all departments within your organization that have some reliance on cloud computing processes. A typical survey might ask questions like what was your monthly cloud expenditure for the last six months? Which cloud service providers do you use? If you use multiple providers, which service does each one provide, and what is the ratio of usage between providers?In sectors that only mobilize cloud computing in an auxiliary capacity, calculating cloud costs is a relatively straightforward task. For some businesses, however, this stage of FinOps can be more complex.For example, SaaS companies might deploy multiple cloud architectures in parallel and rely on more than one cloud service provider to house specific data sets or regulate available features for tiered customers. Because of the potential for complexity in the sector, SaaS businesses that build a transparent data model for their cloud usage tend to perform better and are valued higher by investors.Once you have amassed the necessary usage and cost data, the next step is to calculate how your organization can most efficiently allocate cloud resources to reduce expenditure.A key aspect of the analysis stage of your FinOps program is the prediction of future cloud resource requirements, known as usage forecasting. FinOps teams can use predictive analytics models to estimate what your various cloud resource needs will be for the year ahead, helping you to budget accordingly. Knowing what your expected requirements are can also help you to take advantage of cheaper prepaid resources and VoIP call center solutions offered by cloud providers.As well as predictive analytics, a related but separate branch of data analysis is the field of prescriptive analytics. Rather than being oriented towards the prediction of future usage, prescriptive analytics aims at calculating the statistically optimal course of action based on known data.In FinOps, this means using what is known about cloud resource usage to determine how a given cloud usage framework can be made more profitable. The application of prescriptive analytics can tell you if a certain cloud task is worth continuing, or if it can be optimized by making adjustments to the cloud processes used.With the right FinOps analytics processes in place, you can be confident that you are not overspending on resources at any given time. For businesses that find themselves scaling rapidly, this can prove the be one of the most important factors impacting whether you are able to meet customer demand without breaking the bank.The third stage of the FinOps cycle is the point at which you apply the findings of the information gathering and analysis phases. Actions should be aligned with a holistic business strategy that takes the insights of your FinOps program into account alongside other sources of data and analytics. For example, a cost-benefit analysis of porting number from your traditional PBX system (see what is a PBX phone system?) to a cloud-based alternative will draw upon multiple data streams, not just those generated by your cloud usage.It is best not to think of acting upon the insights of your data gathering and analysis efforts as a final stage, but rather a continuous process of improvement. As such, FinOps best practice involves continuously evaluating the metrics you’re tracking and ensuring they reflect your business objectives and the latest developments in cloud service.Although FinOps has a reputation for using the latest data analytics techniques that include machine learning and artificial intelligence, there is also space for less sophisticated but equally useful technologies within the scope of FinOps.EDI, which stands for electronic data interchange, is one such technology. EDI facilitates the exchange of documents and transactions between trading partners in a standardized electronic format. In order to integrate EDI into your FinOps strategy, make sure you are using a cloud-compatible EDI system.Selecting your EDI platform is actually a very important decision from a FinOps perspective. Some EDI systems lend themselves more to rapid scaling, for example. What’s more, if you process many transactions over EDI, you should also consider whether your system supports multithreading - a feature that accelerates processing times when handling multiple transactions.Adopting a FinOps framework can be a worthwhile endeavor for any company that has to manage cloud expenditure. If you anticipate your cloud usage scaling up any time soon, it is especially important to implement the right processes and principles early on.By integrating FinOps into your overarching business strategy, including your financial modeling and business communications plans, you can optimize your cloud resource usage and ensure you have a clean and reliable data pipeline across your cloud-based processes. Now that you know what FinOps is, and how it can help your business scale its financial processes, all that’s left to do is design and implement a FinOps program of your own.\n"

      "Invoice Financing for SaaS Companies: What Is It & How Does It Work?.\n",
      "It is no secret that in order to grow a SaaS company, business leaders need to consider cash flow. A poor cash flow means limited capital for creating growth opportunities. It can also threaten a small business's ability to keep up with everyday operations. Invoice financing is an excellent option for SaaS companies looking for a fast and easy way to earn a short-term type of funding. With this type of financing, invoices serve as collateral rather than your own assets.That means 0 borrowed money like with traditional loans. Keep reading to learn more about invoice financing, how it works, and the benefits it serves for SaaS companies.Invoice financing is a form of loan that allows organizations to borrow money against outstanding invoices from customers and clients. Perhaps you're more familiar with the terms receivables financing or invoice trading as they are synonymous with invoice financing. Unlike traditional small business loans, customer invoices serve as collateral on the capital you borrow. As a result, many companies find that invoice financing is easier to qualify for because it is not dependent on credit score or other lending minimum requirements. Invoice financing is an attractive funding option for B2B and service-based businesses. Unfortunately, these organizations are more susceptible to cash flow problems because they depend on customers to pay invoices on time. However, companies that rely on invoice trading are paid almost immediately instead of the 30, 60, 90-day payment cycle.Invoice factoring is the most accessible form of financing. It often takes place in three stages. Let's use an example with actual figures to make the process of invoice financing more clear.Company ABC has receivables of $10,000, which are due in 60 days. However, the business needs this money more quickly to effectively grow its operations and pay its employees. As a result, Company ABC works with an invoice financing company to receive the money immediately rather than 60 days. The invoice factoring company reviews the payment history of Company ABC's customer. After verifying the customer's creditworthiness, the invoice is sold to an investor. The investor lends Company ABC 80% of the invoice or $8,000. In 60-days, the customer pays the investor the full $10,000. Once this transaction is complete, the investor returns the remaining 20% and deducts a fee of $200. So overall, Company ABC got to quickly fund its working capital without waiting for customers to pay the money back in 60-days. As a SaaS company, your business model revolves around selling a service. In some or perhaps most scenarios, the transaction is done on credit. In other words, clients don't pay immediately for their purchased services. The customer is given an invoice with the payment plan, including the total amount due and the payment's due date. While this is common practice for most B2B and SaaS agencies, delayed payments often result in cash flow challenges. Your company is left with tied up funds that should be used to invest or grow operations.Baremetrics is partnering with Crowdz, a competitive invoice auction that provides SaaS companies with instant working capital and trade finance resources. The Crowdz Marketplace gives your accounting and finance teams the edge they need to put more money on the books.All invoices are welcome on their marketplace because they understand every dollar counts. Plus, you're able to access cash on the spot as the Crowdz financing platform lets you select which receivables to advance based on your needs.In addition to the Crowdz Marketplace, they also recently launched Recurring Revenue! Here, users are connected with investors who provide capital in return for their ongoing total gross revenue. In other words, companies can advertise invoices and contracts of clients subscribed to their services.Learn more about The Ultimate Funding Solution: Crowdz Recurring Revenue Financing.\n",
      "The Power of Recommendation: 3 Tips on Creating an Effective Referral Program.\n",
      "Positive word-of-mouth acclaim is the most prized form of feedback a business can hope for.Having satisfied users recommend your product to their family, friends, and colleagues proves that you’ve created something great, something literally worth writing home about.Referral programs are a great way to capitalize on user satisfaction: they are both highly effective, and an extremely resource-efficient type of campaign. This type of marketing requires almost no budget nor labor.It does, however, require strategy.(For clarity’s sake, we’re not referring to paid sponsorships, endorsements or affiliate marketing kickbacks. The focus of this article is primarily on non-financially motivated recommendations, though we will be discussing referral bonuses, too.)Word-of-mouth renown is the greatest equalizer for marketing in the tech industry.If you’ve ever run a comprehensive advertising campaign, you’ll know how quickly those costs add up. Start-ups will always be at a disadvantage in the paid advertising space, as larger companies have the budgets at their disposal to purchase top-shelf SEO, run TV ads during the superbowl half-time, and hang branded banners off skyscrapers.If you’re a small-to-medium sized SaaS business, how do you compete with that?If you can’t go big, go personal.Here’s the thing about referrals. Recommendations are intimate in nature, something that as a business, you might feel you cannot possibly influence or control.There is, of course, some underlying truth to this notion. No one is going to make an unpaid recommendation for a product they don’t believe in. The absolute best thing you can do to get users to recommend your product is to make them feel like they’re getting great value. The value trifecta looks like this: your product solves a problem the user faces in their business, their experience with your service and your team is positive, and it comes at a good price.These criteria are of course inherent to your product itself. So how do you encourage word-of-mouth recommendations purely through marketing?Here are 3 tips on how to create a highly effective referral program.If you want someone to recommend your product, make it simple for them! There are a number of ways to make your referral process more accessible to your users.1. VisibilityThere’s a reason why companies that rely on word-of-mouth, views, engagement, or virality display the ‘share’ button so noticeably. This serves both as a suggestion and a reminder. Without such an accessible share function, memes such as this one arguably wouldn’t exist!In contrast, many SaaS websites make the mistake of hiding their referral program somewhere deep in the bowels of their system.Naturally, you don’t want to distract your users from work while they’re using your software. However, any tasks you want them to complete need to actively stay on their radar. Essentially, the referral prompt should be visible within the viewer’s peripheral vision, but not distract from the functionality of the page.You should also send reminders to complete a referral, such as through email prompts or a small pop-up message on the user’s dashboard at given time intervals. 2. SupportIt’s critical that the entire referral process is fast and streamlined so that the user’s workflow isn’t interrupted. The more you can minimize friction during this process, the more users will complete their referrals.There are several ways to stream-line the referral experience:Have the referral screen pop up or be embedded, so that the full action can be completed without clicking away from the user’s current work page.Keep the entire process to a single page.Allow users to send a referral to multiple people at once.Make the process compatible across all popular platforms such as email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Discord, Slack, LinkedIn etc. to maximize potential reach.Offer message templates users can choose from and customize, and also provide the option to input a personalized message of their own. Here are some examples of effective pre-filled template messages.3. ClarityBe specific about what you’re offering in one glance.If you’re offering a referral bonus or discount, give it a specific $ value. In other words, ‘$150 off your annual subscription’ is much more effective than ‘-10% discount’ or ‘get 3 months’ free’.Are you looking for insights into how to attract and retain your ideal customers? Baremetrics provides financial data across 26+ different metrics so you can track churn, lost conversions, and many more indicators of missed business opportunities. Sign up here for a 14-day trial.The gift of a painless process should extend to the person receiving the referral.This person often differs from your typical prospect, and therefore has different needs to cater for. It’s possible that this is their first exposure to a solution like your product, in which case they might require more up-front information and handholding than prospects who have already done some market research before arriving at your doorstep.There are a few ways in which you can reduce friction and incentivize referred prospects to sign up for a trial:Effective campaigns don’t contradict themselves. This might seem like a no-brainer, but in reality it’s a very common mistake to attempt to cover all bases within a single campaign. As a result, the overall message loses its integrity.There are various approaches to soliciting referrals. For maximum potency, it’s essential to pick one and stay consistent to its values.Type 1: Product value-driven referralsIn this type of referral, the user recommends your product simply because they think it could be of value to the person they’re referring it to. There’s no bonus or other material gain to be had, other than the gratification of sharing a great service with someone who could equally benefit from its use.Having your product recommended through value-driven referrals is also a great test for how well you’re doing in your field. There is no financial motivation, so if you’re achieving this type of referral, you know for sure that you’re delivering an exceptional service.The added benefit of this type of referral is that it costs you nothing.Type 2: Reward-driven referralsOn the flipside, there are reward-driven referrals. The message to your user is, ‘refer us and gain X’. The ‘X’ in question can be anything - a cash prize, a gift card for an affiliated product, a discount on your services.Reward-driven programs are more effective if the user can rack up multiple referral bonuses. Some companies even create a multi-level system in which person A not only receives a bonus for referring to person B, but also gets a kickback if person B refers to person C, etc. This system is popular because it can show fast results, however it has a number of significant drawbacks:Type 3: generosity-driven referralsIf you’re finding that despite optimizing your referral process, value-driven recommendations aren’t occurring organically, and the risks of reward-driven referrals outweigh potential benefits to your SaaS company, consider a third option: generosity-driven referrals.Studies into word-of-mouth marketing such as this 2019 experiment have demonstrated that the most successful referral programs emphasize the benefits to be gained not by the referring user themselves, but the person they are referring a product to. Why? For most of us, capitalizing on the attention span of friends and colleagues seems a bit ‘icky’. If there is something concrete for them to gain, however, this transaction feels less like asking for a favor and more like extending an offer.The same experiment shows that referral programs offering bonuses to both the referrer and the referee are highly effective, as long as the wording emphasizes the benefit of the referred person. In other words, ‘invite a friend to give them $20 off, you will get $20 off too’ is by far the most effective version of this message.Whichever approach you decide to opt for, remember the key elements to creating an effective referral campaign: simplicity, immediacy, consistency.Baremetrics helps SaaS services like yours keep track of their business’s financial health.

      "Price Localization Explained: What Is It and How Can Businesses Come Up With a Strategy.\n",
      "Competitive pricing is key to succeeding in a global market. There are now an estimated 213 million registered companies globally, each competing with one another on the basis of service, customer care, and pricing. Price is one of the largest determining factors for consumers in terms of which products and services they buy. Companies know this and try to give consumers the best possible price for their service while maintaining profit. There are plenty of tactics that can be used for this, including price skimming and price localization. Companies that operate over multiple regions or countries are increasingly turning to price localization as a way of bringing in more customers and growing their revenue.  This is particularly useful for SaaS businesses without many brick-and-mortar assets.Price localization is the process of changing a currency or unit price of a product or service depending on a customer’s location. There are two main types of price localization: Changing the display currencyChanging the unit cost of a productChanging the display currency is sometimes assumed to be a cosmetic change, but it can have a big impact. Customers who can browse products, particularly those which will have a sizable impact on their business operations, in their own currency will feel that the company is committed to succeeding in that nation’s market. Additionally, consumers are more likely to trust a site that lists prices in the local currency.Changing the unit price of a product or service is a bit more complicated. Cost of living and working, and the level of competition in an area are two of the major factors that will influence your decision to change prices based on location. The general rule of thumb is: high competition equals lower prices. The opposite is also true. The logic behind this is that in areas dense with competition, your service is likely to struggle without offering low, competitive prices. In areas where there is less or no competition, you can afford to charge higher prices. Price localization can be done on its own or as part of an ecommerce personalization strategy. Ecommerce personalisation is a popular strategy for driving business growth by engaging more with your customers’ needs and giving them a unique shopping experience. Used correctly, price localization can bring new customers into areas where there’s a lot of competition. It can also raise revenue in areas of low competition by charging according to customer need and whether they can easily obtain the same product or service elsewhere in their area. Price localization is also a great addition to your strategy for driving sales with analytics. By gathering analytics data for the location of your customer base, you can develop a solid price localization plan to help drive sales. Your strategy for price localization will depend on the scale and the nature of your business. For example, a business offering contact center software across the Western United States will need to consider factors like varying cost of living, local competition, and urban/rural areas. On the other hand, international cold calling systems businesses operating across 12 countries would need to consider local currency and global differences in service availability.This is the simplest way of introducing price localization into your business model. You can either give your customers the option to switch between currencies themselves or have the website load automatically with the local currency. The former is a great option if your clients are also an international business. Some businesses like to conduct all of their business in the local currency, or they may prefer to use the US Dollar as an international currency. The reason that local currency is a good way to go is that customers feel recognized and valued as an international customer. It can also help to build trust with international customers that their transactions will be secure. There can be a lot of research that goes into price localization but putting the work in pays off. Firstly, you need to research what it is that your customers need based on their location. Price localization works off the premise that clients everywhere want their needs met while accounting for their varied geographical locations. To do this, there are a number of approaches you can take:Secondly, you need to understand global differences in cost of living and of working. The below image shows the cost of living from low (green) to high (red) globally.Price localization using competition only works so well. In areas with a high cost of working and low competition, you may find that you price yourself out of the market by pricing too high. Clients will pay for quality services that meet their needs - as long as they are actually able to. It’s key that you understand market standard cost across countries and regions to price appropriately. Another aspect of research you might consider is understanding what types of metrics measure customer satisfaction. Pricing is a key part of customer satisfaction, so understanding this will help you to see whether your strategy is effective or needs alteration.Social media is a great tool for building long-term customer relationships and keeping yourself attuned to customers’ needs. It also happens to be an effective way of reaching customers based on their location. Although B2B marketing works a little differently than B2C marketing on social media, using the right platform and approach can still make a difference to your sales and income. Consider targeting small businesses on social media that are more likely to rely on their social media presence than on their website for communicating with customers. As an example, consider that you’re running an ad campaign on Facebook for payment management systems for small businesses. Your geographical target is the Eastern United States and the United Kingdom. You can run an ad displaying different pricing models based on customer location. So, for this example, you would want to be offering lower prices in areas of high competition, like New York City or London, and higher prices in areas of lower competition.Customer lifetime value can be greatly improved by interacting with customers in the online spaces that they use the most. You can also use social media as a research tool to find out the different financial needs of your customers Bundle pricing and offering service packages is a great way to leverage price localization. By recognizing the specific needs of each area, you can tailor your bundles locally and price them according to need and competition Let’s use a customer communication system (CCS) company as an example. Imagine that this CCS business targets new startups hoping to set up a communication system with their clients. A startup in an urban area with clients all in a small geographic region might need a system that can cope with lots of conference calling and strained VoIP infrastructure. On the other hand, a startup in a rural area with clients spread across a wide region might need a system that is able to manage on poor internet connection. They may also need cloud solutions to communicate digitally with clients that they cannot easily meet physically.This communications company should look into bundles that meet both of these needs. They should then price these according to customer location and the level of price competition they are likely to face as a result. You might include perks like a small business phone number or a communication consultant to help companies meet their needs. Why are you developing this strategy? Always have the answer to this question in mind while developing your price localization strategy to keep you focused on achieving your goals. For example, if your goal is to increase customers from a particular country by 10%, then you might want to focus on understanding if there are any overarching issues in that SaaS market that you can solve. Additionally, look into offering packages or bundles that are unique to that market and its needs. Also consider average operating costs in that country and the level of competition. If you’re working in a competitive global market, price localization should be a key business process for your company. It can help you to operate competitively and bring in more customers in a given area. Finally, it can help to account for regional cost of working differences and individual business needs in a given part of your market, paving the way for a truly international storefront and beyond.\n"

      "5 Best Tools to Manage Your Paid Newsletter.\n",
      "There are two types of email subscription lists that marketers can build: free and paid. Free newsletters are great to build brand credibility, nurture and retain customers, but they can use resources like time and money without generating revenue. Paid newsletters, on the other hand, involve charging subscribers for your content.For companies, establishing paid newsletters is a more challenging task. They have to produce top-quality or even exclusive content while keeping mailing frequency. But if they succeed, they may connect with leads better and get a considerable extra replenishing of the revenue.In this article, we’ll cover more differences between free and paid newsletters, how to make a paid newsletter more efficient, as well as five powerful tools marketing teams can use. In the case of paid emails, subscribers pay for their newsletter subscription. Payments may be imposed annually or quarterly, but the most common charge for a subscription is a per-month option.Paid newsletters can contain the same forms of content that free campaigns, but this will be more specific, high-quality, and personalized. Paid mailings can include some of the following:exclusive or early access to briefs, industry updates, and forecastspersonalized expert adviceinvitations to closed eventscase studies and learning materials.Paid emails can be indispensable to build brand credibility better. For example, for businesses that sell professional services or complex goods, e.g. law firms or medical consumables suppliers. The price for spreading unverified or outdated content for these companies is extremely high, so they should take care of the materials they send out. As such, content production is expensive, and companies may charge some agreed fees from subscribers.Before signing up for an email newsletter service, you have to think of the outstanding value to provide subscribers with. Typically, it stems from your expertise. For example, niche leaders can share their business experience or market insights. They can organize webinars, strategic sessions, or presentations, and invite subscribers to participate via paid emails.For small companies or start-ups, determining a subject may be more challenging. Still, they might play upon a unique experience or even mistakes and create success stories, case studies, or casebooks for paid mailings.To create an effective paid campaign, you first need a strategy. It should include:mailing frequency and timingnewsletters formatpricing plansselling processand paid newsletters promotions.Content production costs a penny, so you have to calculate PnL - to estimate money benefits and costs to earn them.After you’ve created a mailing strategy, it’s time to figure out the production. To get started, decide how you’ll distribute the work of the following elements of your newsletter: Strategy: set up and track campaigns, take care of your sender domain reputation, create proper email structure, and A\\B test emailsGraphic design: create visuals, including logos, printable reports mockups, and content illustrationsVideo production: storyboards, timelines, sound effects, custom preloaders, etc.Writing: conduct interviews with industry experts, prepare eBooks, edit, and put the text together into a cohesive newsletter. As for content distribution, it’s better to use a newsletter service rather than sending it out manually. The automation software will manage your campaigns and assure mailings safety way better than a marketer who does all jobs by hand.There are many high-grade “newsletter as a service” providers to consider. The most popular tools offer similar features, e.g. drip campaigns constructors, sent email trackers, and detailed dashboards with analytics. So, the choice is mostly a matter of your UX/UX preferences.Give priority to newsletter software with templates libraries as they will ease your day-to-day conversations with leads. And always start with a free trial.

Before purchasing a subscription, double-check if the email automation tool has:email finder and verifier, so you can keep your contact database full and clean from invalid email addressesintegration with CRMs and marketing automation tools; this will save much of your time on transferring data from one system to another a toolkit to conduct email A\\B tests.Finally, don’t forget to put the content value first. This is the key to creating a successful paid newsletter. Mailing software will deliver your email into recipients' inboxes securely and on time. But without sharing high-value content, you can’t expect to get ROI on your efforts.\n"

      "Shopify vs. WooCommerce: the Best Platform for Your Online Shop.\n",
      "Merchants looking to set up shop online are faced with an important choice: which ecommerce platform will best serve their business?For those looking to use their own website, that choice generally comes down to two competing services: Shopify vs. WooCommerce.It’s important to make the right choice of platform early on, because numerous key strategies for development and marketing flow from that decision.Why are Shopify and WooCommerce the two most popular ecommerce platforms?Both Shopify and WooCommerce share certain features that make them invaluable to online sellers. These include an array of third-party apps, plugins, customizable themes, etc.There are some key differences between the two platforms, however.This article will compare Shopify and WooCommerce from the perspective of merchants, including the benefits, common pain points, and compatible third-party offerings of each platform. By the end, you will be able to identify which platform is right for you.Overall, Shopify comes with a bigger price tag. There is a ‘lite’ plan available at $9/month, however, this tier doesn’t include a shop. Merchant plans that do include one are priced at $29, $79, and $299 per month. Shopify’s pricing tiers are determined by which tools are included, and the user’s volume of sales.WooCommerce (powered by Bluehost), on the other hand, offers plans at $13.99, $17.99, and $31.99 per month.Both platforms include tailored enterprise-level plans available upon request.While Shopify offers a free, 14-day trial that gives prospective shopkeepers enough time to build a store, WooCommerce offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.Shopify is a hosted service. Merchants create their shops directly on Shopify’s domain, which means that all hosting fees are included in the pricing. The added benefit of this is speed: thanks to Shopify Oxygen*, this hosting service is also very fast.WooCommerce is not a hosted service; it is built on top of WordPress. This means that merchants must find and pay for a separate hosting service. It’s very easy to open a store on Shopify that looks good and is simple to use, even without a background in engineering or design. Creating an operational shop on WooCommerce, on the other hand, generally requires the expertise of a developerThe two platforms also use different languages. It’s important to factor this into your decision; if your team is proficient in JavaScript and PHP, the common languages of WooCommerce and WordPress, the cost-efficiency and adaptability of this platform might make it the right choice for you.Shopify, however, uses its own native language called Liquid. Its programming is language-agnostic; the main advantage of this is that Shopify Partners can develop apps for Shopify in any language.Shopify and WooCommerce can both scale to any size. Last August for instance, Shopify announced upgrades to the Shopify Checkout that make it possible for a single shop to process nearly 40,000 items in sales per minute.That means that no matter how much your business grows, your ecommerce location can grow with you.All apps developed for Shopify must be accessed through the Shopify App Store, which performs a rigorous vetting process before release.WooCommerce has a non-exclusive plugin shop; these can also be accessed through the WordPress shop, as well as other online locations.How does this affect merchants?Shopify’s vetting process ensures that every app in the Shopify App Store is safe to use.Listing compatible apps all in the one place also means that they are easy to find - with over 6000 publicly available apps, this accessibility is a really important advantage.WooCommerce and WordPress, on the other hand, are open ecosystems, which means users need to search across multiple shops to find all available plugins and filter out the incompatible ones themselves (and there’s a lot to sift through: the WordPress shop offers approximately 1,000 plugins with the keyword “WooCommerce” in the title, the WooCommerce homepage lists around 500 more, and the top external marketplace for WooCommerce plugins touts another 2000).Overall, the two markets are comparable in size and variety. In terms of simplicity of access and safety, however, Shopify easily wins out. Revenue share refers to the %  cut paid to the ecommerce platform for hosting your shop. Aside from their overheads and development costs, this % also goes to advertising the platform and your store with it - while this cut might seem like a sunk cost, it actually goes a long way towards boosting your sales.WooCommerce uses the term “product net revenue”, which equates to revenue less discounts, returns, affiliate costs, processing fees, and taxes. WooCommerce charges a 30% revenue share on said product net revenue. Until this year, Shopify charged a 20% off revenue. At their 2021 Unite conference, Shopify announced a drastic reduction of their revenue share. Presently, Shopify charges 0% revenue share on the first $1,000,000 sold per year, and 20% thereafter. This excludes their processing fee.Here’s a quick chart illustrating what that means for your business across different bands of revenue:Revenue in $WooCommerceShopifyDifference500,000150,0000150,0001,000,000300,0000300,0001,500,000450,00075,000375,0002,000,000600,000150,000450,000While revenue share alone doesn’t determine which option is cheaper (remember to factor in the monthly subscription and processing fees), Shopify’s lower % cut could save your business a small fortune. To earn an equivalent amount on WooCommerce, you’d have to rake in an extra 30% in sales.*The WooCommerce guidebook for developers is very comprehensive. It provides extensive information about how to develop apps, troubleshoot errors, etc. Their guide, however, doesn’t provide any guidance on how to market your app, track its growth, etc. The material is also fairly dry and dense, without real illustrations of how the process works. If your dev team is new to building plugins, this guidebook might be difficult to followHow to Build a Shopify App: The Complete Guide, on the other hand, delivers on its promise to provide an entry-level tutorial into online store-building. It is a beautiful, interactive compendium of everything you will need to develop an app for Shopify. Actually, it provides everything you need to become a full-fledged app developer for Shopify. The guidebook doesn’t end at the release of your app, either. The tutorial goes on to explain app vetting, entering plugins into the Shopify App Store, marketing, and how to use the AARRR pirate metrics system with Baremetrics to track growth.The Complete Guide also provides beautiful graphics throughout, demonstrating each step visually. It’s a much simpler guidebook targeting more entry-level dev teams. For an overview of this guide, check out our recent summary of the key points here.We’ve recently written about some of the tools available for building Shopify apps. Many of these are generic tools that can be used to develop any software, while others are specifically released by Shopify for internal use. Along with the aforementioned Hydrogen and Oxygen tools,Shopify CLI is another tool develope by Shopify. It helps you build apps by quickly generating Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PHP apps, app extensions, and so on.So, which platform is better for your business?Shopify is generally regarded as the more user-friendly option, but this ease of use comes at the cost of customizability (Shopify Hydrogen* may soon change that, however). Conversely, WooCommerce is usually seen as the better option for merchants who are more experienced with WordPress and app development.Ultimately, the better choice for you will be determined by what type of merchant you are, and the kind of users you’re hoping to attract.Overall, Shopify provides the better ecommerce ecosystem, which means that it has the better prospective client base. That means more revenue for you, and the zero percent revenue share means you get to keep more of your earnings.\n",
      "Cash Flow Modeling for SaaS: 6 Tools to Use in 2022.\n",
      "It’s that time of year, where we make lists of everything that happened in the current year and more lists about next year! This article is one such list, where we take a deep dive into cash flow modeling for SaaS businesses and the software that can help you do it. Cash flow modeling is a necessary but complicated task. You take all of your assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investments, etc. and project them into the future. That way you have a good idea about how your cash position will change from month to month or year to year.These projections are built on many assumptions, from your hiring plan to your expected monthly recurring revenue (MRR) growth. If that’s not hard enough, good cash flow modeling takes into account scenario planning to provide various different projections, from overly conservative to highly optimistic.Thankfully there are many cash flow modeling packages out there to streamline cash flow modeling. In this article, we are going to summarize the six tools you should consider for cash flow modeling in 2022.A cash flow model is a dynamic picture of everything in your business that can affect your cash position today or in the future. If you aren’t sure what can affect your cash flow, take a look at your statement of cash flows.Cash can flow into your company in several ways. For example, you can sell services that lead to revenue coming in, you can put more money into the company as owner’s equity, or you can take out a bank loan as a new liability.Cash can also flow out of your company in many ways. For example, you can pay your hosting bill, which is an expense, or you could pay back a bank loan, which is reducing liability.Unlike revenue, where more is basically always better, and expenses, where lower is basically always better, cash in is not necessarily good and cash out is not necessarily bad. However, not having a good idea of how much money is entering or exiting your business over time is always bad! That leads us to our next question:Cash flow is an extremely important part of your SaaS financial model, especially if you are bootstrapping. Companies are far more likely to go insolvent than bankrupt. That is, they are far more likely to run out of the cash needed to deal with things day to day despite being profitable than to fail due to being unprofitable. The single best way to prevent insolvency is to keep one eye on cash flows all the time.In addition, understanding your current and future cash flow allows you to determine realistic growth goals, improve your budgeting, and work with your salespeople to set goals. Given both the importance and the complexity of cash flow modeling, you should use cash flow modeling software to reduce the amount of effort involved in these predictions. By using software with an AI algorithm or other automation, you can improve the accuracy of your financial model while saving precious time. Let’s take a look at exactly what it is that cash flow modeling software does.Cash flow modeling software lets you use historical data from a previous time period to develop a forecast of your incoming cash from revenue. For SaaS businesses, you can start with your MRR growth and revenue churn. From there, you’ll need to get a good idea of your current expenses and how they will change over time. While reasonable assumptions about revenue and expenses are a good start to understanding how your cash flow will change over time, cash flow modeling includes many other components, from putting equity into the business or taking it out to opening or closing liabilities.We’ve previously discussed creating a financial model that encompasses cash flow, operations, revenue, and forecasting. In that post, you’ll find everything you need to create a financial model that helps you operate your business. Leveraging cash flow modeling software will help you simplify this process even further. If you’re trying to weigh your options for cash flow modeling software, you will probably come across a few options in your search. Here are some popular cash flow modeling software options in 2021, with pros and cons for each.  Baremetrics offers financial reporting tools designed specifically with SaaS and ecommerce businesses in mind. Baremetrics has a reporting dashboard that includes all the essential metrics for SaaS businesses. Now, Flightpath by Baremetrics brings a whole new level of financial modeling capabilities. Flightpath allows you to forecast your revenues, expenses, and cash flow, giving you better visibility into your company's future. Flightpath is incredibly hands off, if you want to be. By inputting your balance sheet and profit and loss statement information, it can automatically generate your statement of cash flows.Then, you can add any assumptions you want to get cash flow models of the future. Or, you can let Flightpath run on autopilot and show you the future based on its algorithmic assumptions of revenue growth, expenses growth, and more.Here’s what dashboards look like in Flightpath.Flightpath provides a mix of software and expert-level finance support. Plans start at $1,000 per month which includes onboarding support and quarterly forecast reviews. Float is a popular add-on that works in tandem with online accounting software like QuickBooks Online, Xero, and FreeAgent. Float works by importing transaction data from these sources.The downside of Float is that it does not integrate directly with payment processors that work for recurring payments. Instead, it relies on accounting data. For SaaS and ecommerce businesses dealing with a high volume of transactions in a given time frame, the most accurate forecasting comes directly from transactional data. Depending on the size of your business, Float costs from $59 to $199 per month. Here’s a look at their cash flow model:For businesses using QuickBooks for accounting and invoicing, there is a cash flow forecast report available. You can define different data points that impact your business model and revenue projections to create your revenue forecasting report, including your accounts receivable, bank account balances, and credit card ledgers. Once the report is generated, revenue projections can be adjusted using historical data from any time window of your choice by adjusting the date range. When using QuickBooks, you have to generate your reports manually. If your accounting processes aren’t fully automated, you won’t always have the most accurate revenue forecasting when you use QuickBooks. The price to get access to QuickBooks advanced features is $180 per month. Here’s an example of their cash flow dashboard:Pulse is one of the most robust web app options for revenue forecasting. Because Pulse is entirely dedicated to revenue forecasting, it’s a popular SaaS product for sales forecasting, cash flow forecasting, and budgeting. The forecasting methods Pulse uses require you to input your sales data manually, or you can upload an Excel spreadsheet. It does not integrate directly with any other accounting software or payment processors, which makes it time-consuming and leaves the potential for human error. That said, once the data is input, Pulse does have extremely impressive options to break down your report in a variety of views and determine what works best for your business needs. Pulse has two pricing tiers, at $59 per month for small businesses and $89 per month for the full package. Pulse also offers a free trial. Here’s the summary page for their cash flow modeling:Planful offers many products including cash flow modeling and management tools. Their major selling points are the customization level offered. Not only can you customize the data in and forecast out, but also the UX/UI and how the information is visualized.The model manager shows you your dynamic budget at a glance. The key goal of their software is to remove the need for any coding or scripting so that the manager can do all of the work without calling IT for help. On the downside, customer service is gated by a chatbot, which can make it difficult to get help when needed. The pricing information is not listed, so you’ll need to give your personal information and run a whole demo to find out the price.Here’s the limited view of the app they provide without booking a demo:Vistr is a web app designed to help users monitor the money going into and out of their company. It offers simple premade options as well as the ability to customize the model to include anything the user chooses.There are quite a few tools available including tax forecasting and flags that tell you when payments are expected so you know if they are coming in late. However, Vistr wasn’t specifically designed with SaaS businesses in mind, so it can be tricky to deal with recurring revenue.Vistr is currently free for all users, but they intend to add more advanced features that will be bundled together into a paid subscription. Here’s a look at their dashboard:If you need to invest in your business’s operations, hire additional team members, or make a purchase, you need to know if you’ll have the liquid resources available. When you have a clear understanding of your cash flow, you can make important decisions about budgeting and sales goals.After reviewing six of the best cash flow modeling software packages available today, Flightpath by Baremetrics comes out ahead as the most comprehensive and the one best designed to handle the special requirements of SaaS businesses.If you're looking for profit and loss, cash flow, balance sheets and business metrics all in the same tool, look no further.

      "What Is Optional Product Pricing and How to Use it Successfully.\n",
      "Optional product pricing often employs the concept of a loss leader. Loss leaders are products that are sold below market value in order to encourage consumers to buy more products in the long term. As a classic example, gaming consoles are often sold at a loss. Over the years following the initial purchase, gamers need to buy games at a mark-up, which is where the real profit comes from.Gaming companies and other manufacturers of physical goods are typical adopters of the loss leader strategy, but they are far from the only ones. Optional product pricing is also regularly employed by many SaaS enterprises today.In this article, I will go over the optional product pricing strategy, illustrate its pros and cons, and provide you with some real-world examples of this strategy in use.By the way, Baremetrics can help you measure the effect of a new pricing strategy in a few clicks. Sign up for a free trial or check out our demo to map the effects of pricing changes, without disrupting your users.Optional product pricing is a common pricing strategy among businesses that have one main required product, accompanied by many “optional products”. “Optional’’ is in inverted commas because, as we’ll see in some use cases below, oftentimes these aren’t exactly optional at all.In order to maximize total revenue, some companies choose to charge separately for each product. The main product is usually priced low or even at a loss (hence the name, ‘loss leader’) to encourage buyers to purchase the main product over its competitors. Once they’ve bought into the system, customers may soon find that they need to buy further services or accessories to get the most value out of the product. Companies can charge more for these add-ons because the user is already locked into using the core product.This system is founded on a concept known as sunk cost. Essentially, most users choose the cheapest available option for the initial purchase, failing to take into account the long-term costs of necessary accessories.The opposite of optional product pricing is bundle pricing. In bundle pricing, individual features and accessories are sold altogether for an aggregate price. As a company offering a service, bundle pricing is the better option when the accessories are not needed in order to get good value from the core product. Bundling add-ons into the main price allows users to trial tools they may not have used otherwise, and ensures that your development costs for additional features are covered.Somewhat ironically, optional product pricing is best adopted when the product’s accessories are in fact not optional at all.For optional product pricing to work for you, you need a minimum of two products: the primary product, and at least one complementary feature.Furthermore, these components should possess certain traits in order for optional product pricing to be successful. Let’s take a look at them.The primary product should be the most expensive component. Its features should be the main selling point of the overall service. It should also be somewhat incomplete without the other products, without deceiving its users about its functionality.In this instance, incomplete can mean anything from a gaming console without games, to a fully functional but limited platform that requires plugins or apps to extract the most value from its use. While the former is overtly incomplete and unusable by itself (you need games for your Nintendo), the latter isn’t (while WordPress is perfectly usable without plugins, most users will eventually accumulate quite a few). It’s critical that in neither case the user feels that they’ve been lied to about the need for complementary products, and the focus remains on the excellent value they’ve received for the core product.The most successful cases of optional products fall under two categories:With this strategy, you can make enough optional product sales to compensate for the lower price on the main product.While plane tickets are not cheap, discount airlines have slashed their prices by making you pay extra for everything—added leg room, checked bags, use of the overhead compartment, drinks, food, priority boarding, seat choice, and whatever else they can think of.This gives the discount airlines the ability to appear much cheaper than the main carriers, while possibly charging you more in the end. Slack, Shopify, WordPress, and so many other beloved SaaS platforms have opened up to third-party developers. Offering a SaaS platform for much less than the fair market value—or even for free—has become a great way to attract a huge user base. Those same users can then be offered costly plugins to improve their experience. In doing so, the owner of that service can boost revenue through complementary services. If additional plug-ins or cross-platform compatibility solutions aren’t part of the initial revenue percentage agreement between the owner and investors, these types of incidental services can actually become far more lucrative than the core product for the developer, as they might be raking in upto 100% of this part of the profits.If you are in a highly competitive market, you might not be able to directly charge enough for your software to earn profit. In that case, optional product pricing can be a great way to get customers in the door. Once they are hooked on your platform, you are free to charge a bit more for all the extras that provide them with added value.Optional product pricing really only works when the optional products aren’t all that optional in reality. It also works best when you have a lot of optional products. If customers decide they don’t need or want the optional products, then you might find yourself priced at a loss and burning money fast.Many SaaS businesses find themselves choosing between bundle pricing and optional product pricing. The right choice comes down to what your customers require from your services.Try to figure out whether your users can live without your add-ons. You can do this through user surveys, or feature experiments among new users (avoid disrupting your existing user base as much as possible!). If your users need several of the additional features you offer, consider adopting an optional product pricing model. If you want to take a look at how your cohort is pricing their plans, Baremetrics offers benchmarks for many different types of metrics, including how many businesses in your field offer free plans, how their prices are presented, average subscription amounts, and much more.\n",
      "How to Identify Customers at Risk of Churn.\n",
      "Reducing churn is the single most important thing your SaaS company can do to improve its growth. By some estimates, it is up to 25 times cheaper to keep a customer happy than to onboard a new one. So how do you identify customers at risk of churn? In this article, I will list a series of actions you can take to identify cohorts of customers most at risk of churn. I’ll also give you positive actions you can take to reduce and even prevent customer churn. By the end, you will have all the tools you need to reduce churn at your SaaS enterprise. Before I get into how you can identify customers at risk of churn, let’s quickly go over what churn is and how to calculate it. Churn is basically the speed at which you lose business. It is usually represented as a percentage. There are two kinds of churn: revenue churn and customer churn.Let’s take a look at each of them.Revenue churn is the amount of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) you are losing due to cancellations and downgrades each month. You can calculate revenue churn using the following equation: Note that Churn MRR is the MRR lost from cancellations, while Contraction MRR is the MRR lost from existing customers due to downgrades.While I’m focusing on customers in this article, it is important to consider revenue churn too because not every customer is equally valuable to your company. When you have limited resources, you should always focus on the most valuable customers.Baremetrics provides a broad overview as well as daily breakdowns into revenue churn. Take a look:Customer churn is the percentage of customers that are leaving your service per month. It can be calculated using the following equation.Fundamentally, your goal with customers at risk of churn is to keep them using your product. You can do this by targeting the right customers in the first place, providing them with a high quality of service tailored to their needs, and continually tracking their user behavior looking for indications of displeasure. I will address these actions in order, so that by the end, you will have an effective strategy starting with marketing and continuing on through the entire customer lifetime.  Do you have a well-defined ideal customer profile (ICP)? If you don’t know what that is, stop and check out the article. You should be planning your entire marketing strategy around a specific ICP.If your product has broad appeal, developing multiple specific ICPs is better than one ICP that is too broad. By refining an ICP and targeting only prospects who match this profile, you will curb your churn rate before your customer even signs up.That’s because the right customers will be able to extract the most value from your product. So long as customers are profiting from your app, they will remain subscribed.Starting from the moment you get a lead, you should be using all the tools at your disposal to encourage customers to integrate your product into their business processes. During the free trial period, start sending emails to your prospective clients pointing out interesting features, explaining how to use your platform, and nudging them back to your site to give the tools a try.By getting your clients to use the features of your SaaS product to their full potential early and often, you guarantee that they are getting as much value as possible from your product. Keep track of all the available user behavior data. This information lets you know which  features your users are getting the most value from. Your marketing, sales, and customer success teams should be engaging with your clients on a regular basis and encouraging them to interact with your platform.Meanwhile, your data analytics and dev teams should be tracking and mapping out how users interact with your platform. This helps your dev teams optimize the parts of the platform that are most used. This process is an invaluable feedback loop: Some customers will realize that your product simply isn’t for them, and choose to leave. However, a proportion of customers actually churn involuntarily. Involuntary churn occurs when a customer leaves your platform not by choice but because of another issue, such as a credit card payment failure.Baremetrics’ Recover tool can help you prevent involuntary churn by activating automatic processes to get clients to go back and fix their payment issues. Take a look:Keeping an eye on unopened credit card details through update emails can help you identify customers that are at risk of churn. You can then execute other strategies to push users back towards actively using your product.Recover automates your dunning process so you never have to worry about losing customers involuntarily. Recover’s payment processor can be fully integrated into your Baremetrics dashboard. The best part? It pays for itself - on average, Recover makes back 38x what it costs. Try it as part of your Baremetrics free trial today.Not every customer is the same, however, groups of customers who share certain characteristics such as geographic location, or choice of subscription tier, exhibit similar user behavior.Working with these cohorts separately can help you develop re-engagement plans that will work best for each individual group. For example, if your customers in America seem to be more active than those in Canada, you can try and figure out why the Canadians are not getting as much value out of your platform.Baremetrics Segmentation can do all of this for you. Take a look:A: Churn risk is a measure of how likely a customer is at risk of churning. By segmenting your users into low, medium, and high risk of churn, you can focus your attention on the clients that need it the most. A: Yes! You should absolutely try to save every customer you can from churn. By some estimates, it is up to 25 times cheaper to prevent a current customer from churning than it is to onboard a new customer. You should try to identify every customer at risk of churn and communicate with them to figure out how you can prevent that from happening.A: I have gone through a series of actions in this article that you can take to prevent a customer from churning. You start by finding the right customers—the users that will get the most value out of your app. Listen to their needs to reduce pain points and provide users with the best experience of your platform possible.Finally, implement a great dunning process with Baremetrics Recover to put an end to involuntary churn.The principles of business growth are simple: sign up and retain as many customers as possible.The more you can learn about your customers and how they interact with your product, the better you can retain happy customers.Baremetrics offers more than 26 separate metrics to track and segment your user information. These tools can help you adapt your product to customer needs, reduce churn among current users, and identify and attract your ICPs. Try it for yourself with a free, 14-day trial.\n"

      "How to Get More from Shopify Analytics.\n",
      "With a huge number of analytics options out there for Shopify sellers, it can easily feel like you’re not making the most out of the data you have available to you. Whether you’re a Shopify store owner – or are supporting sellers as a Shopify Partner – you probably ask this question quite often: How do I get more from my Shopify analytics? And clearly, there’s no shortage of add-ons and integrations to help you gain more data, and more insights from your data. With Shopify analytics, it’s easy to go BIG. However, as any successful ecommerce professional knows, bigger doesn’t always mean better. The danger is that you fall into what we sometimes call the Big Data Trap – when the time and resource spent managing the data we have available to us is greater than the actual benefit we derive from that data. So today, we also wanted to talk about going small with your data. In particular, once you’ve explored all the data you have available to you, how do you focus on the data that matters? How do you make it tight, meaningful and actionable – so it becomes genuinely useful in driving key business decisions?But first, let’s quickly recap on how to get more useful data...Shopify analytics itself has many of the most important metrics you will likely need, especially when you include the customer reports and marketing reports available to those on premium Shopify plans. Undoubtedly, bottom-line metrics (like Total Sales and Average Order Value) or funnel metrics (like Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate) will continue to form the bread and butter of your ecommerce reporting.That said, you are definitely going to want to make the most of other free analytics options you have available to you. Especially Google Analytics and Google Search Console. If you don’t know how to add Google Analytics to Shopify, here’s a quick guide on how.With Google Analytics you will receive access to a host of granular data you can use to understand user behaviour on your site. Especially with the new Google Analytics 4, which is built around event tracking and engagement, making it easier to slice and dice your customer journeys. Just be aware, Google Analytics and Shopify Analytics don’t always match up. This is because of differences in the way the two platforms collect and report on data. It’s not necessarily anything to worry about, but it’s important to know, especially when things don’t quite tally. Search Console on the other hand helps you understand how you are performing on Google’s search engine itself, giving actionable insight into where your Search traffic comes from, how well you rank, and for which keywords. It’s genuinely surprising just how many new Shopify stores have set up Google Analytics but not Google Search Console.It’s a must. If you’re interested in how to better utilize Search Console for Shopify, here’s a helpful blog from Carlson. If you are using advertising platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook or LinkedIn, you will already be aware how these give you access to another layer of useful analytics. What many don’t know is that some advertising platforms can give you access to useful data, even if you don’t intend to pay for advertising. For example, Google Ads Keyword Planner is hugely useful for anyone researching organic search campaigns. LinkedIn Campaign Manager, on the other hand, provides you with a treasure trove of rich demographic data on the people visiting your site. Many ecommerce businesses overlook this free tool (particularly if they are B2C and wouldn’t necessarily use LinkedIn for their comms or advertising). First, you need to set up the LinkedIn Insight tag (you can use Google Tag Manager). Then you need to set up some matched audiences, (for example, visitors to your homepage, or visitors to your whole site). Once a matched audience reaches 300 users or more, you can start to explore the data. It’s a helpful way of understanding exactly who is browsing your content, in demographic terms. For example – are the people looking at your luxury jewelry store CEOs with fat wallets or a bunch of cash-strapped students? As we can see, even a limited set up for your Shopify store gives you access to thousands, if not millions of individual data points. And that’s the problem. For most Shopify sellers, the hard part is not just about accessing useful analytics, it’s about boiling it back down to a meaningful diet of data that can actually support everyday business planning and decisions.   So how do you attain that focus? How do you go small?Whenever we work across a complex process or system, we normally have a mental model of how that process works in the real world. A very simple example of a mental model would be the concept of supply and demand. If we see demand go up, we know that this affects the decisions we can make with supply – we can buy more stock or raise prices. The mental model you have for your store is partly informed by the nature of your business, and partly informed by you, your priorities, and your entrepreneurial style.As a result, everyone’s mental model for how their business runs is slightly different. And that’s fine. But if you want data to inform your decision making, you need the data to fit your mental model, not the other way around. Unfortunately, many ecommerce professionals feel they need to accept the standard models they are presented with. For example, Shopify builds much of its analytics presentation around AARRR (otherwise known as pirate metrics) , which stands for If this particular type of sales funnel works for you, then great. But don’t be afraid to say if it doesn’t. After all, how likely is it that the same sales funnel works the same for every company or product? Think about impulse purchases vs products where buyers spend months researching. Think about one-off purchases vs products we buy regularly. (In fact, the whole concept of the standard sales funnel has been called into question by marketers in recent years.)I would say it’s better to build bespoke funnels which make sense for your business. What is the process customers actually follow to end up at your store? How long does it take? Where is the emphasis? What are the moments of truth? When you break this down, you begin to appreciate – and start focusing in on – the metrics that are most important to you. One way to create a meaningful distinction between your data is to consider the difference between “monitoring metrics’ and “performance metrics”. 1. Monitoring MetricsMonitoring metrics, sometimes called health metrics, are about reporting on what’s normal. Aside from giving you peace of mind, they are of relevance only when they indicate something has changed. You can establish monitoring metrics by asking yourself the simple question: The benefit of establishing monitoring metrics is that once you have determined them, you can track a large number of them, without having to use much of your day-to-day mental bandwidth, because you only take action if they are behaving strangely. A regular but cursory glance, and they become as instinctive as checking the time. 2. Performance metricsWhereas with performance metrics (or KPIs), you have actively decided these are important, because they indicate the progress you have made towards your business goals. Setting good KPIs takes time, but if you do this well, and set a small, manageable number of KPIs, you can devote more of your mental bandwidth when using them to improve the overall performance of your store. With both performance metrics and monitoring metrics, the point is that you are being intentional about the metrics you are tracking, why you are tracking them, and the degree to which you need to act on them. The worst case scenario is that you track any and all metrics indiscriminately, spreading your attention so thin it becomes pointless to track any.Be intentional and consistent in the time frames you use to appraise your analytics. Of course, when you are using analytics to run exploratory or investigative analysis, it can be helpful to zoom in and out of time periods. However, when you are integrating data into day-to-day business operations, it’s not helpful to keep changing the time frames.Again, this is partly about managing your own bandwidth. Suppose you regularly monitor a key metric like Average Order Value, which has some natural variance, but often tends to a point. You will want to set parameters which are short enough to indicate meaningful change, but aren’t so short they don’t take into account natural variance. Once you’ve found the sweet spot, and report on it regularly, you build up a familiarity with the shape and nature of that metric. You develop almost a sixth sense for when it’s behaving unusually. Whereas if you constantly change the time frames, you don’t build up that same familiarity. You spend much more mental bandwidth working out whether the recent changes require further attention or not. Most in-built analytics platforms will visualize your data, but that’s not the same as making it visible. It’s important that everyone in your team (most of all, you) has regular sight of what is going on. Making your data as visible as possible creates feedback loops, which can inform thinking and decision making. But with a standard Shopify analytics set up, each member of your team is required to log in to each platform, and spend time with the data in order to get any meaning from it. In reality, people have other priorities, and it never happens. Worse, the problem is exacerbated if your KPIs are spread across multiple platforms. Many Shopify users can solve this problem by bringing the data to the team, in the form of a live KPI dashboard. These overview dashboards pull data from different sources and visualize your most important metrics, in a way that makes sense to you and your team. What’s more, these dashboards are designed to be visible, with sharing features that mean you can automatically display the dashboard where everyone’s attention already is – be that Slack, email, mobile or a TV screen on the wall. At Geckoboard, we believe the most transformative thing a business can do with their data is to get it in the right hands, so it informs everyday decisions. It’s not about expensive data warehousing or predictive, AI-powered tools. It’s about entrepreneurs and business leaders gaining greater access, understanding and awareness of their data. So if you want to be a data-driven Shopify superstar, don’t just ask yourself how you can get more data – ask yourself how you can get less.\n"

      " Currently, I'm unable to find any SaaS conferences happening in December 2023. Keep checking back, however, as schedules continuously update!\n",
      "The Art of Upselling: How to Charge More Without Alienating Your User Base.\n",
      "Nailing the ideal price point for a SaaS product is equal parts art and science.Pricing a SaaS product presents a set of challenges different to that of physical goods. Costs, revenue, and perceived value fluctuate considerably in response to a rapidly changing market.Used to your advantage, market reactivity allows small changes in pricing to greatly affect MRR within a short time window. This also means, however, that a SaaS business is more susceptible to changes in the market, notably pertaining to the pricing of direct competitors.Pricing isn’t something to set and forget: it’s imperative to adjust periodically, to mature alongside your product and its market.Consider this: your product might be selling well at its current price point, but is there a different price at which it could be performing better? If you’re offering a tiered service, is there room to upsell?Running a price analysis is the most reliable method for establishing whether your current pricing maximizes MRR.Remember too that if you need to change something about your business fast, there is no other component of a SaaS business more quickly adaptable than pricing.Even if you’re not considering implementing price changes right now, it’s best to be prepared for when you may have to. Consider the following scenarios:Overhead costs increaseThe business requires new hires, or additional benefits for existing staffYour financial forecasting proved over-optimisticYou’re preparing to sell or pitching for investment, and need to boost short term MRR to increase bidsYou simply want to increase your profit margin (and more power to you, we say!)So what happens when you need to adjust your prices? How do you go about upselling your customers whilst maintaining high user satisfaction?Here’s a guide to charging more.Looking for insights into pricing and other financial metrics? Baremetrics has got you covered! To access a detailed breakdown of your MRR, ARPU, customer LTV and much more, give Baremetrics a spin today by starting a free 14-day trial.There’s no shortage of methodologies for setting prices. Boiled down to basic components, it all comes down to costs incurred and value provided.In order to nail pricing, it’s essential that you understand the principles that underpin these equations, so here’s a quick refresher.Sussed out the principles and want to crunch some numbers instead? Check out this neat calculator!Cost-based pricing asks, ‘how much revenue does the business need to run?’This is traditionally based the following formula: It should be stressed, however, that this formula should also include a rainy day fund as well as a margin of error in financial forecasting. Even your ‘lowest possible price’ calculations should make room for financial hiccups, otherwise you might quickly land your business in hot water.Once you have established what your targeted total revenue is, you can break it down:Let’s say you’re targeting a monthly total revenue of $10,000, and your SaaS has 100 users. Therefore, you need to be charging each user on average $100 / month.This price is an average across all service tiers, also known as Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).You’ll have noticed that the ‘target profit margin’ in this formula is self-determined. This is significant: your users create the market dynamics that ultimately determine revenue and profit. Setting your own target percentage, however, is a crucial step towards realistic goal-setting. Aiming for a profit margin that is too low can quickly lead to disappointment and burn out. Aim too high, on the other hand, and you might not be able to sell your services at all.This is where considering a second approach, value-based pricing, comes in.Value based pricing asks, ‘what is my product worth to my customers?’The value of your product is underpinned by the needs and means of your users. It’s on this foundation that your brand is built, and where your ad copy and marketing strategies should draw inspiration.Where does your product fall within its market sector?On the one hand, you infer the value of your product through its price.On the flipside, the market will pass its own verdict. Imagine throwing a paper plane - which direction you toss it in is entirely your choice, but wherever the wind is blowing towards is where it will travel the farthest. Adapting to the market is as important in pricing as it is in any other facet of your business.Examining pricing from both a cost-based and value-based point of view will help you determine:As long as you know that, you have a solid foundation in place for raising your prices without alienating your clients in the process.Aside from simply raising prices, there are a number of ways to charge your existing users more:Why is upselling so important?The main advantage of targeting expansion revenue from upselling is that you know that you’re selling to people who already like and use your product.In addition, the marginal added cost of selling to an existing customer is far lower than acquiring a new customer.Active upselling entails convincing users to upgrade to a higher price plan. As an example of tiers, here’s Zoom’s pricing page:An effective pricing page emphasizes the features, advantages, and benefits analysis of the product. For tiered service plans, this means delineating clear distinctions between the offerings of each tier.The same principle applies to upselling. Lead with positives. In other words, showcase all the new features, extra support, and possibilities for growth the user can gain from moving to a higher level of service.If a user hesitates to upgrade, offering a free upgrade trial or promising a simple downgrade process is a great way to assuage fears. This ‘no pressure’ sales tactic also protects your business-client relationship in the long run.Another advantage of tiered pricing is the ability to change each price point individually. This is very helpful for experimenting with prices, within reason of course - you don’t want to overwhelm your prospects with choices.You can also add more categories as needed, as long as each tier remains distinct and the value of higher priced service plans doesn’t begin to appear diluted.While there are many benefits to offering very low-cost or even free service plans for marketing purposes, it’s crucial that this doesn’t begin to eat into your profits. Make sure that ARPU clears the cost threshold at all times.In contrast, unit-based pricing enables a passive type of upselling that requires minimal individualized contact from your team.Essentially, once your user has reached a certain threshold of sales, clicks, or users of their own, they automatically jump to a higher subscription tier.Messaging is key here: when a small business signs up, establish that you’re offering a special rate for small and mediums-sized enterprises (SMEs). When their business enters a new tier, focus on their growth, in particular how their subscription to your services has helped them attain that goal.Offering a la carte features provides your users with the flexibility to pay only for the tools they truly use. As long as your ARPU covers costs, the price of your most basic subscription can be set competitively low.You can set this up in one of several ways, such as offering a menu of add-ons each time a subscription renews, or running occasional discount campaigns for a featured tool.Alternatively, you might offer a usage-based subscription, wherein users are charged at the end of the month only for the tools they actually used. This can work well if your SaaS doesn’t rely on your MRR to be stable and predictable.Flexibility, the biggest advantage of add-on features, is also one of its main disadvantages. New features, whether internal or offering cross-platform compatibility, require substantial R&D funds. If you do consider launching a new tool, make sure to survey your users beforehand to make sure you can recover development costs - sometimes even great ideas don’t pay for themselves.At its very core, ethical upselling relies on honest, two-way communication.Ethical is the operating word here: selling your users on a plan or features they don’t need might grow MRR in the short term, but it will almost certainly lose you their business and word-of-mouth recommendations in the long run.Keeping users happy requires trust. And to maintain that trust, nothing beats honesty.If your costs have gone up, talk to your users and let them know what’s up.Listen to their concerns and be flexible to their needs where you can - the more personal this process feels, the better you’ll be able to protect user satisfaction.Make sure you’re not changing prices too often. If you need to do some price experimentation, do so with prospects. Keep current users on their old price plan as long as you can, and if you do need to hike prices, do so annually at the very most.Remember, upselling is an effective and economical means to increase MRR, but there’s something even more valuable in the long run: a happy customer.A final remark: in this article, we’ve focused on how to raise prices, not lower them. That is because in the history of paying for things, few people have ever complained about prices going down. It’s extremely important to note, however, that the key to MRR growth might actually be to lower your prices, IF revenue gained from new users outweighs revenue lost from the price drop.Baremetrics provides excellent tools for analyzing your user data. If you need help locating the pricing sweet spot for your SaaS business, look no further! Here’s a free trial to get you started.\n"

      "Top 10 Shopify Merchant Pain Points and App Ideas to Solve Them.\n",
      "Shopify has overtaken Amazon as the leading home of ecommerce. Its platform and support are unrivaled, making it the best place to launch an ecommerce shop. However, that doesn’t mean that Shopify merchants don’t have pain points. In fact, Shopify would be the first to admit that Shopify merchant pain points still exist. But one company can only do so much. With over one million merchants using Shopify, there are tons of opportunities that third-party app developers can create solutions for. That’s right. As Shopify app developers, you can help solve Shopify merchant pain points. If you can remove friction from business operations for Shopify merchants, there’s likely a viable market for your product. Keep reading to learn about the top 10 pain points that Shopify merchants experience, as well as app ideas you could build and grow a sustainable business from. If you aren’t already developing apps for Shopify merchants, now is a great time to start. Building Shopify apps has never been easier because Shopify is constantly adding resources for new and seasoned developers.Indeed, more tools are being released daily to help in your quest to be a Shopify app developer. The Shopify App Store is even evolving to make it easier to market your Shopify apps.When it comes to building apps, though, it can be difficult to figure out exactly what kind of app to develop. While your personal experience will be important in deciding the functional area of your app, you really need to look beyond that for the best chance of hitting it big.The best way to position your app to improve the odds of its success is to focus on pain points.Pain points are problems plain and simple. They are issues that business owners regularly experience while performing the daily tasks of running their businesses.Importantly, pain points are problems that cause enough frustration that people are willing to pay to remove them from their lives. Not all pain points are the same. The following are some of the general characteristics of pain points:Most recently, I was having trouble getting all my old smart plugs to connect to my new network. The Alexa app wasn’t doing it automatically, probably because I am cheap and bought WiFi only sockets instead of Bluetooth/ZigBee ones. So I opened up the app store to see if the company that makes the plugs has an app that could work as an intermediary and fix this all for me. They did, now the grow lights for my succulents will turn on and off all winter without my help, and thus a pain point was eliminated.(Yes, really, succulents)I rarely go to the app store in a random search for fun, new, or interesting apps. I have a problem in mind and am looking for a solution. The same is true for Shopify shopkeepers. Merchants don’t go to the Shopify App Store looking for new or interesting functions. They are there because something has gone wrong, and they want a solution. The best way to gain traction for your app is to find these Shopify merchant pain points, understand the problem deeply, and then create an app that solves it. That’s why I am going to give you 10 Shopify merchant pain point categories in the next section for you to solve. Here are 10 Shopify merchant pain points ready for you to solve:A few years ago, ecommerce was a backup channel to brick-and-mortar locations. At that time, it was easy to maintain inventory and keep the availability online up to date as it was part of the normal inventory process of the physical store.Now it is more difficult. It is even more difficult with drop-shipping. Many shop owners will never see their own inventory and so are looking to automate the integration of their drop shipping partners with their Shopify storefront.SEO, social media market, content marketing, and all the other inbound marketing strategies can be rather opaque. It is hard to know what is or isn’t working and why. Sometimes it is even hard to know what is meant by “working”! A major Shopify merchant pain point is improving their visibility and getting better quality leads to their shop.I love Shopify and think it gives shops a clean look out of the box. However, Shopify also has a distinct feel. I regularly open up a store for the first time, think “Shopify”, and then jump to the bottom of the page in search of the “powered by Shopify” text. Not every shopkeeper wants that, and especially for large (deep-pocketed) companies they want to look like they did everything in house but not actually do everything in house.“Porch pirates” are making people less trusting of having their packages sit on the front stoup all day while they work. This has led to more people requesting signatures to get their packages. They then miss the notification, fail to organize a new pick up, and the item goes back to the destination.If only there was some way to predict which packages are likely to be returned to origin!Before the pandemic, the only clothes I bought online were T shirts. Now I’ve gotten used to buying shoes, pants, even jeans online. But they don’t always fit as expected, and I’m quick to return them when they don’t.This has become a normal part of business for clothiers, and apps that make it quick, easy, and cheap are in hot demand.Not everyone is as impatient as me (I checked the location of the Ever Faith ship today to see where a package is…through the Panama Canal and almost in Savannah, GA!), but some are, and they’ll flood shopkeepers with this question.AI apps that can give clear and honest answers will reduce the tickets generated for customer service and eliminate a major Shopify merchant pain point.I have one job—writing. Except, there are the 30 other tasks that seem to crop up and distract me from writing. The same is true for Shopify merchants. They want to spend their day selling merchandise, but they are constantly distracted by other tasks, and many of them could be automated by well-designed apps.About 1 in 20 shoppers will leave a review or rating. They are more likely to do so when motivated by a great experience or anger. That means they won’t all be decent. Pushing more people, especially happy people, to leave ratings is a key to business success in the ecommerce sector. That makes it a great niche for app developers.Whichever Shopify merchant pain point you solve, you’ll need to track the success of your app. That’s why Shopify app developers use Baremetrics. With Baremetrics, you can understand how your apps are doing and where you need to improve. Monitor your revenue and customer behavior like never before with churn rate, conversion rate, and more.

      "Product vs. Product Category: The Challenges of Developing “The Next Big Thing” as a SaaS Start-Up.\n",
      "Every founder dreams of devising a million dollar idea. An idea that has the potential to change the whole SaaS playing field. Not just a new product; the start of a whole new product category.What is a product category, and how do you recognize whether your great idea promises to become a new class of its own?The journeys of developing a product and developing a product category usually start from a similar place. A founder identifies a problem commonly faced by consumers within a specific niche, and decides to exploit this gap in the market by offering a new solution.The key difference between product and product category essentially springs from the existing competition, and how novel a concept this new solution really is.A new product can be measured closely against others already on the market, even if some of its features are significantly different.A new product category, on the other hand, has no direct predecessor or parallel, and thus no existing frame of reference to compare it to conceptually.It might seem like we’re splitting hairs here. ‘How unique is my unique idea’ is a tricky question to answer, especially if you’re currently navigating the nebulous stages of early development.In reality, most million dollar ideas aren’t dreamt up at all; they lie in wait at the end of a particularly long and treacherous path, taunting the dreamer with mirages of success to come. That being the case, defining from the start whether you’re dealing with a product, or product category, might seem like an impossible task that threatens to stunt the creative flow of your conceptualization phase.It’s critical to bear in mind, however, that the journey of developing a product category is not only different in nature that of developing a product, it also exists on a completely different scale.The sooner you can identify whether you’re venturing into the unchartered waters of a new product category, the better you can prepare for its unique challenges and financial burden.If you’re seeking insights into your business, look no further. Baremetrics maps and analyzes over 26 different metrics to help you track all your financial information in one, easily accessible place. Sign up for the free 14 day trial to try it for yourself.Determining whether a solution is a new product, or a new product category, isn’t always straightforward. It requires foresight into your development process, as well as an in-depth understanding of competing services on the market, past and present, notably how they relate to yours.Here are some case studies of groundbreaking technologies to help define the two differing types of development.One of the fastest rising household names of the decade is Zoom. The concept of video conferencing and remote meetings is a familiar one, spearheaded by other well-known services such as Skype and Google Meet (formerly Hangouts).As a service, Zoom falls well within the confines of an existing product category, one known as meeting solutions.What can we learn about its skyrocketing success?Externally to the product itself, recent global circumstances expounded the need for remote video services.But let’s not undersell Zoom’s key features. The developers identified common grievances with its competitors, and offered a product that point for point provided a superior solution: higher quality video, meeting analytics, cross-integration with other workplace networks, easy screen-sharing, and the option to record meetings and play them back at different speeds (allowing for the highly popular shoot-off function to use the service as a platform to host webinars, and other forms of replayable video content).Zoom exemplifies a service that understands its user base by offering a sleek and intuitive solution, with no learning curve, at a competitive price point.The invention of the smartphone, on the other hand, is a prime example of the birth of a whole new product category.The first device to earn the smartphone title was IBM’s Simon Personal Communicator (SPC, or IBM Simon to its friends).This device was unlike anything that came before it, and had the potential to completely revolutionize personal communication. This mobile telephone offered the ability to send and receive faxes and emails, boasted a calendar, clock, scheduling apps, and could even process handwritten information input via a stylus pen.IBM Simon’s technology was so groundbreaking, no-one knew exactly what to do with it. The device actually failed as a product, if measured solely by its lack of financial success. Only 50,000 units were ever sold, and the manufacturers decided to discontinue the model after a mere six months.Who reaped the benefits of this technological breakthrough? Simon’s successors, following years behind on the trail carved out by IBM.None of this is to say that creating a new product category is in and of itself a greater achievement than developing a new product, nor that the journey of product development is any less challenging.Consider the invention of the lightbulb.Technologically, the lightbulb remains one of humankind’s greatest advancements. The concept itself of artificially creating light, however, was hardly a new one: before the lightbulb, there was the candle. Before the candle, there was the campfire.As both the concept of creating artificial light, and equivalent technologies, though inferior, already existed, the invention of the lightbulb is that of a product, not a product category.Why is that differentiation significant?Simply put, there was never a need to convince anyone of the usefulness of light, or educate people on how to correctly use it. The understanding was already there, someone ‘just’ needed to develop the solution.In other words, the main challenges of developing the lightbulb proved to be technological and economical, not one of education, one of product category development’s greatest challenges.1. Education and marketingDo you have a gadget lying around the house that you’ve never used? Despite promising great functionality, you never got the knack of it? Perhaps the manual got lost. Maybe the learning curve was a bit too steep. And now you regret buying the thing in the first place because you’re getting on just fine without it.Whether it’s the instruction booklet for building that fancy centerpiece you saw on Instagram, or the webinar that explains how to properly use the complex CRM software you just bought for your team, most groundbreaking new products and services require an education stage. This breaks down into three phases:This education process is a challenge faced primarily by product category developers, as users have no direct frame of reference to compare this new product type to. As with the case of IBM Simon, it might take years before the public can even grasp the life-changing potential of such a product.The burden of this early marketing and education phase on budget, timeline, and infrastructure needs, is astronomical.Essentially, it’s very hard to convince someone to buy a product they don’t understand. Even though you know how much your service can improve their business, it doesn’t mean that they have the resources to adopt it.Unbeknownst to you, prospects may also have their own barriers to implementation, such as internal company politics or brand loyalties to follow, an inflexibility to add line items in the budget leaving no obvious space for your service, or even labour regulations against replacing manpower with automation.Ultimately, product category development requires developers to be ready to contend with a vast number of unknowns that have little to do with how good the product is.One piece of advice: when you’re pitching your product to prospects and investors alike, piggy-back off what they already know to explain your idea. Familiarity breeds confidence, and shared understanding fosters trust.2. Resources and front-loaded financial burdenIf you find yourself developing a product category, be aware that the nature of the challenges you will face, and the scale of resources required to handle these, are on a completely different scale.As the founder of a start-up, consider this: creating a new product category tends to be 10x more expensive up front compared to product development.Accordingly, the ROI on the other hand can land at 20-100x higher.Here are some questions to ask yourself before launching down the product category development path:3. The double-edged sword of being the early birdIf you develop something great, one thing is for certain. As soon as you gain any kind of traction, the competition will be hot on your heels. Some of those competitors may be large companies with vast resources. Being there first doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be there at the end to cash in on your trail-blazing idea, either; there is a chance that your successors will overtake your development. Even registering patents and product trademarks won’t necessarily give you all the protection you need to fight the bigger fish in the pond, should they decide to follow in your footsteps.The best way to protect yourself from this is to make the most of your lead time on the market.How big and how long your opportunity window for development is will depend on exactly what you’re creating. If you get stuck at any phase, consider yourself a sitting duck for your competition. Don’t let this discourage you!But do be aware that unlike product development where investment can drip in over time, product category development requires you to have access to vast resources from the start so that you can maximise your first-mover advantage. 4. The benefits of developing a product categoryChallenges aside, there are a number of attractive benefits to creating a new product category other than the chance of attaining exponential ROI.Having no frame of reference leads to one unusual advantage: you don’t need to prove that you’re better than the competition, because there is none. Until they catch up, that is, which is when all the traditional challenges of product development kick in.By then, hopefully you will have maximised your leader advantage, and are either dominating that particular niche, or have sold your idea for squillions of dollars to a forward-thinking investor.5. A long-term visionAt the heart of building a new product category is the ability to align yourself with shared visions of the future.Concretely, this translates to products that are sustainable, eco-friendly, and globally accessible.Thinking about the long-term future isn’t just about planning ahead; it’s about valuing the role and responsibilities of your technology within the broader advancements of economy and culture.Baremetrics helps founders hit their financial targets with the sharpest business insights on the market.

      "How To Verify That Your Website Is User-Friendly.\n",
      "Websites have been around for so long now that it seems we’ve started taking them for granted. However, they are still a starting point for a lot of customers online. From giving the business more authority to creating sales funnels, you can miss out on many opportunities to connect with your audience if they’re walking away with a bad user experience after visiting your website.Keep in mind that it’s not enough to simply add new content – you need to keep tracking all the factors that impact the optimization and its ranking.There are a lot of improvements you can make to make sure that your landing pages are user friendly, starting with design and going all the way to backend adjustments. Let’s talk about some steps that’ll give your visitors a great experience, improving the SERP ranking in the process.All technical buzzwords aside, the visual aspect is one of the key factors which impact visitors’ impression of your website.. This doesn’t refer just to images and good color choices (although they’re important as well). The ways you set up all elements of a page have an impact on UX which is why you should always approach the edits from a user’s perspective.One of the best ways to determine if your website’s visual presentation is up to standard is through user testing. This helps you get to know ins and outs of everything that could be an issue for the average visitor. Implementing usability testing tools such as PlaybookUX could save your time in the long run. You can use it to watch real people interact with your website, see which materials resonate with your visitors and understand their needs before you add new pages. This makes the testing process easily scalable.One of the key aspects of making everything more user friendly is content readability. Aside from a clear, readable font (never choose style over functionality when it comes to fonts), you should also think about how users will interact with it. Many visitors just gloss over text and that means you need to do everything you can to make the message as accessible as possible.For example when you include a clickable table of contents, it makes it much easier to read through.Some ways to make content more readable include:Appropriate headings and subheadings – Use a single H1 for the subject of a page, while thinking about H2 as chapters for the content below. If you need to go into more detail, use H3 for sub-sections.Number or bullet listsParagraphs that aren’t too long. Ideally, they shouldn’t have more than 2-3 sentences.A mix of text and imagesBold and italic fonts. Rather than using all caps or different sizes of text, use these to make information stand out.You can also add contrasts and highlights in appropriate spots to improve the readability. This is especially important when it comes to links – users should always be able to make a difference between them and other text, so they need to look clickable.Aside from being easily recognizable, links should streamline the user's path through the website. They should also offer relevant pages to go to next and suggest content that’s related to what they’ve read.Additionally, make sure to include CTAs – they should come at appropriate moments in the visitors flow and make it logical to make a certain action.Navigating through the website should feel fluid.  you need to organize your content in a way that’s logical and provides user-friendly ways to engage with it.To do this, Think about your website’s search feature and ways to improve it. Here are some steps that’ll make it easier for your audience to improve the users’ experience:Allow alternate spellings and typos so it’s easier for the users to reach the things they’re interested inOffer suggestions for similar content and highlight keywords that can lead the visitors to a related pageShow the most recent additions on top so the users can save time on sorting contentCategories such as the About page, Contact information, as well as details about other business specifics should be clearly visible. You’ll achieve this by creating a clear structure, with navigation and different tabs properly labeled so the users don’t have to do any guesswork.The Airbnb homepage is a good example of this, as you can see the most important category fields for your search right away.Some additional ways that can help you organize content:Place the most important information firstAvoid using industry jargon and confusing abbreviationsUse tags for your content so that users can search more efficientlyDon’t place too many elements in the navigationRemove dead-ends, such as pages without linksWhen you’ve taken care of the content and presentation needs of your website, you need to dive into the technical side of things. Verify that you’ve done everything to make your website as user friendly as possible for all of your users, regardless of how they’re accessing it.Mobile devices excluding tablets generate more than 50% of all website traffic, so a responsive and scalable experience that’s mobile-friendly should be a standard. Each user should have a near-identical interaction no matter what they’re using for their visit.All of the elements, from navigation to text and images should be automatically formatted, resized and spaced.When we’re talking about your website being responsive, it doesn’t just include devices. You should also make sure that each browser and operating system is equally supported so that you cover a broad  audience.To make the experience even more user-friendly, you should reduce loading time as much as possible. Not only are the users  more likely to leave your website if the pages are taking too long to load, but better times also improve your search engine ranking.If you’re unsure of how to make your loading times faster, you should avoid excessive videos, optimize images and fonts, remove non-essential widgets, as well as third party plug-ins.When it comes to wide-spread access, you shouldn’t just stop at the means of visiting your website. Users themselves shouldn’t have any obstacles in getting to your content.Have in mind that people with disabilities may also visit your website. Implement web design techniques that’ll ensure a seamless experience for everyone. For example, add audio navigation to make the pages accessible for visually-impaired visitors.For example, The Disability Trust has various accessibility options clearly displayed on their homepage rith at the top of the page. Users should also always know what’s going on in terms of their actions. For example, each error should be clearly labeled, with a direction provided for further actions. It should always be clear to users what they need to do to get the desired outcome. Another example for this would be adding a direct call widget in the contact section.If you’re using forms, for example to get feedback, avoid asking for too much data and try showing a progress bar so they’ll know the status at any point of the process.Finally, you need to consider the ways to solve any backed issues that may come up. It’s important to run extensive tests to catch any possible bugs that may impair your website’s functionality. Another thing that impacts user experience are broken links, so you need to do a clean-up that will leave you with content that doesn’t stop the users’ flow.Aside from functionality, you also need to perform regular security checks to make sure everything’s up to current standards. Google prefers websites that are secured with a SSL certificate. This distinction indicates a couple important factors that both raise your search engine ranking and give users additional assurance that they can trust you:Website data, including passwords and e-mail addresses are protected from hackersYour page’s identity is identified through a third party so nobody can use your website’s name for malicious and deceptive pages.One of the best ways to make sure you have the green light is by running the URL through Google Safe Browsing tool.If you don’t set it up properly, users are going to be warned that they shouldn’t visit your website, so you could miss out on a lot of traffic.The easiest way to check if your website is secure is to look for a padlock symbol next to the URL address, which indicates that the protection is available.You should also keep your plug-ins up to date to make your website even less vulnerable to outside risks.When you’re verifying that your website is user friendly, it’s important that you go over all the ways your users are going to interact with it and test if all flows as it should. This way you’ll avoid users’ frustration that can impact your website's ranking and the business as a whole in the long run.Start with a usability test and run through your content. Think about the ways users can perceive it, if the design is easily readable and that everything is sorted in a simple, efficient way.Your Next step should be optimization and making sure that as many users as possible can access your content without obstacles, including devices, systems or their personal obstacles.Finally, dive into the technical side of things and keep security as tight as possible to further improve your ranking and prove to your users that they can trust you.\n"

      "AARRR Metrics Framework: What Is It and How To Use It.\n",
      "AARRR is an abbreviation that stands for “acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue”. AARRR, often called the pirate metrics framework (as in “arr, matey”), helps Shopify Partners perfect their funnel by providing actionable metrics for each stage of the sales and marketing strategy.In this article, we’ll go through each part of the AARRR metrics framework, why it’s useful for growing Shopify apps, and how to improve outcomes in each part of the framework. The AARRR framework was developed by Dave McClure, a Silicon Valley investor and the founder of 500 Startups. With so many vanity metrics floating around out there, the AARRR metrics provide an easy-to-remember system for tracking what matters. Let’s look at each component of AARRR metrics in more detail.This is the first step in the framework. Acquisition starts with people finding you and ends with them being paid customers. How people find you depends on your marketing strategy. For example, an inbound marketing strategy finds customers by producing lots of high-quality content and waiting for Google to help prospective clients find you.Alternatively, you might be relying on banner ads, Facebook ads, or Google AdSense. Activation quickly follows and overlaps with acquisition. Here is where your leads become opportunities.While acquisition is all about getting visitors—the right visitors, specifically—to your website, activation is how you push those interested prospects to engage with your product. This is a two-step process. First, your leads take positive action towards trying your product. For example, if you have a free trial, they give that a go. Second, you convert your qualified leads or free trials into paying customers.The rate by which you convert customers is your conversion rate. One way you can increase your conversion rate is by monitoring your trial data: which customers are trialing, how long your trials typically last, and which plans they sign up for. Baremetrics makes monitoring trial data easy by calculating your trial data in real-time: Customer retention is the most important thing you can work on as a business owner. Why? On average, acquiring a new customer can cost five times more than keeping an existing customer. That’s why you need to identify your customers at risk of churn right away and focus on providing an exceptional customer experience. There’s a few ways to do this:Let’s explore that question in the Baremetrics app. We can see that the Pro plan (pink line) and Startup plan (yellow line) have a consistently similar user churn rate that fluctuates between 2 and 7 percent. The Enterprise plan, however, has been consistently higher than the other two plans and steadily increasing since October 2021. Our Enterprise customers are likely experiencing similar issues that lead to their higher churn as a segment. If you want to see more real-life examples of customer segmentation and how it can improve your customer retention strategy, check out our how-to guide. As we talked about earlier, previous stages of the framework involved converting leads into paying customers. The Referral stage, then, is when you turn your existing customers into brand advocates. From five-star ratings in the Shopify App Store to customer referrals, word-of-mouth marketing is a proven way to drive long-term success.In particular, customer referrals are one of the most important groups of metrics to focus on. After all, having your customers refer others to your product is every business’s dream. It’s a genuine and low-cost way to acquire new customers.To gauge the likelihood of your existing customers referring your product to other people, you can use the Net Promoter Score. Once customers sign up as paid customers, your revenue stream begins. Revenue is what differentiates a hobby from a business. It is the proof that your app has value and users are willing to pay for it. There are many metrics to track for revenue. Some of the most popular include: Metrics are meant to answer simple questions about your company. Here are some examples of questions founders might ask in each stage of the AARRR framework: It can be difficult to calculate all the different business metrics needed to grow Shopify apps. That’s why Shopify Partners use Baremetrics. With a zero-setup integration, Baremetrics pulls your Shopify data and turns it into useful dashboards, like this. \n",
      "This Small-Business Retirement Plan Can Really Build Wealth (Or, How to Become a 401(k) Millionaire).\n",
      "This plan isn’t for everyone.If your business struggles to turn a profit, this won’t help. But once you make much more than you need to cover expenses, it’s time!Different than most, I was actually happy when my taxes were first on track to exceed the median US salary.Truly.No, I’m not a glutton for (financial) punishment. It’s just that having to pay high taxes meant my business was very profitable. However, that didn’t mean I wanted to pay more in taxes than I had to. A couple of quotes from Judge Learned Hand support my view:“Any one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes.” – Gregory v. Helvering, 69 F.2d 809, 810 (2d Cir. 1934)“Over and over again courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everybody does so, rich or poor; and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands: taxes are enforced exactions, not voluntary contributions. To demand more in the name of morals is mere cant.” – Commissioner v. Newman, 159 F.2d 848, 851 (2d Cir. 1947) - dissenting opinionThis doesn’t mean we shouldn’t consider the good of others, for example, by making charitable donations. It’s just that once I meet the tax code’s requirements, I’d rather target my money to causes I care about, rather than leave it to government officials, elected or appointed, to spend my money as they please.As a small-business owner you have options.The three most popular ones are the SIMPLE IRA, the SEP IRA, and the One-Participant or Individual 401(k).For my money, the last is the winner, and the one I opened for both my main business (and my wife’s, once her practice qualified).Assume your profits (plus your spouse’s income, if any) are high enough to cover your family expenses and leave plenty over.Your marginal federal income tax could be as high as 37%. If you live in a high-tax state like California, you might have to pay up to 12.3% to the state, and the 2017 tax law limits your ability to deduct state taxes plus property taxes to a measly $10,000.That means you’d get double-taxed and your total income tax burden could near 50%!Enter the Individual 401(k).If your tax bracket is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement, a traditional 401(k) lets you defer taxes on a total (employee salary deferral plus employer elective contribution) of up to $61,000 for 2022, plus an extra $6,500 if you’re over 50 years old!If you think your retirement tax bracket will be higher, there’s a Roth option with the same limits.Say you started contributing to a 401(k) when you turned 50, at the start of 2006, maxing out your contributions each year (from $49k in 2006 to $63.5k in 2020, including catch-up amounts, in equal monthly amounts), here’s how your balance would have developed over the following 15 years.If you were aggressive and invested 100% in the S&P 500, you’d have ended 2020 with nearly $2 million! Had you been a bit more conservative, investing 70% in the S&P 500 and 30% in bonds, and rebalanced annually, you’d have finished 2020 with just under $1.7 million, still far from shabby, and your portfolio balance would not have been as volatile.Better yet, if your spouse worked for your business, with a high enough salary to let you max out his or her contributions too, you’d have ended 2020 with over $3.9 million with the all-stocks portfolio, or just under $3.4 million with the 70/30 portfolio.With $3.4 million, using the 4% rule, you’d be able to withdraw $136,000 in the first year of your retirement, adjusting each year for inflation, and having an excellent chance of maintaining that for the rest of your lives.Obviously, if you start today, your results over the coming 15 years will be different, but the above illustrates the power of combining the high annual contributions with tax-deferred investing of a traditional 401(k).Doing the same with a Roth 401(k), your contributions would have been in after-tax dollars, which is harder. However, while your balances would have been the same, all Roth distributions in retirement would be tax-free!In my case, I started my Individual 401(k) in 2012, and while I’ve maxed out what I could given the salary I pay myself, that’s less than what I could have set aside with a higher salary (remember that the employer contribution is limited to 25% of your compensation).With 10 years of somewhat less than the absolute maximum allowed, and only my contributions, my results are less than the above hypothetical, but still pretty great.You know what really blew my mind?In a good year for the markets, your 401(k) returns might outpace your business profits!Not convinced?Say your annual profits (before accounting for the salary you pay yourself and your 401(k) contribution) are a healthy $300,000. If your 401(k) returns 35% for the year on a $1 million balance, your investment returns just blew past your business profits, even ignoring returns on current-year contributions.I doubt this will happen very often, especially in the early years, when your plan balance is pre-7-figures, but when it does it’ll probably blow your mind like it did mine!If you’re still not sure the Individual 401(k) is best for you, here’s a handy comparison table for the three most popular small-business retirement plans.SIMPLE IRASEP IRAIndividual 401(k)Eligibility for opening plan for your businessAny business owner, generally with 100 or fewer employeesAny business owner, with or without employeesAny business owner with no employees*, other than spouseContribution limitTotal of up to $19,200 in 2021 and $23,150 in 2022, with an additional $3,000 catch-up contribution if 50 or olderUp to $58,000 in 2021 and $61,000 in 2022 (no elective deferrals or catch-up contributions allowed)Total of up to $58,000 in 2021 and $61,000 in 2022, with an additional $6,500 catch-up contribution if 50 or olderTaxes on contributionsContributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the yearContributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the yearTraditional 401(k): Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the year. Roth 401(k): Contributions are made with after-tax dollarsTaxes on qualified distributions in retirementQualified distributions are taxed as incomeQualified distributions are taxed as incomeTraditional 401(k): Qualified distributions are taxed as income. Roth 401(k): Qualified distributions are tax-free* Previously, part-time employees working less than 1000 hours/year would not affect your ability to open an Individual 401(k), but the SECURE Act changed that. Now, if you have one or more employees who worked between 500 and 999 hours/year for three years, they’re considered long-term part-time employees, who must be given access to your 401(k) plan. This means your business no longer qualifies for an Individual 401(k) (though if willing to take on the greater expenses and complications of a regular 401(k) plan, that’s still available to you).Clearly, the SIMPLE IRA limits are much lower than the SEP IRA’s, which are similar to the 401(k)’s if you’re under 50. If you’re over 50, the Individual 401(k) allows $6,500 higher contribution than the SEP IRA, due to the catch-up provision. Even if you’re under 50, in certain situations the 401(k) is better, as its limit is 100% of salary as deferral plus 25% of compensation as elective employer contribution, vs. 20% of business revenue for the SEP IRA of a sole proprietorship or sole-member LLC (that isn’t set up to be taxes as an S-corp).In addition, the 401(k) allows a Roth option, and may allow loans, neither of which is allowed for SEP IRAs. As a minor downside, Individual 401(k) plans with total balances over $250,000 require you to file a (relatively simple) form 5500.By the way, some advisory companies allow you to open a so-called Solo 401(k), where you can invest in assets beyond stocks, annuities, ETFs, and mutual funds. These include e.g. residential or commercial real estate, raw land, mortgages, private loans, tax liens, private businesses, gold, currencies, etc.First, talk with your tax advisor to make sure your business is set up right and is profitable enough to make a 401(k) advisable. Assuming your advisor agrees, find a solid provider and follow their process. I use T. Rowe Price, but there are many others out there.If your solo business is raking in high profits, and you want to build wealth for retirement, you’d likely do well to open an Individual 401(k) plan as soon as possible and contribute as much as you can for as long as you can. Do that for a decade or more and you may easily become a 401(k) (multi-)millionaire!This article is intended for informational purposes only, and should not be considered financial, investment, business, or legal advice; nor is it an endorsement of any particular retirement-plan provider.

      "5 Tools Marketers Can Use to Improve Their Workflow.\n",
      "Marketing is key to business success.Think about it. If people don't know about your brand, they'll never buy anything from you and you'll go out of business faster than you can say \"fire sale!\"Yes, marketing is necessary, but it's not easy. There's always a new strategy to try, more content to create, another social channel to engage customers on. The only way to keep up is to improve your workflow so that you can get more done in less time.The five tools below will supercharge your workflow and turn you into a productivity machine. All you have to do is evaluate each option and choose the ones that fit your needs.Let's take a look!First up, we have CloudApp, a visual communication platform that's been proven to boost productivity levels by as much as 300%—not bad! It does so by combining three tools:A Screen and Webcam Recorder: With CloudApp, you can easily record your screen, your face (via your computer's webcam), or both simultaneously.A Powerful GIF Creator: GIFs are those short, soundless videos you see on social media All. The. Time. Create customized GIFs with CloudApp.An Image Annotation Solution: Use CloudApp to take a screenshot of your computer screen. Then add text, arrows, emojis, and more to it in seconds.\"Cool,\" you're thinking. \"But how do screen and webcam recording, GIF creation, and image annotation features improve my marketing workflow?\" Fair question…Think back to the last time you sent an important email to a colleague. How long did it take you? If you're like most people, the answer is too long. It takes time to craft written messages that include all necessary information and are easy to understand.Now, imagine how much time you'd save if you could simply click a button on your computer and record yourself talking to the camera. You wouldn't have to agonize over the right words. You'd simply speak your mind like you do when you talk to people face-to-face.CloudApp excels as an internal communication tool. But it can also be used to create top-level marketing content. Record your screen to make software product demos. Capture screenshots and add them to your landing pages. Create GIFs for social media.With CloudApp, every aspect of your workflow, from communicating with teammates to creating content for your audience, becomes easier. Start with a free account, and then upgrade for unlimited recording and custom branding for $9.95/month.Trello is a popular project management tool that's used by the likes of Google, Ebay, and Costco to organize projects and boost collaboration between team members.The app is built on the Kanban methodology. Users create Trello boards, then populate them with cards, which can be organized into different lists, AKA columns. Cards, which represent tasks, can be assigned to specific team members and include due dates, attachments, and conversations. As projects progress, cards can be moved from list to list in real time.Let's pretend you were just hired to run Awesome Company's blog—congratulations!The first thing you do is create a Trello board and name it \"Awesome Company Blog\". You then add four lists to your board: the first you call \"Ideas,\" the second you call \"Writing,\" the third you call \"Editing\", and the fourth you call \"Published.\"Next, you create a different card for every blog topic you can think of and add them to your \"Ideas\" list. Each card contains target keywords, a potential due date, etc.When you're ready to start working on a blog post, you move it's corresponding Trello card from the \"Ideas\" list to the \"Writing\" list. You then repeat this action throughout the blog creation process until the piece has been published and its card is in the \"Published\" list.Trello also includes built-in automations to streamline work, and integrations with thousands of other tools like Google Drive, Slack, and Dropbox.All said, Trello is a super intuitive tool, which is why marketers of all stripes use it to improve their workflows. You can use it, too, for $0 - $17.50 a month, per user.Your company's on social media, right? Then you know how time-consuming it is to create and post content, respond to comments, analyze metrics… If you're not careful, the Facebooks, Instagrams, and Twitters of the world will completely wreck your workflow.To make sure social media doesn't suck up your day like a blood-hungry vampire, get Buffer.Buffer is an intuitive and affordable social media management tool that allows users to schedule their social content ahead of time. You simply log in, tell Buffer what you want to post, where you want to post it, and when you want the post to go live.Buffer will then publish your content at the appointed time, notify you of comments so that you can respond to them, and track each post's performance for you.Imagine this scenario:It's Monday, January 3rd and you're ready to dominate 2022. But most of your clients are still on vacation and you don't have any projects to work on. What do you do? You log in to Buffer and schedule your brand's social media content for the entire month!Once done, you won't have to worry about social media at all, aside from responding to the comments you receive, until February 1st. You can spend all of your time on bigger, more important business initiatives. Talk about improving your workflow…You can start using Buffer for free, and if you like using the tool and want access to premium features for analytics and engagement, upgrade to the \"Essentials\" plan for $5 a month, per channel.Did you know that 80% of people remember what they see, but only 20% of what they read? Or that Facebook posts with images get 2.3x more engagement than text-based posts? Maybe this is why publishers who post visual content grow 12x faster than those who don't.The problem is, most of us are design-challenged, AKA we couldn't create a visually pleasing image to save our lives. Raise your hand if you're in this group? Don't worry! Canva is here to help you craft stunning visuals in no time flat.With Canva, the most design-challenged of us all can create eye-catching social media images, infographics, promotional flyers, logos, and videos. Here's how:Create a free Canva account and log into it.Choose from one of Canva's professionally-designed templates.Customize it with text, shapes, photos, and backgrounds from the Canva library.Edit your image until it's perfect. Then download it and use it as you see fit.And that's it! Working with Canva is so easy a monkey could do it, which is the whole point. But all of this functionality won't cost you an arm and a leg. Expect to spend somewhere between $0 and $10 a month, depending on which features you need access to.For design-challenged, budget-focused professionals who want to improve their marketing workflows without harming their bottom lines, Canva is a godsend.Every marketing team is different. As such, we all use different strategies to promote our companies and products/services. That said, there's one thing just about every marketer has in common: the written word. You can't really market a business without it.It doesn't matter if you're crafting an email sequence, creating social media content, working on a blog, or putting together a PPC campaign, you have to use words.Grammarly is an online writing assistant that helps users craft \"bold, clear, mistake-free\" content via cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

      "4 Powerful Tools for Customer Experience Research.\n",
      "What do website optimization, product design and content strategy have in common? They should all start with thorough research that ends in valuable insights from your customers.Even developers must do thorough research during the website planning process so they can create a user-friendly platform.There are a lot of things that you can achieve going in blind, but a good customer experience can help you with those results that matter – getting new users and retaining existing ones. With proper research you can start getting to know your audience in-depth. Do you know what pain points your users have? How about the ways they engage with your platform? When you get the answers to these kinds of questions, you’ll be able to come up with simple fixes that you didn’t think about before and make efficient changes.Still, trying to get those elusive insights is far from simple. But as with all other things that are important, the results will be worth your effort.  Not sure where to start? Let’s take a look at some of the tools that can help you understand your audience through proper research and consider new perspectives on getting the most out of your users.Figuring out your customer’s journey isn’t a simple task, but this comprehensive customer experience platform brings together features that aim to help you understand it.FullSession is one of the best Hotjar alternatives currently available for free. It includes three main tools that you can use in your process to gather relevant user data and analyze insights.Session Recording – Using instant replays, you can see complete user visits. Aside from the recordings that can show you issues and pain points that they encounter, you can also filter your users and sort them into groups. These can be based on a variety of factors, from their operating system and the performance they had, to all of the engagements that they made.Further segmenting through characteristics such as average session time can be useful in learning why the conversions aren’t happening.Interactive Heatmap – Real-time tracking is available for all elements, both static and dynamic. Filtering users is also available for heatmaps, which can be used for determining where they drop off off your website the most and how.Customer Feedback – You can also get real-time input from users about each page. There are options for instant visual feedback, as well as NPS based on custom user segments. By pairing them with session recordings, you can view replays for specific users that gave a low score and get insights of what went wrong with their session.Basic packages with 3.000 monthly sessions start at $39, while there is also a Business package with 15.000 sessions per month and the price of $99. You can also ask for a tailor-made solution if you want to customize some of the features in a package. By bringing together product analytics and data science, this tool offers built-in reporting with actionable insights that matter the most.If you’re not sure whether or not the user journey that you came up with will work, you can use a set of reports to get the answers that you need (and hit your goals along the way).Acquisition reports – This tool aims at optimizing user acquisition by analyzing elements such as traffic sources and their impact on the results, landing page efficiency and the sign-up process conversion rate.User onboarding reports – These are a good way to analyze the user activation process for your product. Insights covered include the number of new accounts and the onboarding process, time needed for getting new users started, actions that they take between steps, as well as influences on the completion rate.Retention reports – With this feature, you can also track how well you retain newly onboarded users, the retention rate on those who didn’t finish the process and differences between returning accounts and the churned ones.Revenue reports – This is a functionality that’s still in the making. It’s focused on bringing together the company’s revenue and user engagement metrics to help you answer questions regarding the value of customers and the impact of churn on revenue.InnerTrends has a free version and free-trial periods, while other, more comprehensive packages start at $79 per month and change based on features available and a simultaneous number of accounts.This tool is all about qualitative analysis – it helps you explore the reasons of users’ behavior and deep-dives into all-important insights.Smartlook relies on a set of features aimed at always-on support and automated tracking. It gets you actionable information about your users both on websites and native mobile apps.Recordings – Similar to FullSession, Smartlook offers instant replays that can be used to explore how visitors act during their sessions, determine their profile and filter them based on more than 30 recordings to get the most relevant insights.Heatmaps – You can implement this element of customer experience research retroactively using data that you already have. These are easily segmented and shared using direct links.Events – The best way to apply these is to save time by skipping interactions that aren’t important and looking up specific moments during a session, such as clicking the add to cart button. Everything is tracked automatically, so you can choose a specific event to track and see all the related data.Funnels – This can be easily tied into events to track the issues users run into and fix them to increase conversion rates. As soon as you create a funnel, you can assess the data and see how it’s performing.Analytics and Reporting – You can track data from all features through a customizable dashboard, along with automated tracking for everything and alerts for timely reactions. One-click retention tables can also help you identify specific engagements and identify churn.Pricing starts at €31 per month. There are also plans that offer more features and are priced depending on the size of your business.This software specializes in customer success and product experience. It combines customer feedback features and user-related analytics to help you improve customer experience.Gainsight covers additional areas, such as customer expansion, but when it comes to gathering actionable insights there are three functionalities that stand out.CX Center – This feature gives you a detailed, centralized view of customer insights. One of the specifics that make it stand out is Natural Language Processing – functionality that helps you identify your users’ most important issues. This gives you an insight of the relation between your actions and retention and revenue growth. It also has sentiment-based alerts for solving problems at the source.Surveys – The software has options for numerous custom surveys for customer research, including Customer Effort Score, NPS and CSAT. You can apply pre-made questions and materials from their best practice library and analyze responses to optimize your strategy based on the results.Journey Orchestrator – You can apply automated customer journeys to scale more efficiently. These are triggered by the most important events in the life cycle, which means that users get the right survey at the appropriate time. You can also use this to automate major moments for the customers such as onboardings and renewals.Gainsight’s pricing for the package that includes all of the CX features, are only available upon request.The overview of these convenient tools should give you a glimpse of what proper customer experience research can show you.Depending on what goals you’re trying to achieve, you should try out the specific features that different platforms offer. Differences can often be in the details, so you should always explore before commiting.There are many more options on the market for you to experiment with, but this selection of powerful tools is the perfect starting point. There’s no way around it – you need to see these tools in action to determine if they’re a perfect match for your business, but with clear goals and consistent use you’ll get those KPIs crossed off your list in no time. \n"

      "Shopify Revenue Share: What Shopify Partners Need to Know (2021).\n",
      "Shopify has made it more profitable than ever to sell apps in the Shopify App Store.We’ve already discussed many of the huge updates they’ve announced for Shopify app developers. These include Shopify Hydrogen and Oxygen, changes to the Shopify Checkout, and an updated Shopify Partners dashboard.But none of these updates compare to the one we are talking about today. At the Shopify Unite 2021 event, Shopify announced a drastic reduction of their revenue share.Since August 1st, 2021, Shopify has eliminated its revenue share on the first 1,000,000 USD of revenue earned by Shopify Partners. But that’s not all—after a company reaches their first million, Shopify has also changed its revenue share on additional revenue generated calendar year is also dropping from 20% to 15%!In this article, we’ll go over the new revenue share, how to register for the revenue share, example scenarios, FAQs about the recent changes, and more. Just how much less money will you be paying with the new revenue share? Well, that depends on how much money you are currently earning. Before we give you some examples, we’re going to explain exactly what Shopify means by zero percent revenue share and how they calculate the $1,000,000 threshold. First, the thresholds and revenue share are calculated annually. That means that you can earn $1,000,000 every year without paying any Shopify revenue share whatsoever!Second, the revenue share is calculated per App Developer, which includes any Associated Developer Accounts. That means that you do not get to claim each app or each developer separately. Shopify Partners do not automatically qualify for the new zero percent revenue share. You must register to take advantage of this great offer! But don’t worry, the process is simple and we are going to go over it here.Furthermore, if you are an existing Shopify Partner, then the entire process is free. If you are new to developing apps for Shopify, then there is a Shopify Partner registration fee of $99 per account.Here is a summary of the basic details of registering for the new revenue share program:Let’s go through five basic scenarios to see how the Shopify revenue share has changed:In this case, under the previous system you would have paid 20% of your revenue, which means $100,000 in Year 1 and then $160,000 in Year 2. Under the new Shopify revenue share plan, the amount that you pay drops to 0% for the first year, and because the threshold resets yearly you still pay $0 in Year 2! That represents a savings of the $260,000 you would have paid previously:Revenue Share (USD)Old SystemNew SystemDifferenceYear 1Year 2TotalYear 1Year 2Total100,000160,000260,000000260,000Under the previous system, you would have paid 20% during both years, which would be $240,000 in Year 1 and then $160,000 in Year 2.With the new system, your revenue share becomes 0% of the first $1,000,000 and then 15% of the next $200,000 in Year 1, which is $30,000. After the threshold resets, in Year 2 you would pay nothing. This represents a decrease in the Shopify revenue share of $370,000:Revenue Share (USD)Old SystemNew SystemDifferenceYear 1Year 2TotalYear 1Year 2Total240,000160,000400,00030,000030,000370,000At 20% under the previous system, your revenue share would be $100,000 in the first year and then $300,000 in the second year.This changes to $0 in the first year, followed by 0% of $1,000,000 and 15% of $500,000, or $75,000, under the new zero percent revenue share.That’s a reduction of $325,000:Revenue Share (USD)Old SystemNew SystemDifferenceYear 1Year 2TotalYear 1Year 2Total100,000300,000400,000075,00075,000325,000Using the previous revenue share format, you would be paying $240,000 and $300,000 in the first and second years.This changes to $30,000 and $75,000 in Years 1 and 2 once you register for the new profit share plan.

That’s $200,000 and then $500,000 in the two years. Since the revenue share is calculated per developer and not per app, you need to add the amounts together. That means you are paying revenue on $1,000,000 in the first year, which is $0, and then on $2,500,000 in the second year, which is $225,000 (0% of the first $1,000,000 and then 15% of the remaining $1,500,000).In this scenario, you would be saving $435,000:Revenue Share (USD)Old SystemNew SystemDifferenceYear 1Year 2TotalYear 1Year 2Total200,000500,000700,0000225,000225,000475,000We’ve summarized the scenarios in the table below to make it easier to see just how much money you’ll be saving under the new system.ScenarioRevenue Share (USD)Old SystemNew SystemDifferenceYear 1Year 2TotalYear 1Year 2TotalScenario 1100,000160,000260,000000260,000Scenario 2240,000160,000400,00030,000030,000370,000Scenario 3100,000300,000400,000075,00075,000325,000Scenario 4240,000300,000540,00030,00075,000105,000435,000Scenario 5200,000500,000700,0000225,000225,000475,000Shopify’s new zero percent revenue share on your first million every year means more earnings in your pocket. More earnings means more growth, which you can track in Baremetrics. The registration process for the new Shopify revenue share plan is very simple. For current Shopify Partners, it is a five-step process. New Shopify Partners will have an extra step because they have to pay  the registration fee.

      "Scenario Planning and Financial Forecasting: A Starter’s Guide.\n",
      "Part of being an agile company is anticipating market forces before they happen and having a plan in place to dodge potential pitfalls while taking advantage of new opportunities. To do this, you need to use financial forecasting and scenario planning. Financial forecasting provides insights into how your company’s revenue and expenses are changing over time and will change into the future.Scenario planning involves mapping out different possible futures over the short and long term, as well as how you will react to them. Together, they give you the information you need to excel at strategic management. Financial forecasting is all about taking the current trends of your company and projecting them into the future. This provides you the best guess as to how your company will do over the following one or several years.Sound financial forecasts can predict how your revenue will change over time, and what those changes mean for your expenses. For example, if you project that your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) will increase by 10x in the new year, what would that mean for your labor needs? Do you have a hiring plan in place to accomplish that?Financial forecasting generally starts with forecasting how your sales will change month to month over the following year. This is usually supported by defining your marketing plan and how that will translate to visitors and leads.Then, you need to consider how your labor and other expenses will change with increased sales and a larger user base. A great budget template can help with this.The essence of scenario planning is building assumptions about how your business and market niche are going to change in the future. Since the future is uncertain, you want to create several sets of assumptions and plan accordingly.Once you have identified different sets of assumptions, you then consider what you can do when those different scenarios occur. It isn’t enough to just see the different scenarios that might occur. You need to have plans in place to react to those different scenarios and steer them towards your ideal one.Scenario planning is an incredibly powerful tool used by governments, militaries, and businesses alike to prepare for contingencies. You can bet your competition is using scenario planning and so should you!Now that you understand why scenario planning is important, I am going to run down an eight-step process to perform scenario planning in your SaaS enterprise.A full, detailed scenario planning session can last several months and entail the consumption of significant financial resources. While that is a worthwhile venture for larger companies or the government, it might be beyond the resources of a bootstrapped startup. However, you can still get great value from having your management spend a couple days working on a decent scenario planning exercise and then reviewing it every quarter. Below are steps that companies of all sizes can take to start scenario planning. You can’t model everything. Not only would it take over a year to model every contingency during a year, most of those possibilities are inconsequential anyways. It is also true that you only have so much bandwidth to plan and react to changes. If you do not have the resources to react to a change, then it shouldn’t be a focal point. Consider working from a single “what would happen if” question:What would happen if a new competitor entered the market?What would happen if our growth stalled?What would happen if Google changed its algorithm?What would happen if a celebrity tweeted out our company and the user base grew astronomically in a couple days?This is the “no bad answer” brainstorming part. Take your “what would happen if” and map out every factor that would affect that scenario.These can be the factors that would make it more likely to occur, make it worse or better for you, or what would happen as a result. Then, cut down the list to the major factors that would affect the conditions of the scenario and your ability to deal with it. Your company doesn’t operate in a vacuum. There are other businesses in the market niche. There are you customers and prospects. There are all the tools you need to use. There are also governments involved. While you might not think your tiny company is vulnerable to the whims of governments, that’s not the case. For example, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe drastically changed how websites and apps can store and use data. Do you have plans in place in case a similar law were enacted in America?Steps 2 and 3 call for listing everything. In those steps, it is better to get a chuckle for a silly factor than miss one of importance.Here you need to be a bit more selective. For example, with inflation rising, it is only a matter of time before central banks start raising interest rates. In that case, “what will we be paying on our business loan” is a critical unknown, while “is the banking sector going to collapse” is not as useful.Consider having your team vote on the issues raised based on two factors: their importance and how hard it is to predict them.You want to know all the important factors that you cannot predict easily.Now that you have a good idea of the critical uncertainties to your business, it is time to set up a logical set of scenarios.While a company with an infinite budget with a huge workforce might be willing to map out hundreds of scenarios, you are going to want to focus on between two and five.The US military has the resources to contemplate an alien invasion, but you don’t. So now you are going to consider the truly important factors to your business and the realistic values of uncertainty. Let’s say you think the likely range of your MRR growth is between 50% and 200% in the next year. You also think that your payroll expenses will increase between 5% and 20% over the next year. Then, you can build a 2x2 matrix with MRR growth on one axis and payroll expenses on the other:Now you want to build a narrative of how you get to these scenarios and what that means for your company. If your payroll expense growth outpaces MRR growth, is that because you over-hired or because you were previously underpaying for key roles?If your MRR growth exceeds your payroll expense increase, is that because you have found efficiencies or because you are now providing poor customer service and there is a disaster waiting to happen?This stage is all about storytelling. You want to build a realistic and detailed story about how you could get to each scenario.After Step 6, take a break. It requires a couple weeks or months for the team to regain their objectivity about the scenarios. For example, do the first half of scenario planning in the summer and then incorporate the second half into your year-end planning meetings.When you come back with fresh eyes, it is time to understand the implications and options. Implications are what it means for your company if Scenario 2 vs. Scenario 1 occurs. Options are what you can do in Scenario 1 vs. Scenario 3. You should also come up with options for how you can move from Scenario 3 to Scenario 4. How would you know in January or April that your end-of-year Scenario 2 is happening instead of Scenario 4?Early indicators are signals in your metrics that things are progressing towards a specific scenario. If March and April tend to be where you get 60% of the new users per year, then by the middle of March you should be reacting to the MRR growth you are seeing to push towards the rosier scenarios. By the end of April, you should have a good idea of whether MRR is growing by closer to 50% or 200% this year. Similarly, if your recruiters are finding it hard to get new quality team members at the salaries you are offering in June, then that might be an indication payroll expenses are heading towards a 20% increase.Scenario planning and financial forecasting are related strategic tools. They help you predict and therefore plan for the future.Once you appreciate the uncertainty of the years ahead, you can begin to build plans to work towards your ideal future.That’s why growing SaaS companies use FlightPath by Baremetrics.

      "How to make a hiring plan that stands up financially.\n",
      "As your user base increases month to month, you’ll naturally need more employees. Your customer success teams need to grow with your user base to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction.Your marketing and sales budgets, and the personnel assigned to those teams, will also rise.A hiring plan is the basis for growing your team and organizing your future payroll expenses. A hiring plan allocates expected future expenses based on your revenue forecasts.A sound hiring plan allocates these expenses in advance so that your team knows when they need to attract new talent, as well as their budget for onboarding them.The hiring plan is a list of all the expected roles you will hire for over the next year, along with the planned month of onboarding and the expected salary range. It can also include a column that describes the milestone that needs to be achieved to officially greenlight the hire.Hiring plans are a strategic tool in supporting a team within the budget constraints of your company. A strong hiring plan will consider the growth trajectory of your company, the prevailing salary expectations of your market, and the staffing requirements to meet your needs. With all this information at hand, you can predict who you need, when, and at what cost. That way, you are never surprised by sudden payroll increases or finding yourself short staffed.Simply put, hiring plans help your company employ people and operate successfully. They help prevent situations like staff shortages, which can quickly lead to burnout within your department and increase employee turnover.Other benefits of using a functioning hiring plan include: You can create your hiring plan by considering the following steps:A stakeholder is anyone who would be affected by hiring (or not hiring) new personnel. This includes three groups of people: department heads, the finance team, and individual employees.The individual employees will give you an idea of how much each employee can reasonably do in a day. If they seem bored at work, you can slow down hiring. If they are overworked, you might need to hire more in the short term to catch up.Individual employees are also going to give you an idea of who is interested in moving on and what higher up positions they are interested in. If your customer onboarding specialist wants to move into a sales manager position, then you should be aiming to hire a new customer onboarding specialist instead of a new sales manager.The department heads are going to tell you where they see gaps in their talent needs, as well as where they anticipate further needs based on their strategic planning.The finance team is going to tell you about the expected growth of the company and your overall hiring budget. They can also better define when new team members should be hired and at what salary.You should inventory your current workforce, including their abilities, future expectations, and any specific skills that may be lacking. One important part of this is looking at your historic turnover. Let’s say you currently have 20 employees and will need 24 at the end of the year. How many new employees do you need? How much will your payroll increase?The answers will depend on your employee turnover and the salary growth expectations of your employees. Employee turnover is the percentage of employees who will leave in any given year. If you have 20 employees and your turnover is 20%, then you will need to replace four current employees in addition to hiring four new employees.Let’s say you offer all employees a generous 5% raise every year. That doesn’t mean you can expect to only spend 5% more on your current employees. You may need to promote one of those employees to a new management position because of all the new hires. You might also have a developer who deserves to be recognized as a senior developer.Part of a strong hiring plan for the year ahead is to evaluate the hiring and recruitment plans of the previous year. The following are just some of the questions you should be asking:You should be taking the time to create an accurate budget to support your hiring plan. It can be expensive and time consuming to find quality hires, and the best channel may change year to year.You should consider the following when defining your hiring resources:The timeline for your hiring plan should be as specific as possible while still being flexible. If you expect to hire four customer service team members, is it better to bring a new person on every quarter or hire and train them all at once? Do you expect all four will remain on the team or should you hire five in expectation of one not lasting till the end of the year?This is where you take your financial forecasts and compare them to the number of employees on each team you need to achieve that growth and deal with it afterwards.For example, if you want to double your number of leads and user base, does that require twice the marketing resources or three times the team members? Afterwards, will your success team be able to handle twice the users with only 1.5 times the number of employees?To get automated profit and loss statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets, use FlightPath by Baremetrics.A hiring plan is typically a cross-departmental responsibility. First, the finance team projects the expected revenue and user growth for the year ahead.Then, the department heads in collaboration with their team members propose their needed hires based on that projection. They also stipulate when during the year the recruitment should take place as well as any milestones that need to be achieved to officially go forward with the hire.

      "Bookkeeping vs. accounting vs. controller vs. finance.\n",
      "Bookkeeping, accounting, and finance management are all critical to the financial success of your business. However, there are some key differences in these activities. Bookkeepers, accountants, controllers, and CFOs all have different roles. While sometimes the tasks associated with the roles can be outsourced, there will come a time when you need to have someone in-house performing the jobs. In this article, we will explore the following comparisons: bookkeeping vs. accounting, accounting vs. controller, controller vs. finance, finance vs. bookkeeping. If you imagine the financial management of your company as a pyramid, then the bookkeeping is at the bottom. Accurate and meticulous journals provide the solid foundation of a company’s financial health.Bookkeeping is simply the recording of financial transactions. It is the day-to-day counterpart of the big idea work done under accounting. Bookkeeping includes the creation of source documents, such as bills, invoices, and journal entries, so that there is a record of all financial transactions.A bookkeeper’s primary job is data entry. Bookkeepers are responsible for maintaining all of the financial records for the company. Bookkeepers are also generally responsible for invoicing customers, making sure bills are paid, ensuring there are no errors on any documents, and tracking revenue and expenses in general.While the job can appear to be just following simple instructions, a bookkeeper should have a general appreciation of the duties of finance managers and accountants so that they keep all data in a usable format.Built on the foundation of financial health provided by bookkeeping, accountancy takes the information provided by bookkeepers and puts it in an understandable format. This produces actionable documents that are easily understood by businesspeople and the wider public alike.Accounting is the measuring, processing, and presenting of financial information about businesses, government bodies, or other economic entities. Accounting comes in two forms: accrual accounting and cash accounting. Accounting has four many tasks:BudgetingCost allocation analysisPreparation of financial statementsForecastingWhile budgeting and the preparation of financial statements are tasks that overlap with bookkeeping, cost allocation analysis and forecasting are tasks often shared with finance management.Accountants perform tasks related to cost allocation following accounting principles and legislation. They are also in charge of drafting and managing budgets based on input from the finance managers.Accountants are involved in financial forecasting by visualizing revenue and expense data. However, the most important and most typical task of accountants is preparing financial statements. Every year, all public companies must present financial documents detailing the current state of the company and how it has progressed over the accounting period.These documents include the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.To get automated profit and loss, cash flow statements, and balance sheets, use FlightPath by Baremetrics.The controller takes the information provided by accountants, double checks it for accuracy, and then reports on the financial health. At the pinnacle of this pyramid, the CFO should understand all of the financial statements and the wider market environment of the company and be able to use that for forecasting and decision making.The controller is the manager of the accounting department. Controllers manage all of the accounting functions, from budget creation and adherence to the timely and accurate drafting of financial statements.This management includes preparing internal reports about whether budgets were followed and confirming that the financial statements are correct.Controllers also hand off these important documents to the appropriate stakeholders.In a small business, the controller might be the in-house accountant who coordinates with out-sourced bookkeepers and accountants who do the day-to-day and end-of-period accounting work, respectively. The chief financial officer (CFO) is the person in charge of finance management. In smaller companies, they might be the sole person in charge of finance management, while in larger companies they oversee, directly or indirectly, the bookkeepers, accountants, controllers, financial analysts, and finance managers. The CFO is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of financial documents and should be prepared to draft letters explaining the documents to stakeholders (investors, the public, etc.) as well as make forward-looking guidance about how the company’s financial health is likely to change in the next quarter, year, and decade. A CFO should be able to apply many different strategic tools such as cost–benefit analysis or SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis to understand the overall position of the company within the market and how it might change into the future.Finance is the catch-all term for the study and management of money and investments. It deals with how governments, companies, and individuals create and acquire money as well as how they spend or invest money. In companies, finance management is the collective action of bookkeepers, accountants, controllers, and the CFO to perform everything from basic invoicing to forecasting into the future.This work is usually done with a suite of specialized software. All of these terms are confusing. They sound similar because they are, and the differences can be fuzzy at best. It isn’t uncommon for these roles to overlap in even midsize companies, especially now with so many useful software platforms to make the jobs easier and more automated.Let’s look at some comparisons to see the difference between the terms.While accounting focuses on the short-term operations of the company, finance takes a longer and broader view. Finance includes the management of assets and liabilities as well as the planning and forecasting of future growth.Accounting is more concerned with drafting budgets based on the input of finance management and then making sure they are followed. Accountants report on the financial condition of the company as opposed to managing it.Bookkeeping can be considered a more administrative and transactional role. It simply records unprocessed information regarding the money coming in and going out as well as revenue and expenses.Accounting takes this information and then collates and visualizes it. While the bookkeeper should be careful to make sure all data is entered correctly, the accountant confirms this by balancing the books and drafting the financial statements.These two roles are very similar. Both finance managers and controllers are responsible for the financial health of the company. However, finance managers are more interested in the financial health of the company and work under the CFO, while controllers are more focused on the management of accounting functions including the reporting of financial documents and supervise accountants and bookkeepers.As your company grows, it can be hard to know exactly when you need to bring on a new team member, and exactly which roles, in which order, should be fulfilled. With the rise of big data, and the sources of big data such as payment processors and CRMs, it is often possible to automate much of the day-to-day accounting and bookkeeping functions. While this doesn’t mean your company can or should resist hiring a bookkeeper or accountant, it does mean that they might not be the first person you should look for. Especially if you are trying to bootstrap a company, keeping another salary off the payroll can help you keep your burn rate low. Conversely, going in search of outside investment might hasten the need for a reputable CFO or experienced controller as investors might need the assurance that such a person brings to the table.Bookkeeping, accounting, and finance management are all necessary tasks for growing businesses. However, the work of bookkeepers, accountants, and controllers can all be aided with the right tools. If you're looking for profit and loss, cash flow, balance sheets and business metrics all in the same tool, look no further. Sign up for FlightPath by Baremetrics and start financial modeling now.\n"

      "11 Tips for Marketing Your Shopify Plugin.\n",
      "Congratulations, you’ve built a useful Shopify plugin! Now what? It’s time to start marketing your Shopify plugin to convert customers and earn revenue.This article will cover helpful tips for marketing SaaS products, including Shopify plugins.There are over 6,000 apps available in the Shopify App Store, which makes it hugely beneficial to shop owners.However, that makes it difficult for potential users to find your app by chance. You are going to need to put a lot of thought into your marketing strategies, experiment regularly, and keep pushing. Here are some tried and true ways to market a Shopify app. People love to feel involved, and building in public is a great way to get an invested audience who is cheering for you to succeed.When building in public, you are inviting people into your inner circle to see how you are building your Shopify plugin and why. The audience gets a front row seat to every step forward you make and every setback you experience.What is particularly useful about building in public is that you have an excuse to start your marketing efforts months before your minimal viable product (MVP) reaches users. Building in public is also a great opportunity to get feedback and buy-in from potential customers. There are loads of apps and marketing platforms that can help you automate, schedule, and release your content across multiple platforms. Every time you release a new graphic on your site, these automation tools can schedule the release of the same content on Instagram. Similarly, you can create a summary post of every new article on your blog to post it on Facebook and LinkedIn simultaneously. A shortened version can also be sent to your Twitter feed. If you make videos for YouTube or podcasts, consider sending links out to Twitter for those as well, and maybe put your best clip on TikTok too. All of this cross-promotion gets you more views. Most people don’t use all the different platforms, so promoting across many social media sites helps you find the biggest audience possible.With automation tools like Later and Hypefury, you can post on more sites in less time. However, be sure that your copy matches the platform. Sometimes a couple minutes going over the Facebook or LinkedIn version is worth it to match the tone of the different sites.While most people marketing their Shopify apps know the value of content marketing, few are utilizing the full variety of content available. One variety that you should be aware of is customer testimonials. Once your Shopify app has engaged users, consider asking them for reviews. After all, social proof is crucial for building trust with potential customers.In my experience, the best time to ask someone for a testimonial is shortly after you have given them some specific help. For example, after your customer service team helps a user with a specific problem or your dev team pushes a requested functionality, send a personalized email to the customer asking them to provide a testimonial to put on your site.Be sure to review the Shopify terms of service here though, as they have very specific rules about testimonials, reviews, ratings, etc., and you don’t want to have your app pulled over an honest mistake.When it comes to marketing, measuring the success of your efforts is key to finding what works best for your company. One way to do this is by using analytics tools that transform data into graphs and charts, like Baremetrics. From there, you should annotate with helpful information. Annotations allow you to add little notes to all your metric charts so that you can quickly see how trends change from various specific points in time. Whenever you introduce marketing experiments, from new ad campaigns and content channels to different pricing schemes, add Annotations to all of your charts in Baremetrics so you can see whether things have changed and how.To use Annotation, simply click on the point in time where something has happened (top left), add in an evocative comment (top right), and then later on you can easily reference trend changes from that point in time (bottom). Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.Your app brings value to specific people and in specific ways. That’s where your focus should be. Consider some of the following questions:Is your plugin a cheaper alternative to a popular one?Does your plugin do some common task faster or more easily?Does your plugin offer functionality to a new market that’s already offered elsewhere?Does your plugin provide all the functionality of a different one but with a more appealing user interface?Does your plugin make your users money?Does your plugin eliminate pain points?Once you know why and how your app adds value and for whom, use that info when marketing your Shopify plug.I’ve been a writer for a while and an editor even longer, so believe me when I say that nobody trusts products with spelling and grammar errors all over the front page.Google will penalize your content as well, which means fewer views on your pages. While there are outsourcing sites around to find good writers and editors, in my experience, it is better to find someone on LinkedIn. There are loads of groups dedicated to freelance writing and editing, and you’ll save money by hiring directly. As an additional bonus, you’ll be able to make long-term relationships with your writers so they can find the voice of your demographic and improve the content even more.When people are searching for an app, they are unlikely to read everything on your Shopify app page. At first scan, they are likely to only read the first sentence or two. So, make those first two sentences count by communicating the value you add. You can hide all of the smaller features lower down the page for when the potential user has narrowed down their search and wants more information.Users are more likely to keep using your Shopify plugin if it has a sleek UX/UI because they are going to find it easier to get the value out of it. Before that, though, they need to find your app. The first point of contact is often your app icon. You should spend some time and money coming up with an app icon that really pops on the page. Make it different, appealing, and descriptive. This is the first point of contact for the majority of your prospects.When thinking about your sales funnel, you start with visitors, who become leads, and those leads are then converted to customers, possibly via your free trial.While the funnel is still important, consider also the marketing flywheel. Your goal should be to maximize your customer lifetime by onboarding clients for the long haul. This means making sure you use the free trial and early months to teach your users how to use your Shopify plugin, how it integrates into their business processes, and why it adds value to their shop.Upselling is often an easier way to increase your MRR than finding new users. That’s one main reason that you should never stop marketing to your current userbase. The other is that it constantly reminds your users about all the value you bring to their enterprise. Happy and engaged customers do not churn.Being a helpful member of the community will gain you trust. When your helpful advice lines up with the functionality of your Shopify plugin, then the community will respond by trying out your product. Be careful to not just come off as self-promoting though, as inauthenticity in the Shopify Community forums (and Reddit too, if you go that route) can ruin any good faith you have gained.Marketing isn’t easy. It can take a long time to figure out exactly who your customers are, where to find them, and what messaging they respond to. But with the right goals, audience, and channels for distribution, you can create a successful marketing funnel for your Shopify plug in. \n",
      "Successful Shopify Partners Apps To Use in 2021.\n",
      "Shopify gambled early and hard on the idea that a community of independent development teams would be able to create a better ecommerce ecosystem than their in-house developers could alone. That gamble was the Shopify Partners Program.And it has clearly paid off. Shopify now boasts over one million shops and 11% of the ecommerce market share. These shops are kept running by various Shopify Partners and their apps, themes, and expertise. In this article, we are going to go through the most successful Shopify Partners Apps. These apps have helped countless business owners and customers come together.Shopify started out with its own suite of 40 apps. These were mostly integrations with established platforms, including MailChimp. When it finally decided to open up the Shopify App Store to Shopify Partners, it created a wishlist of all the apps its customers had been begging for. Well, the dev community answered, and it kept on answering. Now there are several thousand apps available, and more are being vetted, tested, and approved today. This process protects the shop owners while bestowing trust on all apps so business owners feel safe trying new apps. Shopify Partners can provide several different services. Shopify experts spend their time doing anything from setting up stores to providing advice on how to fine tune the store’s SEO or make contact with new overseas suppliers.Shopify Themes is a store where design gurus can provide template store designs to shop owners to simplify the process of having a professional ecommerce destination.The Shopify App Store is where you can find apps to automate or assist in any task a shopkeeper may have.The Shopify App Store has the following categories:Trending appsTop new appsDiscounts, sales, and limited-time offersProduct upsells and cross-sellsNew and noteworthyLoyalty and reviewsMore completed checkoutsAdvertising, influencers, and social mediaSearch engine optimizationOptimized delivery and returnsBroadly speaking, these apps are designed to get more people to the shop, more visitors through the checkout process, or to simplify the process of shop ownership. While there is no foolproof method of vetting the apps both for their quality and for their ability to help a specific shop, there are 2 things you can take to better ensure an app is the right fit for your business. Read the reviews. While only about one in twenty users will write a review, they are usually an indication of the best and worst cases. That’s because happy and angry people are motivated, and motivated people write reviews.Look for apps with a free trial. This will give the shop owner a chance to go through the app, see how it works, and confirm it meets their needs before spending money. Good free trials are usually combined with emails and one-on-one customer service as the app owners want to convert to a sale. If there is none of that added customer service, that can be a red flag.Let’s take a look at some of the most successful Shopify Partner Apps. To make life easier, the apps are divided into the following categories:Email marketingReferral marketingSocial media marketingSEOSales and promotionsLoyalty and reviewsDelivery and returnsConversio sends newsletters, follow up emails, and receipts. Sending receipts is a great extra touchpoint that many shops overlook.It also sells abandoned cart emails, which is an extremely important step in the sales chain.Conversio has a 30-day free trial and then starts at $9/month thereafter.Omnisend uses smart segmentation technology to make sure that each message is sent to only those customers who will find it valuable. Then, it sends those messages out through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook and Google retargeting ads, SMS, web push notifications, etc.It also makes email campaign creation a breeze with its drag-and-drop email builder.Omnisend has a 15-day free trial, a free basic plan, and then variable pricing that starts at $16/month.ReferralCandy provides the functionality to reward customers for sharing your store with their friends. This “social proof” that a store’s products are great can lead to more sales. ReferralCandy has a 30-day free trial and then costs $49/month.Smile.io provides easy-to-use loyalty programs that help brands transform one-time sales into repeat customers. Smile.io has a free tier up to 500 program members and then costs $49-599/month thereafter.Shoelace is designed to retarget a prospective customer audience on Facebook, Instagram, or using Google Ads until the customers come to the store and make a purchase.Shoelace starts at $79/month for automations, $420/month for their retargeting program, and increases for more personalized help from there.Kit is a chatbot that can help run Facebook or Instagram ads. The user simply sends Kit messages about their desired ad campaign, and then Kit does the rest.Kit is a free app.Google Images is now the second most used search engine (after Google, obviously), and image optimization best practices still lag behind those for written content. SEO Image Optimizer gives you the ability to add alt tags to images so they rank better and more often.SEO Image Optimizer is free for all users.Plug In SEO is a simple alarm system that alerts the user when there are any issues with their SEO. It then directs the user to the problems so they can be fixed.Plug In SEO is free, but you can upgrade to Plug In SEO plus for $20/monthPrisync monitors your competitors’ prices and then uses a set of user-defined rules to dynamically change the prices in a shop in real time so the store remains competitive.PriSync has a 14-day free trial, then has a $129/month premium plan and $229/month platinum plan.ReCharge is designed for stores that have recurring billing. For example, a shop that sells subscription boxes can use ReCharge to automate those recurring invoices.ReCharge has a free-to-install tier that charges 1% + 10¢ per transaction and a Pro tier that charges $300/month in addition to 1% + 19¢ per transaction. Judge.me helps store owners collect and display star ratings and reviews about their products.Judge.me has a free tier and then a second tier that costs $15/month.Rivo helps shops engage with their customers to increase sales without a higher marketing spend.Rivo has a free tier and then paid tiers at $29/month and $49/month.Alpaca Local Pickup & delivery provides curbside pickup and local delivery functionality for stores that sell to local customers online and offline.Alpaca Local Pickup & delivery has a 14-day free trial and starts at $19/month thereafter.Returnly provides a fully automated return process for Shopify shops. Returnly has a 14-day free trial and then starts at $29/month with pricing based on the store owner’s Shopify tier.Whatever category your successful Shopify Partner Apps fall into, you need to track its growth metrics. To do this, you need an analytics tool that integrates directly with your Shopify account, like Baremetrics. Start a free trial today. \n"

      "10 Business Tips for Shopify App Developers.\n",
      "Building a Shopify app can be challenging. Unfortunately, things only get more difficult when it comes to running the whole business as a Shopify app developer.But, nobody said making money would be easy. Thankfully, there are proven ways to build and grow a sustainable business. This article will cover 10 business tips for improving your Shopify app’s development, marketing, and sales. I’m going to walk you through some of the top-level ideas that can make micro-SaaS development a little bit more manageable. The overriding theme here is that you need to be flexible. Let’s say you want to have your minimum viable product (MVP) submitted to Shopify for vetting in two months. What do you do first? Would the decision change if you had six months? What about if you only had seven days?It shouldn’t! Whatever your timeline, the first step needs to be planning. Having a solid, reasonable timeline keeps all of your team members focused on what they need to be doing and your company progressing on pace.An effective plan should include the time required to: Scope an existing need for Shopify merchantsLook at the competing apps in the Shopify App StoreFigure out what tools you needDecide what work can be done in-house and what work might need to be outsourced Your planning should also include a strong understanding of your target market and why they need your app. As I’ve said, you need to know your audience. This includes not only the type of merchants that will benefit from your app but also the person inside that company who will be using your app.Are you targeting marketers? Designers? Sales? Understanding the end user of your app will affect every decision you make, from how your UX/UI looks to your marketing and pricing strategy. Whether you are spending nights during school or after work building your Shopify app or leaving a stable job to do it full time, you need to have a big goal in mind to keep you focused.Without some deeper goals in place, it can be hard to keep driving towards a finish line when missteps occur.Keeping yourself focused on the value you will give to the community when the Shopify QA team sends your app back for more work will help you pick yourself up and keep moving forward.When you start developing an app, the road ahead seems so clear. You’ve identified a user base with a problem, came up with a solution, as well as how to build that solution. Then, you hit a snag. Maybe someone else releases a competing app, maybe Shopify has updated its platform in some way that removes the problem, or maybe it is that the problem isn’t all that easy to solve. Whatever the issue, you need to move on.Usually, it isn’t something so extreme. It could be something as small as your pricing scheme. Let’s say you release your app with two price tiers, a basic tier and a more expensive tier with more features. But nobody seems to be buying. What’s the problem? Are you not attracting the right leads? Are you too expensive? While that could be it, it could also be that the basic tier doesn’t have the “magic sauce” that helps your app bring value to customers, while jumping to the pro tier is off-putting.What do you do? Price optimization can mean changing the prices of your tiers, but it can also mean changing your pricing model entirely.For example, a freemium model where users don’t pay to use the app but have to upgrade in order to access more features might be successful. Often, the right pricing model can not only get you more customers, but more revenue per customer, as well. The over 6,000 apps in the Shopify App Store have been vetted by the Shopify QA team. While that can make things nerve-racking when you are waiting to hear about approval, it also bestows a great deal of trust on each and every app. Shop owners can be confident when downloading your app thanks to the QA team. The QA team will also give you guidance on how to get your app up to snuff if it isn’t there yet. They’ll provide you with logs, screen caps, identify issues, and offer help on how to fix them.That guidance is invaluable during the vetting process. Before that, they are also there to offer help and encouragement during the entire development process. Don’t be afraid to reach out. As Shopify app developers, you should be engaging with the Shopify team. It is super helpful.To turn app development from a hobby into a business, you need to make money. Maximizing profit requires tracking your growth metrics. Baremetrics can track all of your needed growth metrics. Just look at this image of the SaaS quick ratio:Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to Shopify and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.While this can’t always work, you don’t want to wake up months behind schedule with a dozen features all half completed. You definitely don’t want to then release your app and find most of those features ignored. Even the best and most mature apps only have a handful of major functions. Those are the functions that attract leads and get users to pay monthly for your service. The rest, while often helpful, is more “nice to have” than “need to have”.Focusing on the features you are confident will be the center of your marketing campaign is a good way to get yourself in business as Shopify app developers. The rest can come over time.Your star rating and the number of ratings and reviews you’ve received are the cornerstone of your app’s success. While customer service is important in every industry, the risk of early poor ratings might be greater in the Shopify App Store than anywhere else.It is better to grow slowly while maintaining peak customer service than go too fast and find yourself with a low rating. Don’t be surprised if you never develop the app you envisioned at the start. That’s ok. The feedback loop of research-development-research-development means you will almost certainly experience a pivot or two.That’s ok. Every time you move away from an idea towards a better one, that’s a success. I discuss this more in an article about marketing, but building in the open is a great way to find early fans. By keeping the community in the loop (through the Shopify Community forums, social media, your blog, etc.) about what you are developing and why, you can start the marketing and sales cycle even before your app is complete.You’ll also know immediately when what you are building is off the mark because your followers will tell you. In this way, you can avoid a lot of dead-end development and focus on what your future users really want.Even growth metric tells a Shopify app developer something about their company’s financial health. To get the whole picture, you need to track as many as possible.However, doing all of this by hand takes time, leaving you less of the day available for development, customer service, marketing, and all the other important functions as Shopify app developers you need to accomplish.That’s where Baremetrics comes in. Baremetrics can track all of your needed growth metrics and display them one on dashboard.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n",

      "There are some amazing, comprehensive guidebooks out there for building a Shopify app (including this one from Shopify). Consider this the cheat sheet on building a Shopify app. In this article, I’ll provide you with a summary of the process of building an app, from planning the functionality to marketing your Shopify app and tracking its growth.Whatever Shopify app you choose to build, Baremetrics is the tool you should use to monitor its growth metrics.When it comes to monitoring all of the needed growth metrics for your Shopify app, Baremetrics excels.

I’m going to go over each of them below. The stages:Research and planningUnderstanding the Shopify app ecosystemValidating your Shopify appDesigning your Shopify appSubmitting your app to the Shopify App StoreMonitoring your appI touch on this a bit in another article with helpful business tips for Shopify app developers, but it is worth repeating here.Before you start developing an app, you need to have a plan in place. The plan should include a timeline of all the tasks that need to be completed, how long they will take, and a logical progression where tasks that rely on other tasks being completed occur after the requisite tasks. No matter the schedule you plan to keep, a solid plan will keep you on track during the entire process. The first part of your plan should encompass research. This research should include two main parts.First, you’ll need to understand what it takes to build your app, get the app approved, and market and track your app’s growth over time. While this article goes over this part briefly, you’ll need to read the complete guide on the Shopify website to fully grasp the task.Second, you’ll want to understand the market you are entering. For this, I recommend considering the following questions:What is my target market?What other apps are competing for this target market?What specific value will my app bring that differentiates it from the other apps?How much can I expect to earn per user per month?While it is best to build your Shopify app with the goal of adding value to the Shopify Community, understanding the expected monthly revenue per user will tell you how much you can budget for development, how much you can spend acquiring customers (CAC), and how long you can expect to wait to be in the black.Shopify is a stellar ecommerce ecosystem. It makes it incredibly easy for anyone to start a business. However, not even Shopify can anticipate the needs of every shop owner or build the functionality they need to excel.This is the positioning of the Shopify app ecosystem. When building a Shopify app, you are providing further functionality to the Shopify ecosystem.Your Shopify app enters this ecosystem by connecting with one or more of the Shopify APIs and thus extending the ecosystem’s capabilities to the benefit of shop owners and customers.During the research and planning phase, you should have come up with a good app idea. A good idea checks the following four boxes:This app solves a real merchant problem.The target market is currently trying to solve this problem in a less efficient way.Merchants are willing to pay money to solve this problem.Our dev team can build this app.Before moving forward with your plan, it is worth taking a second look at your app, the market, and the Shopify ecosystem to make sure that your app has a marketable niche to exploit.It is also important to understand whether it is possible to build the app—and if so that your dev team has the skills to do so.I’m going to break this into two parts, the UX/UI decision making and the general presentation.When it comes time to design your UX/UI, consider the following to ensure your app provides the best possible experience: Your UX/UI design should be both functional and visually appealing. Your app should provide clear and simple copy.Your app should be inclusive and accessible. For the general presentation, you need to make sure that your app uses appropriate language. English is the most spoken language on Earth, but most people of those people are not native English speakers. You should use plain English free of complex words or jargon. Once you have a solid English base, consider providing your app in other languages, such as Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, French, and Arabic, which are the next most spoken languages.Before you start building your app, you will definitely need the following:A Shopify Partner account and development storeAn ngrok accountYou will also need the following general skills:The ability to use your computer’s command line and text editorThe ability to code in a backend programming language, such as PHP, Node.JS, Java, Python, or Ruby on RailsThe ability to install software using the npm package managerIn addition to these skills and assets, there are loads of additional Shopify and third-party tools available to help build and manage the build of your Shopify app. I encourage you to spend time (a lot of time) reading everything provided by Shopify as it is immensely helpful.The submission process is long and arduous. Shopify takes great care to vet every new app to make sure it does what the developers claim it does, and safely and within all laws. While this can be a frustrating process for the developers, it is necessary for shop owners to true the over 6,000 Shopify apps currently available. You should put your frustration aside because the Shopify QA team is actually super helpful and wants you to succeed. Listen to them!To the point, you need to ensure the following three steps have been performed before submitting your app:Your app meets Shopify’s app requirements.You have written a thorough and accurate app listing.Your app has been tested in many different use cases successfully.Monitoring your app means two things. The first entails keeping track of your app’s market growth and the second is to ensure your app remains compatible with the ever-changing Shopify ecosystem so that it remains safe and functioning.Shopify recommends the AARRR (acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, and referral) metric system in their guidebook as a good way to track your business growth. When building your metrics tech stack, you should sign up for Baremetrics.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with Shopify, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.I’ve compiled a list of some frequently asked questions I see online about building a Shopify app.The short answer is no. Shopify is language-agnostic. However, Shopify provides official libraries for Ruby and Python. Third-party libraries are also available for Node, PHP, and some other languages. So, if you are new to coding, then these languages might be the best place to start. If you are a seasoned coder, then you might find using these languages faster given the ample assets available.The first thing you should do is read the Complete Guide Book provided by Shopify including all of the associated supplementary pages (warning: it is long). You’ll need to learn a language, and while Shopify is language-agnostic, Ruby or Python is usually considered the easiest to start with. Once your app is built, you’ll need to market it, provide customer service, maintain and further develop its functionality, pay associated hosting fees, and monitor its financials.In addition, Shopify takes a percentage of the revenue over a high threshold.Public apps are widely available and can be listed in the Shopify App Store. Custom apps are made specifically and solely for a single merchant and are not listed in the Shopify App Store. Private apps are designed for a limited segment of merchants and are not listed in the Shopify App Store.There are so many great tools available for building a Shopify app, which is why I wrote a separate article just on this topic. Many of the best tools for developing apps come from Shopify, including their Polaris and REST Admin API playgrounds, sample apps, and data generators. Beyond that, you’ll also want to check out general productivity tools, such as Slack, Notion, and Trello. Once your app is up and running, you are going to need tools to track your revenue growth and metrics. This is where Baremetrics is essential as part of your metrics tech stack.Whatever app you decide to build, the development is only the start. Once completed, you’ll need to market your app and track your revenue progress.  This is difficult to do alone, which is why you should use Baremetrics.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many users, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you. Baremetrics can even monitor your SaaS quick ratio. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your Shopify Partners company, and you can start a free trial today.\n"

      "Top 10 tools for Shopify App Developers (2021).\n",
      "Shopify has become the preeminent ecommerce platform. With that, developers have been hurrying to Shopify to get their apps into the Shopify App Store.But what are the best tools for Shopify App Developers in 2021? In this article, we are going to go over the 10 best tools for Shopify App Developers (plus a bonus one). And unlike most of the lists, there is no filler here!Some of the best tools for Shopify App Developers are provided by Shopify! This shouldn’t be surprising as Shopify has progressively worked toward the success of its developers and shop owners. For example, they take zero cut of the first million per year in revenue. The following is a list of some of the tools for Shopify App Developers provided by Shopify:Speaking of tools for Shopify App Developers provided by Shopify, Shopify also provides a repository of sample apps.These apps are built using a variety of languages and showcase some of the functionality that Shopify App Developers can implement in their apps.The following is a list of some of the sample apps provided by Shopify:When you are developing an app for Shopify, you probably want to test how it works in a real store. These development stores offer you a free simulated experience for testing apps. This gives you valuable experience seeing how the app will interact in a real environment long before you even think about submitting your app for approval. However, if you need to create all of the data to populate the store by hand, then a quick and easy tool for Shopify App Developers becomes its own time-consuming task.That’s the beauty of the Data Generator found in the Shopify Developer Tools. All of the data generated for the development store can accomplish two things:According to Shopify, the REST Admin API is their most robust API. The REST Admin API playground provided by Shopify allows you to explore how it works.With this playground, you can make authenticated API calls using sample or custom requests to any of your connected stores. While the first five tools for Shopify App Developers discussed here help you design, build, test, and implement your app, Baremetrics is the best tool for tracking its growth.Once you have an approved app in the Shopify App Shop, you’ll need a way to keep track of your subscription revenue, customers, and so much more. That’s when Baremetrics becomes your tool of choice.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, LTV, total customers, and even the quick ratio directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.The Chrome Developer Tools (or DevTools) are super helpful for building Shopify apps. Since they are built into Google Chrome, DevTools offer a quick way to diagnose coding problems with ease. Sublime Text is more than just a text editor. This is one of the most preferred coding platforms for so many reasons.Sublime Text helps you speed up the coding process, perform multiple selections at once, change multiple lines, or rename variables. It is very responsive and allows split editing for easier side-by-side coding. In addition to its custom-built components, it allows you to easily access packages developed by the programming community.GitHub is more than a platform. It is a community of developers who provide tools to other developers. On GitHub, you can find solutions to almost any problem while building software.This is also true for Shopify apps, making it one of the best tools for Shopify App Developers.On Github, developers can create their own repositories, or fork existing codes to create their own custom tweaks. They may also integrate their Github repo with an app like Rewind to ensure SOC2 compliance when dealing with customer data.While we have mostly focused on tools Shopify App Developers use when programming their apps, it is important to remember that most of these apps are collaborations. Even when in the same office, communication can be difficult. It can be hard to get all of the needed personnel into a meeting at the same time, and often the notes from that meeting disappear into the ether. When your whole team is remote, across many time zones, it can be even harder to communicate. That’s why successful Shopify App Developers also use tools for communication. Slack is one of the most important communication tools in the modern workplace, whether that’s in the office or around the world. Slack incorporates many different existing communication tools into a single platform, making it one of the easiest ways to boost productivity. You can have group or private chats—or one just for you if you need to jot down notes quickly.You can drag and drop files to transfer them to the community easily. There’s also a handy search function so messages aren’t lost because someone entered the chat late or a barrage of messages came all at once.This is another great communication tool for use when developers are working in different places or at different times. Trello helps your team track all of the projects currently in the workflow, which ones rely on others, and when they all need to be completed. You can back up data from Trello to Excel or integrate Trello with other platforms to keep projects' data, check performance and progress statuses, use it for analytics purposes, and more.Whatever tools you use to build your successful Shopify App, you need to track its growth metrics to make sure it is bringing you the most value possible. This is difficult to do alone, which is why you should use Baremetrics.\n",
      "Top 10 Business Metrics for Shopify App Developers.\n",
      "Shopify is a huge opportunity for developers looking to expand into the micro-SaaS space. The Shopify App Store brings together Shopify app developers and Shopify shop owners for their mutual benefit. To get the most out of the time and money invested into their apps, Shopify App Developers need to track the core metrics of their industry. Business metrics are simply the key performance indicators (KPIs) used by managers in decision making. They distill some part of the business into an easy-to-read value that can be benchmarked against the industry, competitors, or internally over time.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to Shopify and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.Business metrics are fundamentally a way to answer questions about the health of your company. Each of the business metrics you track should answer a simple question about your company.As Shopify App Developers, you should track these business metrics over time so that you can be happy with the answers.Let’s look at the top 10 business metrics for Shopify App Developers and the questions they answer:Monthly recurring revenue (MRR): How much subscription revenue are you bringing in monthly?Churn: How quickly are you losing customers or revenue?Average revenue per unit (ARPU): How much do you earn per customer on average per period?Customer lifetime value (LTV): How much value does your average customer bring during the lifetime of their contract?Quick ratio: How efficiently is your business increasing its MRR?Customer acquisition cost (CAC): What does it cost to onboard a new customer?Lead velocity rate (LVR): Is your sales funnel improving?Lead conversion rate: How many of your leads convert into paying clients?Star rating: How much do your customers love you?Users to ratings ratio: How in love with your product are your customers?Here we will walk you through the 10 business metrics for Shopify App Developers that you should be tracking.Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is how much subscription revenue your app is bringing in over a month. It is one of the core metrics of micro-SaaS companies that use a subscription revenue model. Calculating your MRR is pretty simple on paper. You just take your total number of customers and multiply it by the average revenue per user (ARPU), which is how much your average customer pays for your app monthly.MRR = Number of Customers × ARPULet’s say you have 20 customers. The average customer pays $100 per month. Then, your MRR would be 20 × $100 = $2,000.This looks simple on paper, but your MRR can change drastically month to month, with some factors increasing and others decreasing your MRR. We will look at this a bit more under the quick ratio.Baremetrics can show you your MRR automatically:Customer churn and revenue churn tell you how much you are losing monthly from your recurring revenue stream. Customer churn is the percentage of your clients leaving each month: Customer Churn = (Churned Customers/Total Customers at the beginning of the month) × 100Revenue churn is the percentage of your MRR leaving each month:Revenue Churn = (Churned Revenue/MRR at the beginning of the month) × 100Churn is important for calculating your LTV. Reducing churn, especially involuntary churn, can often be cheaper than increasing sales, so this business metric should always be tracked.Baremetrics can show you your churn automatically:ARPU is simply the amount of money the average customer pays you per month. You can calculate ARPU by dividing your MRR by the number of active users:ARPU = MRR/Active CustomersARPU can be difficult to calculate if you have a complicated pricing system. For example, if you have multiple tiers, add-ons, and usage pricing, then it will be more difficult to anticipate how much revenue your average user is generating per month in advance.Baremetrics can show you your ARPU automatically:The lifetime value (LTV) is the average revenue generated by your users during the entire time they subscribe to your app. It can be calculated in two ways.Method 1:LTV = ARPU × Customer LifetimeMethod 2:LTV = ARPU/Customer ChurnLTV is immensely important for calculating your CAC budget, which is discussed a bit more under CAC.Baremetrics can show you your LTV automatically:To understand the quick ratio, you need to understand MRR and all the components that affect its movement from month to month.Let’s look all of these MRR components:New MRR is the additional MRR from new customers.Expansion MRR is the additional MRR from existing customers (also known as “upgrade MRR”).Churned MRR is the MRR lost from cancellations.Reactivation MRR is the additional MRR from churned customers who have reactivated their account.Contraction MRR is the MRR lost from existing customers due to downgrades.In the simplest terms, the quick ratio tells you how your app is growing. It is essentially the sum of all the good MRR types divided by the total of all the bad MRR types:Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR + Reactivation MRR) ÷ (Contraction MRR + Churned MRR)Baremetrics can show you your quick ratio automatically:It can be difficult to calculate all the different business metrics for Shopify App Developers. That’s why you should use Baremetrics to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for Shopify Partners. Baremetrics can integrate directly with Shopify and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, and more. Best of all, it can calculate your quick ratio automatically!Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.CAC is one of the most important business metrics for Shopify App Developers. CAC represents the total cost to onboard a new paying customer. It can include everything from your sales and marketing expenses per new customer to the per customer cost of running your free trial. Let’s look at the CAC formula:CAC = Money Spent Acquiring New Customers/Number of New CustomersCAC is an important metric, but it needs to be combined with others to give you the most information possible. For example, the CAC payback period tells you the number of months it takes for your company to earn back what it spent on acquiring the new user.In addition, the LTV to CAC ratio tell you whether you are finding new users sustainably. The LTV to CAC ratio should stabilize at 4 or higher to ensure your growth is sustainable.LVR tells you whether you are finding more qualified leads every month than the last. Quality leads are those visitors to your site who have expressed interest in your product and been vetted by your sales and/or marketing teams as having a genuine interest in using your app.The following is the lead velocity rate formula:LVR = ((Number of Qualified Leads This Month – Number of Qualified Leads Last Month) ÷Number of Qualified Leads Last Month) × 100%The lead conversion rate is the number of leads who eventually become customers. Let’s look at the lead conversion rate formula:Lead Conversion Rate = (Number of New Customers/Number of Leads) × 100%While most people might not think about star rating as a business metric for Shopify App Developers, there is nothing more important to the sustainability of your app business. To crawl up the Shopify App Store rankings, it is paramount that you maintain a five-star rating. Customers usually only rate apps when they are motivated to by good or bad experiences, so be sure that you have stellar customer service.It can be frustrating trying to get users to rate your app, and even harder to get them to write a review. About 1 in 20 users on average will leave a rating, but if you nudge them with just the right messaging at just the right frequency, you can get more reviews.To get the best and most ratings possible, consider sending an email request right after your customer service team fulfills some concerns.All business metrics for Shopify App Developers aim to answer one or more questions, which is why you need to track several to get a better picture of your business. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with Shopify, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "What Is Unearned Revenue and How to Account for It.\n",
      "In this article, I am going to go over the ins and outs of unearned revenue, when you should recognize revenue, and why it is a liability. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about accounting as I’ll illustrate everything with some examples.\n",
      "Customer Lifetime Value and Customer Lifetime Care.\n",
      "Customer lifetime value (CLV) is one of the main metrics SaaS companies track to monitor their profitability and growth. CLV is simply the average amount of revenue you can expect to generate from a single customer before they churn.In this article, I am going to go through what CLV is, how to calculate CLV, why CLV is important, and how to maximize your CLV by tending to your customers following the “retention” part of the AARRR pirate metrics.Note that customer lifetime value is alternatively abbreviated as CLV, LTV, and CLTV. I’ll try to stick to CLV here, but Baremetrics generally uses LTV so you might see that in some screenshots.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, CLV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to your payment processor, including Shopify and Stripe, and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.All of these features collectively help you give personalized care to your customers to maximize the length of their contracts.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.Just look at the dashboard with all the metrics Baremetrics provides:CLV is simply the average amount of revenue a customer pays you before they churn.This can be calculated using the average revenue per user (ARPU) and the average customer lifetime as follows:CLV = ARPU × Customer LifetimeFor example, if your ARPU is $100/month and your average contract length is 12 months, then your CLV would be $100 × 12 = $1,200. This leads to the question: How do you get to an ARPU of $100 or a contract length of 12 months?Unfortunately, you can’t know the contract length of a customer until they quit. You also can’t know the average customer lifetime until a significant number of customers churn.That means that using ARPU and customer lifetime to calculate CLV only works with quite mature companies. When your SaaS company is just starting out, you need to use a different method to calculate your CLV.As a startup, you can calculate your CLV using customer churn. Customer churn is the percentage of customers that leave your platform in a given month:Customer Churn = (Churned Customers/Total Customers) × 100%For example, if you have 500 customers and 25 customers leave your site over the course of a month, then your customer churn is: (25/500) × 100% = 5%.By dividing your ARPU by customer churn, you can get your CLV:CLV = ARPU/Customer ChurnIf your customers are paying the same amount monthly as above ($100), then your 5% churn gives you a CLV of 100/0.05 = $2,000. Note that in the calculation you should use churn as a decimal not a percentage.I’ve just given you the formulas required to calculate your CLV, but how do you get those numbers? The following is the four-step procedure to figure out your CLV.Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is the average amount you earn in subscription revenue per month. This is probably the single most important growth metric you’ll track.MRR can change a lot month to month. To get a good baseline of the current month’s MRR, calculate your MRR for the previous couple months and follow the trend to get the best possible representation of the current month’s MRR.Your ARPU is likely to jump around as customers switch between different tiers, try different add-ons, are charged different amounts of usage or overages, etc.That’s why it is a handy trick to use your MRR to calculate your ARPU.All your need to do is divide your MRR by the number of users of your app to get your ARPU:ARPU = MRR/Total Number of CustomersCustomer retention is the opposite of customer churn. It is the percentage of customers that stick with your service during the current month. This gives you your churn for calculating CLV.Simply take your ARPU and divide it by your customer churn to get your CLV.While this four-step process might sound easy in principle, keeping all of that information accurate and up to date by hand is anything but. Out of date or unreliable data will turn your CLV into just another vanity metric.That’s why you need a metrics dashboard to do the hard work for you.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for Shopify Partners. Baremetrics can integrate directly with Shopify and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, the total number of customers, total expenses, and more. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Baremetrics can even display your customer lifetime value:CLV is useful for so many reasons, but let’s look at just a few of them in detail.Keeping track of your CLV helps you determine the specific value of different customers. This way you can provide special customer care to those customers that are the most valuable to your company.It can also help you determine which products, service plans, etc. are providing the most revenue. If some of your features aren’t being used while others are driving major traffic, then you can change your future development plan to match the tools demanded by the market.By seeing just how much added value can be generated by increasing the length of time your average customer maintains their contract, you will spend more time and resources on customer care.The opposite side of this greater emphasis on customer service is that your customers will be more loyal and adoring. Since referrals, testimonials, and positive reviews are key parts of any strong inbound marketing campaign, having customers that truly love your service will increase your long-term profitability.The best way to find more customers is to have a well-defined ideal customer profile (ICP). It is also the best way to ensure a long average customer lifetime because the customers that get the most value out of your service are the ones that will stay signed up the longest.CLV is at its most valuable when it is combined with customer acquisition cost (CAC). CAC is the average cost of getting one new paid customer. CLV is often combined with CAC as the CLV to CAC ratio. A CLV to CAC ratio of 3 (which means you earn $3 in CLV for every $1 spent on CAC) is generally considered sustainable. Your CLV to CAC ratio should improve over time so don’t fret if you aren’t meeting the benchmark to start. However, if your CLV to CAC ratio doesn’t seem to be improving, then you need to make changes. You need to find a cheaper way to get new customers, increase your prices, or decrease your churn.Customer retention is the most important thing you can work on. That’s because it is way more expensive to find new customers than keep current ones happy—some estimates put it as high as 25 times more expensive! That’s why you need to identify your customers at risk of churn quickly and focus on them. Baremetrics has a couple of great products to help reduce churn.Customer Insights helps you separate out different groups. By filtering for customers similar to those that have churned, you can figure out why and take positive actions to prevent the loss of more customers.Take a look:CLV is an important metric that is needed for decision making throughout the company. CLV is used to calculate your CAC budget, and its components ARPU and churn are used in many of your growth metrics. However, CLV is only part of the picture. Without a host of other metrics, it is hard to make optimal decisions. Calculating CLV, along with all of these other metrics, directly on Stripe or Shopify can be difficult. So, whatever payment processor or CRM you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.\n"

      "How to Calculate LTV for Shopify Partner Apps.\n",
      "Following in the footsteps of Amazon, Shopify first began its journey as a simple online shop, selling snowboards. That’s probably not surprising for a company founded in the winter wonderland of Ottawa!Shopify has built a strong network of Shopify Partners to expand the functionality of the ecosystem. Shopify Partner Apps are third party companies that sell their services or Apps to Shopify store owners. For example, a Shopify Partner App might enable a shopify store owner to email all of their customers. This app owner charges a subscription fee to their customers (who are Shopify store owners) and collects a monthly or annual fee based on the plan size of their service. This article is for Shopify Partner App developers and how to calculate LTV for your subscription customers. Let’s dive into how to calculate LTV for Shopify Partner Apps.One of the most important metrics for Shopify Partners is customer lifetime value (LTV). The lifetime value of a customer is just that—the total amount of revenue earned by the average customer during the duration of their contract. On the surface it is a simple concept, but calculating the average revenue per user (ARPU), customer lifetime, and customer churn, which are necessary components of the LTV calculation, is complicated because the information is coming from many sources.This complication can only increase when your customers tend to change pricing tiers, purchase add-ons, or you implement usage-based pricing.But, where do Shopify Partners track the metrics of their app?Thankfully, when it comes to calculating LTV for Shopify Partner Apps, along with all of the related metrics, Baremetrics excels. There is no need to calculate LTV for Shopify Partner Apps by hand because Baremetrics can do it for you.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, ARPU, churn, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Just check out how easy it is right here:The lifetime value (LTV) is the average revenue generated by your users during the entire time they subscribe to your app. It can be calculated in two ways.The average revenue per user (ARPU) is the amount of money your average customer generates per month. The customer lifetime is the average number of months your users continue to subscribe to your app. For example, if your ARPU is $200/month and your average customer lifetime is 30 months, then your LTV would be $200 × 30 = $6000. While the math is easy, getting the numbers isn’t.A customer’s lifetime can only be known for sure after they churn. The average customer lifetime can only be known after a statistically significant number of customers have churned. That’s where Method 2 can come in handy. For example, if you have 2000 users and 100 leave your site over the course of a month, then your customer churn is: (100/2000) × 100 = 5%.Using the same ARPU as above ($200), then the 5% churn value, written in decimal form (0.05), would give you an LTV of $200/0.05 = $4000.Finally, it should be mentioned that ARPU is also not easy to calculate. While in any given month you can take your MRR and divide it by the total number of customers, this doesn’t give you enough information for LTV.Since pricing optimization means that you probably won’t charge the same amount for your app forever, your customers can jump between different tiers, and there might be add-ons or usage pricing, among many other issues, calculating an accurate ARPU value by hand, and therefore an accurate LTV, is impossible.Since LTV is used for many other metrics, not to mention is central to every decision you’ll make from budgeting for customer acquisition cost (CAC) to pricing, further developing your app, and everything in between, this number needs to be as accurate as possible. It can be difficult to calculate all of your needed revenue, customer, churn, and MRR movement metrics including LTV for Shopify Partner Apps. That’s why it is important to use Baremetrics to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for Shopify Partners. Baremetrics can integrate directly with Shopify and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.As mentioned above, LTV gives you the most information when it is combined with customer acquisition cost (CAC). CAC is the average cost of getting one new paid customer. The LTV to CAC ratio tells you what percentage of the revenue generated from the average user is spent getting them to sign up for a paid subscription. For example, it costs you $2500 in advertising, content marketing, customer service outreach, and running the free trial to get a customer to sign up for your app. The average user spends $15,000 on your app subscription before they churn. Then, your LTV to CAC ratio is $15,000/$2500 = 6. An LTV to CAC ratio of 3 (i.e., you earn $3 for every $1 spent on CAC) is generally considered sustainable, so in this case you are doing very well.While an LTV to CAC ratio of under 3 is not uncommon for new companies (it takes a long time to generate good word of mouth, find the bugs to keep users from churning, and get enough five-star ratings to show up at the top of the Shopify Partners App Store), long term it is a problem. If your LTV to CAC ratio is lower than 3, then you need to answer one or more of the following questions:How can I keep my users happy and subscribed for longer?How can I improve my sales and marketing funnel to increase my conversion rate?How can I increase the amount I earn per user per month?To succeed here, you need to segment your client population and direct different actions to each group.Trying to calculate your LTV for Shopify Partner Apps, as well as the other needed SaaS metrics, alone can be difficult. It also leads to coarser calculations that reduce the actionability of your metrics. For example, it is important to understand the variation in your LTV based on different segments of your customers, such as shop age, location, average price point, service tier subscribed to, etc. This is something that Baremetrics can do automatically. Calculating metrics by segment allows you to target your actions more effectively. Here are some examples. If your American users are keeping their services three times longer than those in the UK, you might want to figure out what value Americans are getting out of your service that the British are not. If your annual subscribers are far less likely to churn than monthly users, then you might want to increase the discount you offer for paying on an annual basis. If you offer three tiers and the cheapest one has a very low LTV compared to the others, then you might want to scrap it. It could be that the reduced functionality removes that magic element that makes your app worth using and forcing clients to upgrade would get them to see the true value of the platform you provide and increase their longevity. You can easily segment your Shopify customers in Baremetrics. Check out our segmentation tool here:LTV is used for decision making throughout the company. LTV is used to calculate your CAC budget, and its components ARPU and churn are used in many of your growth metrics. However, LTV is only part of the picture.

      "What is Net Revenue Retention.\n",
      "Net revenue retention (NRR) and gross revenue retention (GRR) are two important metrics. NRR reflects your ability to retain and expand the monthly spend of customers, while GRR indicates only your ability to retain customers.An easy way to look at it is like this:NRR: How well do you sell to current customers?GRR: How well do you keep your customers happy?NRR and GRR are important secondary metrics for any SaaS enterprise that brings in money through a subscription revenue model.In this article, I will explain NRR and GRR, present their formulas, provide examples of NRR and GRR calculations, and the implications of an NRR focus versus GRR focus.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources, and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.Revenue retention is the amount of revenue you have this period because it was also there last period.For example, if a customer signs up for your service in March and stays in April, then the amount they spend in April is part of your retained revenue.While I mention a customer here, note that revenue retention and customer retention are not the same thing. If you have 20 customers spending $30/month, then your customer retention is 20, while your revenue retention is 20 × $30 = $600.However, if you have a tiered pricing or usage pricing model, add-ons, or some other variability in pricing, then these numbers can change independently and both require attention.For example, if you have the same 20 customers paying $30/month in March, but in April you have 15 customers with 10 paying $30/month and 5 now paying $75/month, then your customer retention has decreased to 18, while your revenue retention has increased to $30 × 10 + 5 × $75 = $675.In this simple explanation, I have presented the revenue and customer retention as numbers, but usually NRR and GRR are presented as a percentage, i.e. the rate of change from one month to the next.Let’s look at the math behind net revenue retention, gross retention revenue, and customer retention.As mentioned in the introduction, NRR is an indication of your company’s ability to retain and expand contracts. In this sense, it is similar to the SaaS quick ratio, which is also calculated using the different influences on MRR (monthly recurring revenue).Whereas the quick ratio includes all of the following components, NRR omits New MRR and Reactivation MRR:New MRR is the additional MRR from new customers.Expansion MRR is the additional MRR from existing customers (also known as “upgrade MRR”).Churned MRR is the MRR lost from cancellations.Reactivation MRR is the additional MRR from churned customers who have reactivated their account.Contraction MRR is the MRR lost from existing customers due to downgrades.Let’s look at the NRR formula:For example, you start March with an MRR of $50,000. Some of your customers upgrade adding $10,000 in revenue. Some customers churn leading to a loss of $3,000 in revenue, while other customers downgrade leading to $2,000 in contractions.In this case, NRR = ((50,000 + 10,000) – (3,000 + 2,000)) ÷ 50,000 × 100% = 110%.An NRR above 110% is an indication that you are experiencing MRR growth from current customers, which is great!Unlike NRR, GRR only shows your ability to retain customers. Hence, in addition to New MRR and Reactivation MRR, GRR also omits Expansion MRR.Let’s look at the equation: Let’s use the same example as above. Omitting the $10,000 in expansions, GRR = ((50,000) – (3,000 + 2,000)) ÷ 50,000 × 100% = 90%.Since GRR is capped at 100% or your NRR, whichever is lower, a GRR of 90% is pretty good. The closer it is to 100%, the better.The customer retention rate is sometimes calculated instead of GRR because it is much simpler and provides a similar snapshot of your growth trajectory.Let’s look at the formula:Let’s take the same example again. Instead of $50,000 of MRR, consider there are 1,000 customers each paying $50/month. Then, 100 customers ($5000/$50) decide to leave the platform at the end of the month. Here, the customer retention rate is (1 – (100/1,000) × 100% = 90%.While this example is meant to be straightforward to see why customer retention rate can replace GRR, if your customers are paying different amounts, then there can be a variance between the numbers.For example, if your high-ticket customers are more likely to churn, then your customer retention rate will be better than your GRR. Conversely, if your lower-tier customers are more likely to churn, then your GRR will be better than your customer retention rate.Baremetrics shows you your MRR, Net revenue, MRR growth rate, quick ratio, and more. Look at the dashboard: It can be difficult to calculate all the different types of MRR to get your NRR and GRR. That’s why you should use Baremetrics to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for SaaS companies. Baremetrics can integrate directly with payment processors, including Shopify, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, and more. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.I’m going to be very predictable here and answer the question with “both”. NRR and GRR tell you different things about your company. I often like to say that each metric you track is designed to answer a single question about your company (If you don’t believe me, look here and look here too, as I really do say it a lot).So, what questions are answered by NRR and GRR? NRR is a good indicator about whether you are keeping your customers buying more. This is usually done by continuing to build new services and upselling to your clients by getting them to add each new tool to their service package.GRR tells you how satisfied customers are with your product as well as your customer service. If your clients are satisfied, then they won’t churn and your GRR will remain close to 100%.NRR, GRR, and customer retention rate can be confusing, which is why I put together this FAQ based on questions I’ve heard before.For your SaaS business to keep growing, you should aim for an NRR above 100%. While the average SaaS business does hover around 100%, pushing for a higher rate is a good way to improve your MRR.This is because it can be easier to get customers that already love and value your service to spend more than to get new clients to sign up.An NRR that is over 100% means that your revenue increase from upsells is greater than your revenue decrease from churn. This is a good thing and is an indicator that your company is seeing revenue growth independent of new customer acquisition. GRR is always between 0% and 100%. In addition, your GRR is always at most equal to your NRR. If either of these is not true, then you have made a mistake and need to recalculate your GRR and/or NRR.The only difference between NRR and GRR is that NRR includes Expansion MRR while GRR does not. In other words, NRR includes upgrades while GRR does not.NRR, similar to the quick ratio, is a great metric for a direct view into the growth of your revenue stream. Tracking NRR over time will give you a better understanding of the stability of your income stream.Different growth metrics tell you different things about your company.The net revenue retention rate tells you how much your revenue from current customers is growing or shrinking from month to month.The gross retention rate and customer retention rate tells you how well you are keeping clients signed up for your service from month to month.Since a business is a complex entity operating in a dynamic world, you need to track many metrics to have a clear picture of your company’s financial health.That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with Shopify, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "What Is Bundle Pricing?.\n",
      "Bundle pricing is one of the many pricing strategies employed by companies in an attempt to increase their revenue and/or profit.In bundle pricing, a company collects many products and/or services together and sells them as a single item for a single price. The classic example of bundle pricing is the McDonald’s Happy Meal. While the components have changed a lot over the years, instead of buying a drink, side, and main course separately, they are offered together at a lower price.The lower price is one of the key components. Often one of the items has a much higher margin but is also less desired by the consumer, so offering a discount on the bundle allows the company to increase the average profit per transaction while satisfying the customer with a greater perceived value. To go back to the Happy Meal, it might be that the fountain drink is nearly all profit and easily substituted by the customer for a free cup of water, so offering the Happy Meal for more than the price of the fries and hamburger but less than that of the fries, hamburger, and Coke, it entices the customer to buy that less needed drink component, thus increasing the profit substantially.As we will see in this article, bundle pricing is a particularly powerful strategy in the SaaS market where the average SaaS enterprise has multiple software modules available on their platform.Whatever pricing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data, including your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Integrating this innovative tool can make evaluating your pricing strategy seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.Bundle pricing can be found in every industry. The following are some examples of bundle pricing commonly found:Meal sets at fast food restaurantsMicrosoft OfficeSmartphone and accessories sold togetherFree dress shirt and tie with purchase of a suitThe examples show the value of bundle pricing to both parties. The seller gets to increase the average price of their transaction (sometimes referred to as ARPU (average revenue per user) in SaaS), move lower-volume goods, and improve their volume. The buyer gets increased value, an easier purchase decision, and less hassle from shopping around.The bundle pricing strategy is best for businesses that have some or all of the following features: One major product or service with many smaller products or services that make the main one more valuable to the customerThe average revenue per user (ARPU) is more important than the average revenue per product or serviceExtremely low marginal cost (usually very low variable costs but high fixed costs) Many SaaS enterprises exhibit all of these characteristics. Often the majority of expenses are incurred while developing a platform, while the cost to add another user is nil or close to. Because of the high customer acquisition costs (CAC), most SaaS businesses care more about the customer lifetime value (LTV) than the price of their products, although they are clearly related. Finally, many SaaS enterprises have a main platform, while all of the other services are mere add-ons. Especially if the main platform isn’t particularly useful without the add-ons, you should consider a bundle pricing strategy so each user gets the maximum value out of the service.  Bundle pricing can be broken down into two types: pure bundling and mixed bundling. Pure bundling can be further broken down into joint bundling and leader bundling.  Pure bundling is when the customer can only purchase the bundle—each individual product within the bundle is not offered for purchase separately. In this case, the customer is left with a much simpler buy/don’t buy decision.Within pure bundling, joint bundling and leader bundling are differentiated based on the relative value of the products within the bundle.In joint bundling, each product is generally seen as having equivalent value. If you go to a taco truck and buy three different types of tacos, while one might end up being your favorite, the bundle can be seen as made of equals. In leader bundling, there is a product which clearly has a higher value than all of the other products. The example of the smartphone falls into this category. You buy an expensive iPhone and get a couple of much cheaper accessories for free to “sweeten the pot.”Mixed bundling is when you give customers the option to buy each product separately for a price that generally totals more than all of the individual items sold together. This is usually seen in restaurants, but some SaaS companies do the same.Even Microsoft allows you to buy individual programs within the Office suite separately if so desired.The steps to successfully using bundle pricing are fairly simple in concept but may take a lot of brainstorming to successfully do in practice. First, understand what your customers are looking for. This is how you market your bundle to them. In this case, the goal is to represent the bundle with the desirable products or services at the front.Second, your bundle should have a main, high-value component as a centerpiece. This is the focus of the sales pitch and makes it easy for the customer to see the value of the bundle.Third, fill out the bundle with accessories that give the impression that the centerpiece is even more valuable—or, better yet, becomes more valuable because of the accessories.Finally, use the bundle to improve your margin. Find items that have a high perceived value (and therefore price) but low cost to produce to ramp up the perceived savings of the bundle while still improving the amount you are earning per customer.If you’re looking for a smarter way to measure the effect of a new pricing strategy, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Have a look at the demo to see how Baremetrics can show you the results of your marketing decisions.Bundle pricing has its pros and cons. By understanding these advantages and disadvantages, you can take full benefit of the upside bundle pricing offers while avoiding the potential pitfalls.Bundle pricing offers clear advantages to both the provider and the customer. Let’s take a look at some of them.Often times the true value of a product isn’t clear to the customer until they purchase all of the accessories and add-ons. In a subscription revenue model, it is possible that, instead of paying for all of these functions, the customer will churn because they do not understand the value you are bringing.By offering a bundle of all of your services, the customer can unlock the entire platform and appreciate the value you can bring them. In doing so, they are more likely to extract value from your service and stick with you for the long run.When faced with too many options, especially when those options seem to be very similar, people are overcome with “analysis paralysis” or an inability to make a decision. This makes the shopping experience worse for your customer while robbing you of sales. Offering a single bundle, or two to three tiers only, the decision is made manageable.When bundle pricing is done right, the average size of each sale jumps. When it is done superbly, the number of sales also goes up. The combination can greatly improve your revenue numbers.If you have a product or service that doesn’t seem popular with potential clients but you know it adds value to your main product or service, bundling them can increase the volume of the less popular product while increasing the total perceived value to customers. Bundle pricing can be a great way to improve your revenue results, but it isn’t without its disadvantages. While it should be clear that, especially for a SaaS business that gets its income from subscription revenue, bundle pricing is a great option, let’s look at the downsides briefly to understand them. Some customers only want a specific product you offer. Others do not like to feel bullied into buying products they aren’t looking for. In both cases, they may not like the implication of being forced to buy other products or services as part of a bundle. While you may know that all your secondary services really make the main service better, your customers might not need all of that extra functionality. In that case, they may decide to keep looking for simpler (or cheaper) alternatives. Bundle pricing is a natural option for SaaS business. By bundling many services together, you can improve your ARPU and LTV, while adding value to your offerings. If done correctly, this will lead to more loyalty among your client base. Baremetrics is the obvious choice for SaaS businesses seeking to better track their revenue while making major pricing strategy changes.If you’re looking for a smarter way to approach your SaaS business’s revenue performance, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Marketing channels are only as good as their results.

      "How to Calculate the Quick Ratio for Shopify Partner Apps.\n",
      "The Shopify Partner community has helped Shopify build the premiere ecommerce ecosystem. Shopify Partner Apps are bringing great value to Shopify shop owners. To maximize the value of your Shopify Partner Apps, you need metrics, and one of the most comprehensive growth metrics is the SaaS quick ratio. We’ll call it the quick ratio for simplicity here, but don’t confuse it with the accounting quick ratio.In the simplest terms, the quick ratio tells you how your app is growing. It is essentially the sum of all the good monthly recurring revenue (MRR) types divided by the total of all the bad MRR types.As we will see below, the quick ratio isn’t easy to calculate by hand because it requires a lot of data that might not be provided in a neat format.This complication can only increase when your customers tend to change pricing tiers, purchase add-ons, or you implement usage-based pricing.Thankfully, when it comes to calculating the quick ratio for Shopify Partner Apps, along with all of the related metrics, Baremetrics excels. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, ARPU, churn, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with Shopify, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.The quick ratio is a benchmarking metric that allows you to see at a glance whether your app’s growth is sustainable. Compare the value of your quick ratio to a chart, and you know immediately whether you're contracting, stagnating, or seeing healthy growth.Absolutely. The quick ratio, perhaps only second to the LTV to CAC ratio, is among the most important pieces of information you can have for decision making.Again, the answer is yes. Understanding the math behind the quick ratio can make the information provided by the quick ratio for Shopify Partner Apps more actionable. If you don’t understand the components, then it is harder to pick the low hanging fruit to improve your quick ratio.While you should understand the quick ratio and how to calculate it so that you can take action, there’s no need to calculate it independently every time. Baremetrics shows you your quick ratio clearly on your dashboard.Look at your quick ratio here:The quick ratio includes all the different types of MRR. While MRR is simply the amount of subscription revenue your app is bringing in monthly, the different components show where MRR is coming from or how it is leaving. Let’s look at the different pieces of MRR.To fully understand the quick ratio, you need to understand MRR and all the components that affect its movement from month to month.MRR is the amount of money you are bringing in through subscriptions in the average month. Some things increase your MRR (e.g., new customers and upgrades) and others decrease MRR (e.g., churn and downgrades).Let’s look all of these MRR components:New MRR is the additional MRR from new customers.Expansion MRR is the additional MRR from existing customers (also known as “upgrade MRR”).Churned MRR is the MRR lost from cancellations.Reactivation MRR is the additional MRR from churned customers who have reactivated their account.Contraction MRR is the MRR lost from existing customers due to downgrades.The math that goes into the quick ratio isn’t complicated. Let’s take a look at the equation:On the one side, you sum up all the positive influences on your MRR from new customers (new MRR), customers upgrading their plan (expansion MRR), and customers who previously churned and now are coming back (reactivation MRR).On the other side, you sum up all the negative influences on your MRR from customers downgrading their plan (contraction MRR) or leaving your app (churned MRR).Finally, you divide the positive influences by the negative ones to get your quick ratio. This might sound simple when you are starting out and have a handful of customers, but imagine doing this for thousands of users, each rotating through plans, joining or quitting in any given month, paying annually or monthly, and using different coupon codes or referral discounts.It can be difficult to calculate all the different types of MRR to get your quick ratio for Shopify Partner Apps. That’s why you should use Baremetrics to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for Shopify Partners. Baremetrics can integrate directly with Shopify and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard. Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, and more. Best of all, it can calculate your quick ratio automatically!Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.The quick ratio at a glance gives you a great deal of information. While there is no perfect quick ratio number, so long as your company can handle the growth, bigger is better.However, ridiculously high quick ratios can put you at risk of, counterintuitively, being a failure due to success. If your customer service falters, you become less responsive, or your platform can’t handle the influx of data, a too large quick ratio could lead to dissatisfaction.The SaaS world is competitive, and some negative reviews can quickly scare away would-be customers.Keeping all that in mind, a quick ratio under 1 is an indication that your MRR is actually decreasing, which should set off alarm bells. A ratio of between 1 and 4 is an indication of slow growth. Depending on your current MRR, the goals you have for your company, and the niche you occupy, this might be fine. However, it can often be an indication that your churn is too high or you aren’t seeing consistent growth from your sales and marketing campaigns.A quick ratio above 4, again provided you have the capacity to handle it, is usually a sign of long-term, sustainable growth.The quick ratio for Shopify Partner Apps has a very different set of benchmarks. The market is highly competitive and more reliant on five-star reviews. That means you can both expect lower growth and probably need to grow more slowly to maintain the responsive customer service users expect from expensive apps that directly affect their livelihood. That’s why the quick ratio for your Shopify Partner App can hit as low as 0.9 before you should be really concerned. A range of 0.9 to 1.1 is showing stagnant growth. Some weeks you are up and others you are down. This is a good place to ramp up experiments and overhaul everything from your dunning process to your pricing.If you can hit a quick ratio of at least 1.4, then you can be confident that your app is growing steadily. This is a sustainable growth trajectory where you can be confident that your app will keep rising in the Shopify Partner App Store.The quick ratio gives you the helicopter view of your company’s growth. With a single number you can see if things are going well or you need to make a change.Improving the quick ratio of your Shopify Partner Apps requires looking at the MRR components and choosing which ones need your attention.A high churn MRR means you should focus on reducing voluntary churn and eliminating involuntary churn.An imbalance between contraction and expansion MRR could be an issue with your pricing tiers.A low new MRR can be fixed by better inbound marketing and a better lead conversion ratio.That’s why you should use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, etc. Baremetrics does all of this for you, and more.Baremetrics can even monitor your quick ratio. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.\n"

      "How to calculate CAC for Shopify Partner Apps.\n",
      "Much like Amazon, when Shopify first began, it was a simple shop and not the ecommerce platform we know today. In fact, perhaps fitting for its Canadian roots, it started off as a snowboard shop! Perhaps one of the most interesting features of Shopify is the Shopify Partner system where individuals and third-party companies can sell their services or apps, in the so-called micro-SaaS space.While industrious developers have collectively put forward great effort developing apps to calculate, track, and project all manner of metrics for Shopify shop owners, where do Shopify Partners track the metrics of their app portfolio? One of the most important metrics is customer acquisition cost (CAC). CAC represents the total cost to onboard a new paying customer. It can include everything from your sales and marketing expenses per new customer to the per customer cost of running your free trial. However, calculating CAC for Shopify Partner Apps can be difficult.When it comes to calculating CAC for Shopify Partner Apps, along with all of the related metrics, Baremetrics excels. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is basically how much it costs to get a new client to sign up for your app. CAC can be calculated for all of your users to date, but it is more commonly considered over set periods, for example monthly or yearly, to see how the cost structure is changing. The basic calculation is to add up all of the expenses specifically related to acquiring new customers and then divide them by the number of new customers. However, the expenses included in CAC vary by company. Most developers will include at least advertising and marketing expenses. You could also include the associated salaries, overhead costs, creative costs, and the technical costs of running a free trial or any software used to track leads or conversions. In this case, creative costs include everything spent developing content for marketing campaigns across blogs, social media, the Shopify App Store, and so on. That content also has associated publishing and production costs that could be included too. The share of expenses you include in CAC versus ACS (average cost of service), which is the month-to-month cost of running your Shopify Partner Apps, can be a personal choice, but keep in mind that CAC is used for a lot of more advanced metrics. Therefore, if you choose to inflate/deflate your CAC by shifting costs from/to your ACS, then the target values of these advanced metrics might need to be adjusted as well.For example, the customer lifetime value (LTV), which is the total amount of revenue collected from the average customer over the duration of a contract, is often combined with CAC as the LTV to CAC ratio. An LTV to CAC ratio of 3 (i.e., you earn $3 in LTV for every $1 spent on CAC) is generally considered sustainable. However, if you fail to include the parts of overhead, technical costs, and salaries that are devoted to getting new paying customers in your CAC, then you may need a higher LTV to CAC ratio to reach sustainability. Look at the CAC formula:CAC = Money Spent Acquiring New Customers/Number of New CustomersAs can be seen, you can improve your CAC in two ways. First, you can reduce the amount you are spending on acquiring new customers while maintaining the same customer increase. Second, you can maintain your budget but acquire more paying customers. Of these situations, the second is the better indicator that your company is becoming more popular and that all the content you are releasing is doing its job.If you are looking to get even more insight into whether your growth is sustainable, take a look at our article on how to calculate the quick ratio for Shopify Partner Apps. Note that the guidance values are different from those of other SaaS businesses, so it is important to take that into consideration if you are transitioning from SaaS to micro-SaaS.Searching the Internet, you can often find posts similar to the following:Help please! I'm currently organically growing my Shopify Partner App, but I am planning to start spending money on marketing and sales. What kind of CAC can I expect?Can anyone recommend a good metrics platform?TIAThe first question is hard to answer. While 30% of the LTV is a safe number to invest as your CAC, it is likely to be much higher early on. Once you rank higher in the Shopify Partner Apps Shop and have many positive reviews, your lead conversion rate should increase and your CAC decrease.For the second question, Shopify Partner Apps have made it easy for Shopify shopkeepers to know their growth metrics. However, it can be difficult to calculate all of your needed revenue, customer, churn, and MRR movement metrics including CAC for Shopify Partner Apps. That’s why an analytics dashboard is so important to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with Shopify and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Calculating CAC for your Shopify Partner Apps can give you insight into many different decision-making processes. It gives you a reasonable understanding of how much you can afford to spend on marketing and sales to acquire new users.By looking at the expenses driving your CAC, you can figure out how to decrease it.As mentioned above, CAC is an important metric, but it needs to be combined with others to give you the most information possible. In addition to the LTV to CAC ratio, the CAC payback period is an important metric to know. The CAC payback period tells you the number of months it takes for your company to earn back what it spent on acquiring the new user.You can calculate the CAC payback period in two ways. In the first case, you simply divide the CAC by the average revenue per user (ARPU). However, this only gives you the number of months when revenue has covered your CAC and not profit. To know how long it is until your gross profit will cover your CAC, you need to either multiply ARPU by the gross margin percent (GM%) or subtract the average cost of service (ACS):CAC Payback Period = CAC/(ARPU × GM%)CAC Payback Period = CAC/(ARPU – ACS)If the CAC payback period is long, which generally means more than five to seven months but can mean up to a year if you have very high retention, then you may need to act.For example, you could need to reduce your marketing budget, refocus your pitch to find better leads, or, counterintuitively, you may need to raise prices. If you are not pricing based on how much value you bring to your customers, then you might be undercutting your profitability and adding stress through a too high CAC payback period.CAC is an important metric. It can help you with decision making throughout the company, from marketing and sales to development and customer service. For example, if you have many marketing channels, CAC can help you decide on the ones that are worth focusing on. If your LTV is dragging down your CAC to LTV ratio, then it might be time to work on your dunning.However, CAC is only part of the picture, and without LTV and a host of other metrics, it is hard to make optimal decisions. Calculating CAC for Shopify Partner Apps, along with all of these other metrics, can be difficult, so use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many users, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more.

      "What Is Marginal Profit?.\n",
      "Marginal Cost (MC) =  (Change in Costs)/(Change in Quantity)Marginal Profit (MP) = Marginal Revenue (MR) – Marginal Cost (MC)Total Profit (TP) = Total Revenue (TR) – Total Cost (TC)Average Profit = (Total Revenue – Total Cost)/Total QuantityWe now have all the tools and information needed to answer some basic questions about the example outlined above. (1) What is the total profit?First, let’s total the revenue. We sold 30 shirts at $30, which is 30 × $30 = $900. We then sold 30 more for $20 each, which 30 × $20 = $600. Finally, we sold 40 for $15, which is 40 × $15 = $600. Thus, the total revenue is $900 + $600 + $600 = $2100.Next, let’s total the expenses. There are two types of expenses here. The first is the fixed expense, which means it doesn’t change with the quantity produced. That’s the $200 machine. The next are the variable expenses, i.e. the ones that change with volume produced, which are $2 per shirt or $2 × 100 = $200 total. Thus, we have total costs of $200 + $200 = $400.Finally, total profit is the revenue minus expenses, or $2100 – $400 = $1700.(2) What is the average profit of the t-shirts?We know that the total profit is $1700 and the quantity produced is 100. Therefore, the average profit is $1700/100 = $17. (3) What is the marginal profit of the 1st, 20th, 50th, and 100th shirts?This will be easier to see in table format: \n",

In addition, we’ve recently written about why you should use Baremetrics to get the billing history of your Stripe customers.Before we jump into the benefits of combining Baremetrics with Stripe, we’ll take a quick look at what Stripe is, and the advantages of using Stripe as your payment processor.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, including Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Billing has become one of the most difficult aspects of running a business. There was a time when you could invoice with a pen paper and the customer, standing right in front of you, could simply hand you cash. However, those days are long gone. Even in person it is no longer efficient to write up complex invoices by hand. There are too many to write, and the chance of error is too great. The Internet brings further complications, where the distance between customer and supplier has grown, customers are using a hundred different currencies, and recurring payments means repeating the process every month. That’s why CRM (customer relationship management) software and online payment processors have become such an integral part of any company’s success. And in the competitive market of payment processing, there is one clear champion. Of course, this is Stripe.So, what is Stripe? Well, Stripe is a complete suite of payment products. It brings together all of the payment processes required to build websites, apps, and online stores that accept payments. Furthermore, it can send payouts globally. While Stripe’s tools were designed and implemented to power payments online, it also works for brick-and-mortar retailers (or those running both online and in-person sales channels). Stripe can also be used to run software platforms, marketplaces, and subscription businesses.  In addition, Stripe performs many of the other necessary tasks found in payment processors. For example, it can help prevent fraud through fraud checks, generate and send invoices, provide financing, and manage a business’s budget. It even offers virtual and physical corporate credit cards.When choosing your payment processor, it is important to look at all the products provided to determine whether the company meets your needs. The price, per month, transaction, and/or as a percentage of sales, is also a key point.  That’s why we have recently evaluated many of the popular payment processors on the market, including Stripe. Here, we will just mention a few of the main advantages and disadvantages of using Stripe.While the advantages are clear, Stripe does have a few downsides:This last point is why it becomes necessary to use a third-party analytics dashboard when you choose Stripe as your payment processor.  So, let’s discuss all the amazing features you can find on Baremetrics, a tool that fully integrates with Stripe and brings the data to life in a way that is easy to interpret and act on.Since your SaaS company uses a CRM and/or payment processing software, the data required to compute these core metrics can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut.  Baremetrics can do all of this for you.Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.First, let’s look at the Baremetrics dashboard. The Control Center provides you at a glance all the important information you need about your business. It automatically calculates and displays your MRR, net revenue, average revenue per user, MRR growth rate, user and revenue churn, LTV, and so much more. It also gives you a breakdown of your numbers, including your new trials, customers, expansions, and reactivations. Finally, it gives you a live feed of all the money coming in.Unlike the Stripe analytics dashboard, Baremetric’s People Insights allows you to segment your customers into super fine detail. You can separate customers across multiple different characteristics simultaneously. Dunning is such an important part of any subscription revenue company. When you are earning money through recurring revenue, keeping your customers happy month on month is the only route to profitability. While churn due to dissatisfaction is frustrating and needs to be addressed, there is nothing more upsetting than losing happy customers due to credit card issues. Recover can help you keep your happy customers signed up. It provides a suite of tools, from dunning emails to in-app reminders and paywalls, to recover your failed payments. Baremetrics is so confident in its Recover tool that the first $1000 in recovered payments is free.A pair of tools, Trial Insights and Cancellation Insights, helps you refine your funnel process and platform to get more potential clients to convert to paying customers on the one side and keep them active on the other.Free trials are a great way to onboard new customers (we use it at Baremetrics), but not all free trials are designed the same. Determining how long you should allow potential customers to use your platform is one element that can be refined. If your platform requires two months to show its value, then a seven-day trial is probably not going to be enough time for a customer to understand the indispensability of your service. Conversely, if your trial is too long, then it might incentivize customers to cheat through using multiple email accounts to keep using your platform for free.There are also decisions to be made around whether you should require a credit card number to access the free trial, whether the free trial should include the whole site, and, importantly, how you should focus your free trial period marketing campaign. Indeed, a good set of emails that points customers to your best features, teaches them how to use them, and gets them to integrate your platform into their daily work processes during the free trial will help you hook those leads. Figuring out how your trials are working with Baremetrics will help you refine this process. Conversely, getting customers to tell you why they are leaving with Cancellation Insights will help you refine and improve your platform to both prevent further cancellations and win-back your lost customers in the future. While there isn’t space to mention every great feature Baremetrics has in one article, it would be incomplete without mentioning Forecasting. The Stripe analytics dashboard is sorely lacking in forecasting ability, and this is something that every company must do to be successful. The forecasting alone is reason enough to add a third-party Stripe analytics dashboard to your software repertoire. Finally, in researching this article, we went through dozens of “best Stripe analytics dashboards” lists online. While we are happy to see that all of the independent raters and our competitors agree that we are among the best, there is an error found on every single list that must be corrected. Baremetrics does not cost money for young companies! We aren’t sure where this misconception originated, but Baremetrics is COMPLETELY FREE until you reach an MRR of $5000!Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.\n"

      "UXPin Uses Baremetrics to Track SaaS Metrics and Financial Growth.\n",
      "Challenge: UXPin needed a tool to consolidate their subscription data and track metrics. Solution: They signed up for Baremetrics. Right away, its toolkit replaced their in-house solution and made it easy to track metrics and segment customers. Result: Baremetrics has saved the UXPin team more than 50 hours of maintenance on the in-house tool. This allows their team to focus on product, sales, and growth. UXPin is a code-based design tool that simplifies and unifies product development process by bringing code components to the design stage. Its extensive platform allows teams of all sizes to collaborate and develop powerful prototypes more efficiently. UXPin offers four subscription levels to suit the design needs of companies ranging from startups to large enterprises. Industry leaders like Johnson & Johnson, PayPal, and Amazon rely on UXPin to streamline and accelerate their design processes. Baremetrics spoke to UXPin’s co-founder and CFO Marcin Kowalski to learn more about how they use Baremetrics to track financial growth, segment customers, and respond immediately to problems.UXPin was founded in Poland in 2010. At that time, they used both PayLane and PayPal to process payments. Within a few years, UXPin moved to the United States and was able to migrate Poland-based subscriber data from PayLane, but not PayPal. This was a major issue because their Poland-based PayPal customers made up a significant portion of UXPin’s revenue. Marcin and his team faced a decision. Either they maintain the Polish PayPal account and establish a separate payment processor based in the US, or make existing customers cancel and resubscribe using the new PayPal account. They decided to maintain their Polish account. After all, according to Kowalski, they anticipated a risk of losing around half of their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by asking people to manually switch. Maintaining two separate payment processors proved to be challenging, especially when it came to consolidating and analyzing the data. In order to do this, UXPin built internal tools to analyze activity based on algorithms that recognized events like expansion, contraction, and lost MRR. Like most internal tools, UXPin’s monitoring tool required ongoing maintenance. It would work for a few months, then suddenly crash, requiring Kowalski to spend days figuring out the problem. What’s more, the data took a long time to load and didn’t provide the insights they actually needed. “We were completely blind. We didn’t fully understand what was going on with our customer accounts,” says Marcin Kowalski.Eventually, UXPin’s Poland-based subscribers using PayPal either ended their subscriptions or encountered a billing issue that served as an opportunity to redirect them to the new US-based billing system on Stripe. By October 2020, 99% of UXPin’s customers were paying via Stripe. It was around this time that UXPin switched to Baremetrics. In order to get a clear picture of their financial health and support growth, UXPin needed to:Stripe is the leading payment processing service for SaaS and subscription businesses. Its platform handles recurring payments from customers all over the world, supports different pricing models, and has developer-friendly features that allow for limitless customization.Stripe’s in-app metrics feature, however, is limited to just 16 metrics. Growing SaaS & subscription companies upgrade to Baremetrics for efficient, accurate, and in-depth reporting.The UXPin team checks the Baremetrics Control Center frequently to keep a pulse on financial activity. Here they can view MRR, Net Revenue, Average Revenue Per User, MRR growth rate, and 17 other metrics- all in one place.  Below is Baremetrics’ actual control center. You can see it in real-time here!Baremetrics tracks subscription data and calculates key business metrics. Baremetrics allows UXPin to track progress towards growth goals, identify and respond immediately to issues, and feel a sense of control over their finances. And because the tool integrates with Stripe and therefore doesn’t require maintenance, the UXPin team has saved upwards of 50 hours of engineering hours on their previous reporting tool. UXPin’s sales team uses Baremetrics to segment customers based on attributes like MRR and geographic location. They can also view a customer’s entire journey with UXPin, including events like free trials, payment failure, upgrades, downgrades, and more. Here’s what the customer segmentation tool looks like when Baremetrics segments customers by geographic location, or in other words, where the active credit card on file is located: UXPin recently launched Merge, a new technology that allows users to design with code components. UXPin also launched an integration with Storybook, which simplifies the design process for design and dev teams. To learn more about UXPin, definitely check out their blog. They have a ton of resources about product development and collaborative design. UXPin is one of 900+ subscription-based companies using Baremetrics to understand key metrics and accelerate growth.

      "How to Improve Your Lead Conversion Rate for Shopify Partner Apps.\n",
      "The Shopify Partner system has created great value for developers and shop owners alike. It has been integral to Shopify’s success in developing the best online ecommerce platform. This great potential has led to huge competition in the Shopify Partner Apps Store. This makes it hard for new Shopify Partners to break into the market and established ones to maintain their market share.The lead conversion rate and the related sales KPIs are key metrics to track your market share progress. In this article, we are going to look at how you can improve your lead conversion rate for Shopify Partner Apps.Forget the tedious work of collecting data from many sources in different formats and collating it into a logical form. Baremetrics can take all of your data directly from Shopify and present 26 different metrics on a crystal-clear dashboard. Baremetrics gives you a holistic view of your expenses, profit, and forecasted MRR for specific timeframes. All this allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start getting great growth metrics automatically from your business’s transactions. The lead conversion rate can mean two different things. First, it can mean the total number of leads who become paying customers. In this article, we are dealing with the second, more common definition.Here, the lead conversion rate is simply the number of visitors to your site who eventually become leads written as a percentage. For example, if you have 1000 visitors and 100 become leads, then your lead conversion rate is 10%. Let’s look at the formula:But, what is a lead?A lead is a visitor to your page who expresses interest in your product. This means they have taken some positive action to express their desire to be contacted about your product. The most common example of expressing interest is filling out some form with their personal contact information.Finding the leads from visitors is only the first step in this process. The entire process can be broken down as follows: Some visitors become leads.Some leads become marketing qualified leads (MQLs). This is a lead who meets the general profile of your customers. Some MQLs become sales qualified leads (SQLs). These are the MQLs who have been vetted in some way. They not only meet the general framework of your ideal customer profile (ICP) but also are individually likely to convert to a paying customer.Some SQLs become customers. These are the wins.Each part of this process has its pitfalls. While in business generally “more is better”, in this case often it is how well you winnow down the different categories of leads that matters. If you can properly vet your SQLs, then you won’t waste your time dealing with leads who do not seem likely to convert to paying customers. If you properly select SQLs, then your sales team can spend three, four, or five times longer trying to convert each SQL and end up with more paid subscribers. Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is the act of modifying your funnel to push traffic towards sales and paid sign ups. Let’s look at potential issues for visitors, leads, and wins.The two major issues that you can experience with visitors are: too few visitors and not the right visitors. If you aren’t getting enough visitors, then it is likely that your Shopify Partner App isn’t getting the notoriety it deserves. This can be solved with content marketing. Just like in the Field of Dreams, “if you build it, they will come”. Content marketing just requires effort and time. You need to be producing a high quantity of content as well as a high quality of content.Doing this will eventually lead to more visitors. Keep in mind though that high quality includes picking the right keywords that are getting searches but not too difficult for you to rank on.If you are getting the wrong visitors, then you need to reevaluate your ideal customer profile (ICP). The ICP is your best description of your target market, and it will guide you to produce the content that they need and in the format they want.For example, customers on mobile devices might not want to read and therefore you may need to think about podcasting or releasing videos. These problems can be solved by more, and better targeted, inbound marketing.Lead issues come in two main flavors: too many and not enough. If you aren’t getting enough leads, that’s probably an issue with your content marketing not getting enough visitors or attracting visitors who aren’t matching the profile of your customer base. One other issue can be with how you present information and what that signals to potential users. While requiring a visitor to provide their information to see pricing details might seem like a good idea, many people find this dishonest. If you are confident that your prices are fair and competitive, then giving more details to potential users might entice them to give you real information.If you are getting too many leads, then it probably indicates a problem with your vetting process. In this case, “too many” means that you are not converting on enough leads as they do not match your ICP.Focusing your marketing and sales team on reducing the lead pool more when reporting their MQLs and SQLs can help the salespeople give more attention to the leads most likely to be customers. Conversions are more likely to happen the faster you can respond to inquiries and the more time you can dedicate to each prospective user while walking through your Shopify Partner App. Reducing wasted time on poor leads gives the sales team the time they need to nurture those best leads.If you are getting ample, good leads, and you are confident that your vetting process is giving the sales team the right leads, then why aren’t you getting more customers? If the problem is at the bottom of the funnel, where qualified opportunities become wins, then you need to look at your whole sales process:Do you have a free tier competing with the paid tiers?Is your free trial paired with good communication explaining the value added by your app?Is your sales team properly trained?Do your prices match the market?Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources, and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.KPIs are great ways to take all of your data and distill it into a single number. Each KPI can then answer a question about the health of your business. The lead conversion rate and related sales KPIs answer the following questions:Lead conversion rate: How well targeted is your content marketing?Lead-to-opportunity ratio: What is your lead quality?Opportunity-to-win ratio: What percentage of your quality leads become sales?The lead conversion rate will change over time. Ideally, you want your lead conversion rate to increase slowly over time. This is an indication that your content marketing is becoming better focused on your customer base. If your visitor count is also increasing, then a rising lead conversion rate will mean more and more leads for your marketing and sales teams to qualify. Every potential lead starts out as unqualified. A qualified lead is one that has been vetted in some way. Depending on your organization, you’ll consider your MQLs and/or SQLs as opportunities. If these opportunities are not turning into paid customers at a high rate, then you need a stricter vetting process.Assuming your qualified leads are actually of high quality, then you should be closing a reasonably high portion of them (about 15% of opportunities should become wins).If this isn’t the case, either your vetting process for leads is wrong or your sales approach needs work.The lead conversion rate is fundamental to evaluating the top of your sales funnel. If you aren’t getting enough visitors or not enough visitors are interested in your product, then you have marketing issues.If the leads are not turning into customers, then you have sales issues. This can mean you aren’t correctly vetting your leads, or your sales process needs to be reworked.While many industries are still using the same sales KPIs as they did 50 years ago, this won’t cut it in SaaS. The industry is too competitive, and the best companies are evolving rapidly. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "What Is Marginal Revenue?.\n",
      "Marginal revenue (MR) represents the increase in revenue from the sale of one additional product or service. Although marginal revenue can be constant over many units of output, the law of diminishing returns states that it will eventually decrease as the output level increases. Knowing your marginal revenue is particularly important in competitive markets because, according to economic theory, profit maximization results from continuing to produce more units of output until marginal revenue equals marginal cost.In this article, we will go through the theory behind marginal revenue, explain why it is important for production decisions, compare it to some similar metrics, and discuss the analysis of marginal revenue.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.While marginal revenue in an economics classroom is usually considered the amount of added revenue gained by selling one more unit of production, in practice this isn’t reasonable because firms are rarely in the position to sell a single extra item. Instead, marginal revenue is usually thought of as the total change in revenue divided by the total change in output. An example of the classroom version is as follows: a SaaS enterprise sells 100 subscriptions for $1000. They then sell their 101st subscription for $7. Therefore, their marginal revenue is $7.An example of the more realistic latter situation is as follows: a SaaS enterprise sells 100 subscriptions for $1000. They then start a 30% discount pricing campaign and sell 50 more subscriptions for $350 total. Since 350/50 = 7, the marginal revenue of the discounted batch of service agreements is $7.Marginal revenue only regards the most recent unit or set of units. Conversely, average revenue is the average revenue earned per item. In the second case, the average revenue would be ($1000 + $350)/(100 + 50) = $9. In this case, the marginal revenue is less than the average revenue. However, this depends on the pricing scheme chosen. For example, a price skimming system would have a lower marginal revenue, whereas a penetration pricing system would have a higher marginal revenue than average revenue. Let’s formalize the examples above with an equation. Marginal revenue measures the change in revenue earned with a change in quantity sold. This can be expressed as follows:Marginal Revenue = Change in Total Revenue/Change in Total QuantityIf you are comfortable with calculus, you can consider marginal revenue the first derivative of the total revenue function with respect to the quantity, but for all practical purposes you can leave the calculus at home and use simple arithmetic. In a competitive market, the price is set where the supply and demand curves meet. When the supply is increased, the new intersection with the demand curve is lower, which means the price decreases. For example, based on your market research and understanding your customers’ willingness to pay, you are confident that you can sell 20 new subscriptions per month at $20 each, but you could sell 30 at $15 each. In this case, the marginal revenue of the 30th item would be $15, which is lower than the 20th item at $20. For this reason, unless the demand also changes, the marginal revenue tends to decrease with the increase in quantity. We can see this graphically below:In this situation, the marginal profit is zero, but the total profit is not. In fact, the total profit is maximized, which is somewhat counterintuitive. Remember that these are the marginal revenue and the marginal cost. Since the marginal revenue is either flat or decreasing over time while the marginal cost is increasing in the part of the U-shaped curve where it meets the marginal revenue curve, each previous unit has produced some marginal profit (as MR > MC). Thus, producing until the last unit generates no profit or no loss maximizes the units that have been sold at profit.In practice, there is no solid equilibrium point, but rather a dynamic equilibrium as different firms compete and customers change their buying behaviors as a result. For example, the marginal revenue could increase over time because the consumer demand has increased, which pushes the price up. Conversely, the marginal costs could decrease because of hiring a new, more efficient production manager, which would mean that more units can be produced before the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves meet.This can be confusing to read and more confusing to understand, especially with the intricacies of the SaaS subscription revenue model, where the expenses and revenue are considered differently. Thankfully, you don’t need to do this alone.If you’re still using spreadsheets and basic dashboards to monitor and manage your revenue, you’re not only operating inefficiently, but you’re also probably leaving money on the table.Baremetrics’ advanced analytics and reporting tools offer an affordable, fast, and flexible means to ensure you stay on top of and optimize your SaaS business’s cash flow.Our platform does all the heavy lifting for you, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. A crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your expenses, profit, and forecasted revenue for specific timeframes. All this allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.If your marginal revenue is falling, especially without a drastic change to the quantity produced, then you should take the time to do some market research and figure out why. It could be that your competitors are initiating a price war by drastically undercutting your prices, or you may have sold subscriptions to all the easy targets and now need to think about a marketing scheme to bring new eyes to your website. If the market is feeling more competitive, then you might need to figure out a way to differentiate yourself. It could be a good time to increase your R&D budget to add new features to your platform, or simply updating the UI to match the newest aesthetics might be enough to appeal to a new generation of potential customers. If you have increased the quantity produced and that is leading to a reduced marginal revenue, consider the benefit of that increased userbase. It may be that having fewer customers paying more is a better pricing strategy.Depending on the source, marginal revenue and marginal benefit can be used interchangeably. However, they are not the same thing. Marginal revenue is the incremental increase in revenue from an extra unit of production. Marginal benefit is the added utility of the consumer base from purchasing one more unit of production. There is usually decreasing utility (economist-speak for joy, benefit, or “goodness”) from consumption, which means that every item adds a little less joy than the previous one. For example, if you head to an all-you-can-eat buffet, you pay to eat as much as you’d like. However, that third slice of chocolate cake is not going to add as much happiness as the first. You could say there is greater marginal benefit to eating the first slice of cake than eating the third slice of cake.Marginal analysis is the investigation of the additional benefits of a unit of activity compared to its additional costs. This is a form of cost–benefit analysis. Marginal analysis relies on the study of marginal costs, marginal revenue, and marginal profit to keep a company focused on incrementally improving its position. While most other forms of financial analysis take a macro view of the company or the market in which it operates, marginal analysis is a microscopic inspection of how the marginal costs and marginal revenue are changing as the quantity and/or price are changed.Marginal revenue along with marginal cost can help you understand how to price your product as well as how much to produce. However, these are just some of the many metrics needed by a modern SaaS enterprise to thrive in the competitive, global software market.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard.

      "What Is a Profit and Loss Statement?.\n",
      "The profit and loss statement is one of the three main financial statements a public company must release annually along with the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet. The profit and loss statement goes by many names, including the statement of profit and loss, statement of operations, statement of financial results or income, earnings statement, expenses statement, and, most commonly in North America, the income statement. It is also commonly abbreviated to P&L.The profit and loss statement details the revenue, expenses, and any profit or loss (hence the name) during a specified period of time, usually monthly, quarterly, or annually. There are many ways to draft the profit and loss statement depending on the detail desired and the complexity of the business. Generating these financial statements is one of the main jobs for your accountant, along with basic bookkeeping and financial projections.Once you have your books in order and are comfortable with day-to-day bookkeeping, you can unlock the full potential of the information in those spreadsheets through data visualization. Finding hidden patterns in your sales, seeing the growth potential, and knowing which service is poised to be the star of your marketplace can all be done through using Baremetrics. Data collecting and collating are only the first steps, with data analytics being a necessary next stage to maximize sales and keep on top of those past due accounts receivable.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start getting great metrics on your business’s transactions. While not every profit and loss statement is formatted the same, and the level of detail varies widely from small enterprises to international conglomerates, they all have the same basic structure. From top to bottom, the profit and loss statement has the following main sections:RevenueCost of goods sold (COGS)ExpensesGross profit (or loss)Net profit (or loss)Let’s take a quick look at each of these sections, before moving on to how the profit and loss statement is affected by the accounting method used, how it differs from the other main financial statements, and what you can get out of the profit and loss statement.At the top of the profit and loss statement you can find the revenue section. Revenue includes all of the operating income of the company. This differs from non-operating income, such as interest on bank balances, which can either follow in this section or be grouped separately in a gains and losses section along with non-operating expenses, such as money paid out after a lawsuit. The section includes gross revenue, which is the total sales volume of the company. It then has all the sales deductions, for example discounts, returns, and damaged goods. Finally, you have your net revenue, which is the total amount of sales revenue after all of these deductions.After the revenue comes the cost of goods sold (COGS). This includes all of the expenses directly related to the products or services sold, for example materials and inventory. For your SaaS enterprise, this could include anything directly related to providing your platform, such as hosting fees. The cost of goods sold is separated from the other expenses so that the gross profit can be calculated. Gross profit is simply the amount left over when COGS is deducted from net revenue. The gross margin can also be calculated at this point, which is essentially the gross profit as a percentage. Gross margin is the gross profit divided by the net revenue.The non-COGS expenses come next. These can be broken down into two main groups: cash expenses and non-cash expenses. Note that non-operating expenses, such as interest and taxes, are also often separated from operating expenses for illustrative purposes as well as to calculate EBIT (earnings before income and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before income, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).Cash expenses are all the expenses that are paid for in cash. These are the ones that are intuitively understood as expenses by people unfamiliar with accounting. Cash expenses can include marketing and advertising expenses, employee salaries and benefits, interest expenses, office supplies, rent, interest expenses, payments to contractors, etc.Non-cash expenses come in two forms, depreciation and amortization, which are used to turn tangible and intangible assets, respectively, into expenses.Tangible assets include the things of value owned by your company that you can touch. This is anything from a laptop or desk to a building or plot of land.Conversely, intangible assets are anything of value owned by your company that you cannot touch. Intangible assets include your brand name, the relationships you have with customers as well as their signed contracts, and your platform.While the cash accounting system does not include non-cash expenses, the accrual accounting system does, and it is the accrual accounting system that most tax jurisdictions will require. This will be discussed in more detail below.At the bottom of the profit and loss statement comes the net profit (or loss), which is why it is sometimes colloquially called “the bottom line.”This is the final total after all expenses, including COGS, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and taxes, have been deducted from your net revenue. While they are not GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)-approved metrics, the net income is often shown with two other totals—EBIT and EBITDA—as having many metrics is the lifeblood of financial forecasting.Baremetrics is a monitoring tool for business metrics that serves as a dashboard for your organization.

While it might seem obvious, this is actually not a simple task. That’s because there are two different accounting systems, and the way the period in which revenue and expenses are placed differs in each system. Let’s look at the cash and accrual accounting methods.In the cash accounting method, revenue is recognized when the cash is received, whether or not the cash is received before, as, or after services are being rendered. This method is very simple, but it can lead to major swings in your revenue, expenses, and profitability. It also allows you to bury revenue in future accounting periods while frontloading major expenses. This can be hugely beneficial to your tax situation, which is why most tax authorities do not allow large and/or public companies to follow the cash accounting method. Unlike the cash accounting method, the accrual accounting method uses two specific accounting principles to decide when revenue and expenses should be recorded on the profit and loss statement: the matching principle and the revenue recognition principle. These both occur independent of when the actual cash changes hands. For this reason, accounts payable and accounts receivable need to be placed on the balance sheet.The two principles can be defined as follows: Revenue recognition principle: This principle refers to the period and manner in which a company realizes its income. A company should recognize revenue in the period in which it was earned, and not necessarily when the cash was received. In America, this is done following ASC 606.Matching principle: This principle stipulates that accountants should record all revenue and expenses in the same reporting period. This means that expenses should be matched to the revenue they generate and therefore be shifted into the period in which the revenue was earned instead of being recorded in the period they were paid for.The choice among these two accounting systems will have a bearing on when you place your revenue and expenses on the profit and loss statement.The most important part of analyzing a profit and loss statement is putting multiple periods next to each other to conduct trend analysis. This can tell you how your company is growing over time and how its efficiency is changing over time, among many other trends.There are also many useful metrics on the profit and loss statement, such as gross profit, net income, EBIT, and EBITDA, as well as many others that can be calculated from the information on the statement, such as the profit margin or return on investment.The major difference between the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement is that the balance sheet is a snapshot of a business on a specific date, while the profit and loss statement is shown for a period of time. The balance sheet deals more with the book value of the company, listing equity, assets, and liabilities. The profit and loss statement is specifically designed to show the profitability of the company. Both the statement of cash flows and profit and loss statement are shown for a period of time. Whereas the profit and loss statement deals with profitability, the statement of cash flows is only concerned with the flow of money into and out of the company.If you’re still using spreadsheets and basic dashboards to monitor and manage your cash flow, you’re not only operating inefficiently, but you’re also probably leaving money on the table.Baremetrics’ advanced analytics and reporting tools offer an affordable, fast, and flexible means to ensure you stay on top of and optimize your SaaS business’s cash flow.Our platform does all the heavy lifting for you, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. A crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your expenses, profit, and forecasted cash flow for specific timeframes. All this allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.\n"

      "How to Calculate MRR for Shopify Partner Apps.\n",
      "From its humble roots as an online snowboard shop based in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify has become a giant of the ecommerce industry. As of the third quarter of 2021, it has even surpassed Amazon for traffic!Perhaps its most unique feature, and a major reason it has experienced so much success, is the Shopify Partner system, where individuals and third-party companies can sell their services or apps, in the so-called micro-SaaS space. This system has brought more functionality, better usability, and top-notch customer service, all of which would have been impossible from one company working alone. These industrious developers have even developed apps to calculate, track, and project all manner of metrics for Shopify shopkeepers, in addition to apps targeted at every other need imaginable.But, where do Shopify Partners track the metrics of their app portfolio? One of the most important metrics is monthly recurring revenue (MRR). MRR is the amount of money you bring in monthly from subscriptions. On the surface it is a simple concept, but MRR jumps around a lot, and normalizing it into a fair representation of your company’s current financial health isn’t easy. This complication can only increase when your customers tend to change pricing tiers, purchase add-ons, or you implement usage-based pricing.Thankfully, when it comes to calculating MRR for Shopify Partner Apps, along with all of the related metrics, Baremetrics excels. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, ARPU, churn, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with Shopify, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.It takes a lot of effort to collect, collate, and manipulate data with formulas to present metrics. Then there is all the effort spent interpreting and tracking the metrics over time. It could lead you to ask: What’s the point? Are metrics really worth it? Metrics are there to answer simple questions about the health of your business, and you track them over time to make sure you are happy with those answers.That’s why you need to think hard about the nature of your business, its strengths and weaknesses, and where you want to focus your finite resources and then obsessively track the related metrics. For example, MRR is great alone for valuing your company, but it also helps you track your growth trajectory as part of the SaaS quick ratio. Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is how much subscription revenue your app is bringing in over a month. It is one of the core metrics of SaaS and micro-SaaS companies that use a subscription revenue model. Along with customer lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC), MRR is among the most important metrics to track for your Shopify Partners App. The first thing you’ll want to take note of is that MRR is normalized to the month following the revenue recognition principle in accounting. That means that, if you have both annual and monthly plans, then a new annual sign up will not spike your MRR as the total contract will be spread across the duration. For example, if your annual plan is $1,200, then your MRR will increase by $1,200/12 = $100 every month for 12 months and not by $1,200 in the current month.Keeping this in mind, let’s get to the math.Calculating your MRR is pretty simple on paper. You just take your total number of customers and multiply it by the average revenue per user (ARPU), which is how much your average customer pays for your app monthly.MRR = Number of Customers × ARPULet’s say you have 100 customers. The average customer pays $500 per month. Then, your MRR would be 100 × $500 = $50,000.This looks simple on paper, but your MRR can change drastically month to month, with some factors increasing and others decreasing your MRR. To give you an idea of just how complicated this can get, let’s look at the different types of MRR.If you have an ARPU of $500 and your MRR increases by $1000, what happened? At first you might think “I gained two new customers”. Well that makes sense as you gained two times the ARPU, but what if I told you that you actually gained 3 new users, while 2 users quit, 1 downgraded their service plan, and 11 more increased to a more expensive pricing tier?To understand this, you need to look at each MRR type separately:New MRR is the additional MRR from new customers.Expansion MRR is the additional MRR from existing customers (also known as an “upgrade MRR”).Churned MRR is the MRR lost from cancellations.Reactivation MRR is the additional MRR from churned customers who have reactivated their account.Contraction MRR is the MRR lost from existing customers due to downgrades.As your business grows bigger and more complicated, it becomes necessary to track all the different types of MRR and not just your net new MRR:Net New MRR = New MRR + Expansion MRR – Churned MRRIt can be difficult to calculate all of your needed revenue, customer, churn, and MRR movement metrics including all the different types of MRR for Shopify Partner Apps. That’s why you should use Baremetrics to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for Shopify Partners. Baremetrics can integrate directly with Shopify and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Here are some lessons that will help you improve the MRR of your Shopify Partner Apps.Small incremental changes can add up over time. Keep in mind the goal of improving your MRR, and work to add new tools, improve your funnel, or increase your inbound marketing. Just don’t be complacent in your success!Free trials are a great marketing tool, but you need to teach customers how to use your app and push them to integrate it into their workflows asap. Emails that point out the valuable tools in your app and how to use them are a great way to get even more free trials to convert to paying subscriptions.Customers appreciate good service. They want responses to emails, live chats, tweets, etc. as soon as possible. Be available, and make sure your dev team is ready to fix bugs when they are reported, your customer service team has the knowledge to answer questions, and your content team is producing meaningful content to keep customers reading your emails.Customers will ask for the moon, but not every requested enhancement needs to be implemented. Keep an eye on which tools are used more and how many users are asking for the same thing. Focus on the most requested and highest value-adding functionalities.We talk a lot about pricing. We also argue regularly that if anything you are not charging enough. While $1000/month can have a real sticker shock when seen in the Shopify Partners App Store, these apps can be adding 10, 100, or 1000 times that value to the customer!Don’t price based on how much it cost you to build or how much it costs to acquire customers but by how much value you are adding to their shop.MRR, net new MRR, and all of the component MRR types are critical metrics to track for every business. Seeing the drivers of your business growth as well as anything dragging growth down is necessary to maximize growth.However, MRR is only the start. Once you have all the different MRR components at your fingertips, you can start to perform the needed benchmarking with the SaaS quick ratio. Knowing how your contracts are expanding or contracting, how many customers are finding your app (and where), and how many customers are churning (and why) is mandatory to be a responsive company. Without this information, you can’t guide your developers to build the functionalities your customers want. Focusing on the tools that add the most value will help you push your users into higher pricing tiers.You need to know where customers are finding you to maximize your marketing plan.Getting a handle on why customers are churning is needed to reduce voluntary churn and eliminate involuntary churn.That’s why you should use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, etc.  Baremetrics does all of this for you, and more.Baremetrics can even monitor your SaaS quick ratio.

      "What Is Flywheel Marketing?.\n",
      "You may have already heard about the marketing funnel and are pushing your prospects from awareness to the sale. The Baremetrics New Customer dashboard is looking great, but your monthly recurring revenue rates aren’t climbing as you thought they would. Customers are unhappy and downgrading or churning.Maybe you are wondering: What single thing should I be doing differently? Well, you need to adapt your funnel, which starts with reimagining the structure as a flywheel. The concept of flywheel marketing says that transformations never happen in one fell swoop. According to this concept, your sales and marketing process resembles a giant, heavy wheel that builds momentum until a breakthrough is achieved or slows down due to customer friction.Unlike the funnel approach, the flywheel approach suggests that the sales process is never truly complete. If, at any point, there is a lack of alignment between your sales and customer success, your wheel slows down. Improving your customer experience, user-friendliness, and conversion rates speed the wheel up.When your flywheel is in motion, clients are retained and upsold, and they will eventually become the source of new business by recommending your company to others. Because it focuses on retention, this model is uniquely suited to SaaS companies that rely on repeat subscriptions. Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right. Metaphors aside, we could say that a marketing funnel focuses on attracting one-time buyers and looking for new business instead of repeat customers. Conversely, the flywheel approach looks at customer delight and retention, as well as new business. Because SaaS businesses depend on repeat business, the flywheel approach is an excellent tactic to adopt.Like the funnel, there are several stages to flywheel marketing: In the first stage of flywheel marketing, you want your non-users or evaluators to become new users of your service. You can do this in several ways, including creating a high-converting website that showcases your expertise, provides exciting case studies, and/or offers free trials and coupons.Make sure that you track your trial customers, new customers, and coupon usage in Baremetrics’ Control Center to determine how effective your campaigns are.Now that you’ve got a few new customers, you want to keep them coming back for more. This could include renewing their subscription every month, moving to a premium tier after a free trial, or upgrading their existing plan.You want your beginners to become regular, habitual users of your product and its complete application. One way of doing this is to include product tutorials, host seminars, or highlight new or overlooked features in your product suite.It’s great that customers have signed on to your products or services and that they have started using them, but that’s not the end goal. Customers should love your products and look forward to using them regularly. The best possible outcome of a sales journey is to have a group of customers that act as brand ambassadors and recommend your product to others. This step sets the stage for customer advocacy.You can help your customers fall in love with your products or services by: Now that your customers are on board, using the service, and loving every minute of it, you can keep the flywheel turning by using your happy customers as your marketers. User testimonials, reviews, referrals, and user-generated content can be potent conversion tools.Try setting up affiliate programs or incentivizing customers to review your site in exchange for discounts or promotional gifts. The flywheel model takes some time and a few shifts to get going, but it’s well worth it in the long run because it puts customers at the center of your business operation and sets the company up for consistent, long-term growth.Here are a few of the benefits of flywheel marketing adoption: Modern customers are self-informed and want to make their own purchasing decisions. The flywheel ensures that your customers’ ongoing need for support and knowledge is met by delivering new information to them at every stage of the journey, even after they’ve converted to your service.In a traditional sales model, sales and marketing development teams will occasionally ditch their leads if they aren’t ready to close when quarterly sales numbers are due. They will also spend excessive time trying to complete deals instead of nurturing cold leads or existing customers. Leads are closed and abandoned at a much higher rate if you don’t adopt a flywheel approach. Let’s face it: Modern customers expect frictionless, high-quality service every step of the way. Their relationship continues with you long after they’ve signed up, which is why neglecting a customer after they’ve closed the deal isn’t going to work.Your flywheel maintains the focus on retention and keeping customers engaged after they’ve converted, which holds your monthly recurring revenue rates stable while also increasing your opportunities for upselling. All companies have to continue innovating to keep their doors open and avoid losing customers to the competition. By focusing on the customer (new and existing), you’ll continually gain fresh insights into what customers are looking for from companies like yours. That way, you can develop new features and products based on the market needs as they crop up and become a truly agile organization. Your sales team can spend months fostering new leads, and all that effort and benefit is lost when a customer cancels. The flywheel approach focuses on the customer and uses them to drive growth by deploying them as ambassadors.Instead of viewing each customer as having a definitive start and end point, you start viewing your customers as long-term opportunities that can support your brand over time. Moving from a sales funnel to a flywheel doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s how to move to the new framework in three easy steps. You don’t have to start from scratch. Go through your existing funnel processes and programs and decide which steps you’d like to keep. Determine which core KPIs you are already tracking and whether you can apply them to the flywheel stages. Then map the strategies, platforms, and content types you already have at your disposal or could start utilizing to attract, engage and delight your prospects and customers. You should also relook at your metrics and current stats to identify the points of friction. Your Baremetrics Control Center should give you insight into churn rates, new customers, and other key metrics you will need to create your flywheel. Keep your flywheel spinning by creating customer experiences that spark joy with your customers. Add chat support, surprise them with discount vouchers or swag, and send regular shout-outs on social media.There are endless possibilities for creating next-level customer experiences. What are the bugbears that prevent your customers from upgrading or that cause them to leave? Scrutinize your inbound marketing strategy and evaluate whether you are missing content that could be used to keep your customers coming back for more. If possible, create a customer success and onboarding team that can help customers transition to long-term retention at the point of sale. Use Baremetrics’ Cancellation Insights Tool to determine why customers might leave your company and work on making improvements according to those insights.The less friction, the faster your wheel will spin. Flywheel marketing is about delivering an excellent customer experience that will retain and upsell customers across their entire lifetime. It’s a sustainable, focused approach to sales and marketing that any SaaS company can adopt.Before you can implement your flywheel, you need to understand which areas of your customer journey can be approved. Using Baremetrics will give you in-depth insight that can help you build your marketing flywheel.Marketing channels are only as good as their results.

      "What are Inbound Leads?.\n",
      "In order to grow, your SaaS business needs a solid system for finding and converting qualified leads. All of your lead generation efforts will yield two types of leads: inbound and outbound leads. This article covers the differences between these two types of leads, as well as tactics you can use to attract more. Inbound leads are prospects that initiate contact with your business through a specific marketing channel. It could be a piece of educational content on your website, social media posts, or even a direct referral from your existing customers. Inbound leads fall under three different categories depending on the intent discerned from their level of engagement. Marketing qualified leads: These have performed simple actions like website visits and completing a lead capture form in exchange for an online resource. Sales qualified leads: These are leads who show interest beyond consuming content. For instance, inquiry about pricing and package offers.Product qualified leads:  These are leads who have used your brand’s product, maybe on a free trial or a freemium offer, and have gotten more invested. Outbound leads are prospects who do not reach out to a business; instead, the business reaches out to prospects typically through a cold call, email, or even social selling.These leads probably don't even know the business; they haven't signed up for any marketing offer.Outbound lead prospecting aims to persuade leads to use a service or a product. Examples of outbound lead generation tactics include TV commercials and radio ads. Lead generation is the process of initiating customer interest to turn that interest into a sale. It means turning strangers and prospects into people who have an active interest in your company's offers.The methods of generating leads usually come from advertising or non-paid sources like organic search engine results or web referrals.The inbound lead generation methodology works by connecting with prospects by providing value as they move through different stages in the sales funnel.Before you can initiate a customer relationship, you'll need to understand who you are trying to connect with and their pain points.Keeping your buyer persona in mind, you'll create content that’s relevant to them and relates to the context of their current situation. Your prospects will have different levels of understanding on the best ways to overcome their challenges and achieve their goals. You'll need to understand their position in the buyer's journey from awareness of the problem to consideration of potential solutions and then decision-making. Your lead generation tactics will mostly use different variations of content, conversations, and offers to attract interested prospects and convert them into leads. Prospects become leads when they share their contact information with you. Sharing their contact information implies that they may want to do business with you. Whether it's B2B or B2C, inbound lead generation tactics include four factors. Lead capture: This is the process of saving information that your prospects provide you with when they convert into leads. The information may include the prospect's name and contact information and relevant details about them or their organization, for instance, business name, role, and the number of employees at the company.Lead magnets: This is a beneficial resource that motivates prospects to provide their information and become leads—for instance, gated content like an e-book. Lead qualification: This is the process of using the lead's information to predict their readiness and willingness to make a purchase. Lead qualification gauges a lead's interest, decision timeframe, budget, and authority within their organization. An example of a qualifying question could be, “What is your ideal timeline for implementation?”Lead segmentation: Grouping leads based on their information, habits, and activities (e.g., job title, the lead magnet that attracted them, all the pages they visited, and where they existed on your website).To fulfill each of these factors, consider using these reliable lead generation tactics below. Gated content is an online resource that's only available when a prospect fills out a form. Contrary to blog posts, gated content is locked. Your prospects must complete a lead capture form to access the content. This lead generation tactic is effective because it gives the prospects a valuable resource for free while attracting prospects interested in topics related to your brand or offerings. This tactic also qualifies the lead as they fill in all the form fields to download the resource. Gated content assets often include:White papersE-booksGuidesReportsCoursesWorksheetsOnline toolsAnother great way to use written content as a lead magnet is by creating an engaging newsletter that incentivizes interested prospects to connect and stay in touch with your business. This tactic keeps you top of mind with customers and allows them to receive promotions for your products and services. With personalized newsletters, you can drive prospects further down the purchase funnel. Content for your newsletter might include:New blog postsUpdates about your products or servicesSpecial offersUpcoming eventsRecommended reading from other thought leadersYou can capture inbound leads by offering prospects a free trial or freemium product. Prospects who sign up for free trials or freemium products indicate some level of interest. These prospects are checking out your value proposition or aren't ready to make a purchase. Once free trial users sign up, you can convert them into paying customers later by teasing paid features and delivering drip email campaigns that promote upgraded accounts.Lead generation tactics can be applied both online and off. Host an offline or online event to attract and serve your target market while capturing their contact information through event registration. Also, use live events as opportunities to connect with customers in real-time so that you can answer questions, respond to objections, learn about your audience, and actively guide prospects through the sales funnel. A few event options to consider are:WebinarWorkshopSeminarMeetupConferenceWith keyword research, you can target keywords at the top of the purchase funnel in multiple ways. Use those keywords on your blog post and web copy to attract your prospects and nudge them toward your lead magnets. Plan to target the terms and phrases that your prospects search for, and use what you find to: Create valuable evergreen content optimized for the target terms.Create a topic cluster blog strategy around the target keywords.Target practical terms in search engine marketing.Write guest blog posts on sites where your ideal customers subscribe.Ensure that you follow best practices for SEO to increase your chances of showing up on the first search engine result pages. Your webpage search engine visibility is proportional to the interest and traffic you'll generate from potential leads.Your marketing teams have a lot on their plates and won't always have the time and effort to dedicate to lead generation — That's precisely why they need some help. Chatbots can be incredibly helpful for lead generation. In fact, 55% of businesses that use chatbots regularly have generated high-quality leads, and 65.1% of businesses that have implemented chatbots are SaaS companies. Chatbots are great for building rapport with prospects since they are available 24/7. When implementing chatbots, ensure you set them up to match your brand personality and function as automated extensions of your marketing and sales team.While you apply these inbound lead generation tactics, the volume of leads in your sales pipeline will increase. That said, you'll need to also invest time in getting them to become customers. You'll typically need to collect all your leads in one place so that you can keep track of various metrics.When you track leads in one place, you'll monitor metrics like how many leads you got from a specific channel, the number of qualified leads so far. With these metrics, you can easily assign leads to your company representatives.A best practice in tracking leads is the use of automation workflows. There are a series of activities you'll carry out when engaging inbound leads, like adding leads to specific lists and sending follow-up emails. Automating some of these activities ensures that your engagement process is accurate and timely.  Baremetrics gives you an intuitive dashboard that lets you track inbound leads in great detail using the People Insights feature. On the dashboard, you gain clear visibility to a broad set of client metrics. Assuming one of your leads starts a free trial on your platform, the Baremetrics dashboard begins tracking and displaying the various data points. If you want to see free trials canceled this month or even customers from New Jersey, People Insights gives you all the answers. You can go deeper with Baremetics and segment your customers, bringing meaningful and comparative insights to your dashboard. You can create custom segments, categorize your customers by region, and compare revenue across different locations with the Segmentation feature. Furthermore, you can quickly see metrics like expansion and recurring  MRR or even churn rate for any customer segment, all with the Baremetrics Segmentation tool.Beyond tracking leads with Baremetrics, you can monitor essential business metrics like monthly recurring revenue, your customer attrition rate, and even the cost of acquiring new customers. Baremetrics lets you dig deep into the details of what's driving growth and also compare business performance with previous months. You can also make well-informed forecasts about hiring, expansion, and accurate budgeting.

      "Should your SaaS Business Invest More in Content Marketing?.\n",
      "Content marketing is one of the most effective methods of generating brand awareness and brand preference specifically among your ideal target audience.The purpose of this marketing strategy is to attract organic traffic to your domain, and establish your business as a trusted authority in that area. Once users are in a position to invest in such a service, your SaaS should be the first that comes to mind.Quality content is also the key to organically climbing the search engine ladder.Anyone who searches for keywords related to your field should immediately come across your service. As a start up in a competitive industry, coming up as the 11th search result might sound impressive, but it won’t do you much good – when’s the last time you’ve clicked through to the 2nd page of a search, whether it’s for a query, a one-off purchase, or a service?A secondary benefit of this strategy is that the scope of your content can extend beyond what your services directly offer. In other words, the keywords on your content pages will cast a wide net, and attract many different types of audiences, even outside of those users who have found your domain by searching for a particular service. This wide net will primarily grow your web traffic, not sales – but that in itself is an important step in moving up the SEO ranks.Building an organic audience through content marketing is also one of the most cost efficient marketing strategies available to SaaS start-ups that can’t afford to invest in expensive ad placements.Good content marketing is different for every business, however.For some companies, adopting a bare bones approach that perfectly optimizes a single landing page is the most effective strategy.For other businesses, an expansive blog-style platform reaps the full benefits that content marketing has to offer.Take Baremetrics for instance. We’ve taken the approach of sharing every piece of our journey, so it may help other SaaS businesses out there take their first big leaps, and that’s worked very well! So, how can better content marketing help YOU?If you’re asking yourself how much time, energy, and finances you should be investing into developing your content, look no further. This guide will take you through the ins and outs of what kind of content works best for different types of businesses, and provide some handy ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ to make the most of your platform.By the way, for a complete step-by-step course on content marketing, take a look at our guide on marketing success, and our glossary of key content marketing concepts.Whatever marketing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Your SaaS company likely uses a CRM and/or payment processing software, and the data required to compute these core metrics can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut.Here too, Baremetrics can do all this for you.Some types of businesses are more likely to find success through building an expansive, content-driven platform than others.Here are some signs that your SaaS can hit it big with content marketing:Your business is fairly niche, or doesn’t have a lot of direct competitionYour competition’s SEO is fairly weak – lacks skill or fundingYou or your staff are skilled at writing quality content, and have the human resources to consistently put out articles on a regular basisYour niche is well-suited towards content creation – you can easily incorporate popular search terms and keywords in your articles that remain relevant to your core businessYou can contribute new ideas and perspectives to the existing dialogue on various topicsYour ICPs are interested in reading about topics related to your businessThe service you provide is broad enough to support on-going, relevant content creationOn the other hand, here are some indicators that you might be better off sticking to bare bones content optimization, and put your resources towards different types of marketing strategies:Your business has a lot of direct competitorsYour market corner is already saturated with SE optimized contentMost of the keywords relevant to your business are low-volume, in other words, areas where you can sensibly create content are not being searched for oftenYour team’s pool of skills doesn’t extend to content writing, or you’re already up to your eyeballs in the countless other areas of SaaS management vying for your attentionOf course, this isn’t to say that if your business displays the latter traits, you absolutely shouldn’t build a content-driven platform. This is simply to suggest that if you were to embark on such an endeavor, expect to allocate a lot of resources before seeing any real returns.So, let’s say you’ve decided to throw your hat in the ring to create some high quality content. Great!

About 5 repetitions per article is plenty to attract traffic, and vastly more will only raise search engine eyebrows and might even penalize your SEO rankingIf you have content overlap between different pages (for instance if you’re creating localized pages for the US, Canadian, and Australian markets), make sure that more than 80% of each article is unique, and that the new content is raised to the top of articles, with boilerplate information pushed to the bottomWhen major SEO regulation changes or algorithm updates are brought into effect, re-optimize your most visited pages so you stay on top of the search engine resultsDon’t over-optimize anchor texts, as this will be marked as suspicious by Google’s detection toolsFind possible topics using Google Search’s autocomplete and ‘people also ask’ featuresSource further topic ideas by asking your current customers and prospects what they’re interested inCross-post article snippets on your other platforms and send notifications to garner attention when you release a new articleIf you want to go more in depth into search optimization, this guide takes you through every step of the sales funnel with growth-focused SEO in mind.If you have a website, you have content.

      "Backlinks and Google Penalties: 5 Tips on Avoiding Search Engine Disasters.\n",
      "You’ve probably heard that backlinks are a key component of successful content marketing.Used correctly, backlinks are an invaluable tool: they generate organic traffic to your website, foster important connections within your community, and ultimately help you hit your SEO growth targets semi-autonomously.Used incorrectly, however, incoming links to your website can land your business in some extremely hot water. Beware the risks of falling into the deep cracks of algorithm holes, or committing SEO violations that will have the Google police slap you with growth-stunting rank penalties.Let’s back up a minute. What exactly are backlinks?Backlinks, otherwise known as incoming or inbound links, are created when one website links to another. The destination website is the one with the backlink.Here’s a demonstration provided by the backlink-building software Backlinko.(That clickable URL? That’s now created a backlink for Backlinko’s page on – you guessed it – backlinks. So meta.)So, want to learn how to build some backlinks that will boost your growth without landing on the SEO naughty step?Read on for our 5 tips on creating inbound links for SaaS business.Whatever marketing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Your SaaS company likely uses a CRM and/or payment processing software, and the data required to compute these core metrics can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut. Here too, Baremetrics can do all this for you.Backlinks are a tool best used in conjunction with other growth optimizers. They’re a useful content marketing component, but by no means should be relied on exclusively, especially in SaaS businesses. This is because they are unpredictable, don’t have a guaranteed ROI, and can cause more harm than good in some cases.That said, when applied properly, inbound links are very good at one thing in particular: breaking a content marketing plateau.Let’s say you’ve tweaked your content to the final degree. After extensive A/B testing, you’re confident that the following elements are the best they can be in terms of wording, layout, and use of graphics:Landing pageKeywordsSnippet Sales funnelContent quality and originalityContent length and volumeMeta descriptionsPricing pageSchema markupSite mapDespite that, you’re still caught on the 2nd page or beyond of search engines.There are a number of possible reasons for this. The most common is that the SEO of your competition simply is better or has more resources invested into it, that you’ve reached the end of your natural audience, or, in some cases, have been rank penalized (more on that under Tip 4).Excluding rank penalization for the minute, the other two scenarios are outside of your immediate control.Backlinks are the fastest way out of this rut.Essentially, incoming links enable you to access the audiences of the platforms that have linked to your website. Some of their traffic will be directed from that platform’s domain onto yours. Next time that audience needs to look something up, hopefully your content will now be one of sources users turn to intuitively.Referencing your service also implies the direct endorsement from the platform that linked to you. If the source website is well known and of good repute, this is extremely valuable not simply in terms of directing traffic to your content, but also encourages their audiences to trust in the value of your services, too. When those users are in the market for a service like the one you provide, hopefully your SaaS will be the first that comes to mind.You can also use backlinks internally within your own website. Cross-linking pages can be an effective method of pinballing traffic between different content pages, increasing overall time spent on your domain, and lowering your bounce rate. Just make sure that these links help the flow of your sales funnel, and don’t distract from the content quality of each page. If in doubt, A/B test user behavior on your domain with and without links.Backlinks can be organic, paid, or incentivized in some other way.Let’s get this out of the way. Don’t pay for backlinks. Paid backlinks are considered an unfair SEO manipulation, and violate the terms of usage for most search providers, notably Google’s.This is a fairly recent change, so don’t be fooled by outdated information – Google’s detection system for SE manipulation is unparalleled.What about incentivized links?What we’re referring to is a backlink trade – you make a deal with another website to link to theirs, if they link back to yours. No, this won’t open a portal of infinite mirrors on the internet, you’ll be delighted to know. It does, however, run some of the same penalization risks as paid links, if the context of those links is deemed unnatural.Make sure that any links to other websites that you include on your domain are congruous with the content of those pages, as unnatural outbounds can flag your for potential rule-bending just as easily as unnatural inbounds – even if the links are one-sided, Google’s detection tools will likely interpret this as a backlink trade or assume monetary compensation has taken place.The gold standard of backlinks is, of course, the organic variety. Here are some ways to naturally attract organic backlinks:Create high quality and original content that adds to the dialogue of this topicPost consistentlyOptimize your keywordsAnnounce when you’ve posted content on other platformsEdit your first paragraph with an SEO-friendly snippet view in mindAs long as you honor the standard SEO rules, traffic should naturally be flowing to your domain. A little patience is of course required, as building up a platform with quality content takes time, as does being noticed.Organic doesn’t have to mean passively sitting and waiting to be noticed, however.Look up compatible (not competing!) service providers, reviewers, and content creators in your community, and ask them if they’d like to feature your SaaS on their page. Note that the end goal is to direct visitors to your domain. Content that encourages users to click through to your website, rather than have them read about your SaaS on the other website’s domain, is far more valuable.Backlinks have two concrete goals: driving traffic to your domain, and increasing sales.The best way to determine whether your backlinks are effective is to monitor influxes in your web traffic by source, and cross-reference these patterns with changes in your search engine ranking.This process should help you figure out which sites provide the most valuable links, according to these criteria:Most clicks to your websiteMost sales conversionsIf geography is a significant metric for your SaaS, you can segment these results further by changing your search location, so you can view your ranking according to different user locations. You can do this with a VPN service, or alternatively, some search engines allow you to set this manually.Something to look out for is that not all audiences bring equal value. While a link from a popular content creator’s blog could drive hundreds of visitors to your page per week, this might result only in a 1% sales increase. On the other hand, a highly specialized review website might only increase traffic by a few dozen clicks a week, but boost sales by 30%.Backlinks that directly impact sales have a clear ROI ratio, which is useful in determining how many resources to allocate towards building inbound links.Traffic-building backlinks are invaluable in their own right, as an increase in page visits (notably low bounce-rate page visits) will push up your SEO ranking. In turn, prospects can find you more easily, so backlinks that primarily increase traffic will eventually translate into higher sales, too.Google’s Search Quality Evaluator is the holy text of SEO.These guidelines are always subject to change, so make sure you’re staying on top of the rules to avoid running afoul of any of the tenets.Here are some of the bad SEO practices that can earn your domain a red card:Backlinks that are deemed unnatural or spammy (Google’s sleuthing skills for unnatural and paid links are uncanny)Use of backlinking software (these commonly trigger the ‘unnatural link’ penalty)Backlinks from websites in a different languageSo what happens if you’re in SEO jail?The good news is, you can (usually) reverse the effects of a penalty completely. The bad news is, it’s probably going to take a while.A penalty will essentially push you down in the search results, or take you off the search index entirely.Here’s the best course of action:Perform a full SEO audit (you can hire an external service to do this for you)Locate problems by isolating drops in traffic by page to see if the drop is localized, or affecting your entire domainDisavow any unnatural links to your website in the Google Webmaster ToolBuild high quality, congruent links from your own siteOptional: fire or re-train your current SEO staffHire someone who knows what they’re doing – if they use the words ‘back door’ or ‘SE manipulation’ as a positive, run!If you’re experiencing a sudden drop in traffic, yet are certain that you haven’t committed any of the above inbounding faux pas, another possibility is that you’ve landed in algorithm no-man’s-land, also known as the algo-hole.This can happen naturally due to software updates in the algorithm, and is unavoidable for the most part.Run an SEO audit just in case, manually tweak your SEO to follow any new guidelines (software optimizers haven’t caught up to human sensibilities in this case), and wait. Unfortunately, these fixes will often only come into effect during the next quarterly update.If you’re looking for data-driven insights into your business strategies, try out the free trial at Baremetrics.

      "What is inbound marketing?.\n",
      "Inbound marketing is the process of getting potential clients to find your company. Since this often happens before customers are considering a purchase, it is often aimed at both getting more visitors to your site and focusing the targets to get the right visitors to your site. Both of these tasks can rely on content marketing, for example events, podcasts, blogs, and social media posts. Proper targeting of your search engine optimization (SEO) through keyword mining involves not just getting more views in Google results but also the right views. It is not enough to just get as many eyes on your site as possible (although that is nice)—you need to get those visitors with needs that your platform meets. To do this right, you’ll need to really define your ideal customer profile (ICP).Whatever marketing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more.Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Your SaaS company likely uses a CRM and/or payment processing software, and the data required to compute these core metrics can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut. Here too, Baremetrics can do all this for you.Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.Inbound marketing focuses on visibility, in contrast to outbound marketing, which focuses on finding customers. Indeed, inbound marketing is designed around developing relationships, building awareness, and generating leads. This has a few specific advantages. The first is that inbound marketing is completely organic, and therefore it is all about the quality of your marketing strategy and not the amount you spend. So long as you are putting good content out there, you will build viewership and that will further improve your site’s performance. Another major advantage is that customers do not feel like they are being sold to. This can lead to some brand loyalty when they are ready to make a purchase. It also means they might be inclined to spend more time on your site, read other blogs, and bookmark you for future references.There are three main ways that inbound marketing can be applied:Attract: Your aim here is to attract the right people to your site by providing content that is specifically interesting and useful to them. The goal is to become a trusted reference site to have them come back over and over. Engage: Next, you want to show that you both understand their business and offer value to them. You can do this by showing that you know their pain points and current needs, and that your platform provides solutions to these problems. Delight: This is where you offer your potential clients help and support so that they are happy to make a purchase. Continuing after the purchase, this is also building relationships with your clients so that they can succeed using your product. You want them to actually solve those problems they have been having. As a final point, inbound marketing can work within your funnel and flywheel, but since we’ve written extensively about that before, let’s move on to understanding attract, engage, and delight in detail.Attracting customers is a two-step process. First, you need to figure out who your customer is. The more specific and accurate you can make your ICP, the more likely it is that you are going to appear in the search engine results page (SERP) of your prospective clients.The ICP should include everything from the location and demographic of your prospective clients to their industry, the issues they are facing, and the kinds of knowledge they need to succeed in that industry. Keep in mind that having several ICPs is often more beneficial than having a very amorphic or overly broad ICP.The second step is content production. On the web, content is king. Depending on your targeted clientele, the content you produce could be photos, blogs, online events, webinars, social media posts, podcasts, YouTube videos, or any of the myriad other things people consume online. Having great content, produced with SEO in mind, and aimed at accurate ICPs is the key to attracting people—the right people—to your product.The next part of inbound marketing is to get your potential customers to engage with your product. While getting your clients to engage with your product is the goal, to succeed with inbound marketing it is better to focus on the problems your potential clients might have and how your product solves these issues.This is sometimes called solution selling, that is you verbalize the pain points of your customers’ business processes and how your product is a solution to those problems. Note, however, that this is not about deception! You do not want to trick your clients into signing up, as that will just result in refunds, churn, and bad publicity. In a subscription revenue model, there is nothing more important than relationships, and relationships are built on trust. Think of solution selling as more about selling your product through real examples and framing it within the needs of your customers.As just mentioned, the SaaS market is built on relationships. The longer you keep those relationships, the more profitable your company will be. Since customer acquisition costs (CAC) are often a third of the customer lifetime value (LTV) (or even more), it will always be cheaper to keep your current customers supported, satisfied, and happy (or delighted) than to find a replacement.To delight your customers, have your team act as advisors and experts on your platform to make sure each client is getting as much out of their subscription as possible. Surveys, educational emails, chatbots, and even responsive development that expands the most liked products and simplifies the user experience are all ways to keep your customers happy.Many customers looking for immediate help go to Twitter to send a message instead of email or picking up the phone. Keeping any eye on every possible communication channel is an important part of delighting customers.Inbound marketing can be a complex strategy. Whether you are new to marketing or coming from a more traditional company, the bootstrapping feel of an inbound marketing strategy can make it particularly difficult to understand. Breaking down the inbound marketing strategy into five simple steps can make it easier.You need to understand your customers and what they need to attract them to your site. If you don’t have a well-defined ICP, then you’ll be getting the wrong visitors to your page.Whatever type of content you produce, whether it is audio, visual, or plain blogs like this one, be sure your inbound marketing strategy provides helpful information during their entire journey. Knowing their pain points or interests today is a great start, but predicting the issues they’ll have in six months or three years will mean they keep coming back to your site. Prospective clients that frequent your page regularly are far more likely to trust you enough to give your platform a try. Similarly, current clients that are more engaged in your services and more interested in the content you are releasing are more likely to stick around and even provide helpful feedback and suggestions.While the shotgun approach guarantees that no prospective client is left hidden from your messaging, learning each social media site’s personal culture or how to write for each content delivery type requires time and effort—two finite resources in the fast-paced SaaS world. If your ICP says TikTok, LinkedIn, or Twitter is where your clients are most likely to be engaged with content creators, then taking a deep dive into that culture is going to pay off manifold.Understanding when your prospective customers are online and timing your content release to their schedule can increase the odds they see and therefore engage with your messaging. In addition, maintaining a consistent content release schedule will improve the visibility of your content overall. Make a schedule and then stick to it.You can’t evaluate your inbound marketing strategy without good metrics, and you can’t optimize it without tracking your metrics over time. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics does all the heavy lifting for you, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. The crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your revenue, expenses, and profit for a specified period. This allows you to quickly evaluate the results of your inbound marketing strategy.Baremetrics gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "The Seven R’s of Customer Retention.\n",
      "Some clients are destined to churn.This is not a failure on your part. It’s a simple reality that a proportion of customers who sign up to your SaaS should never have done so in the first place.These users tend to fall into one of the following categories:Circumstances changedMisjudged their own needsAren’t willing or able to make the changes necessary to adopt your productBusiness went bust or had to downsize expenditureIn other words, a baseline number of churns is to be expected, no matter how good your service is. Attempting to retain customers in this bucket is likely to prove temporary, costly, and unsustainable.But what happens if your churn rate is significantly higher than what your direct competitors are benchmarking? What can you do to reverse this trend?Here’s a guide on boosting your customer retention rates through the use of positive habit creating techniques.In order to boost customer retention, it’s crucial to conduct churn surveys and exit interviews on as many of these lost customers as possible, in order to determine the following:Not only will these questions help you boost overall customer retention, they will show whether you’re losing your highly valuable Ideal Customer Profiles.To recap, your ICPs are customers who bring in a high monthly recurring revenue (MRR), high lifetime value (LTV), and require low maintenance once acquired.If a significant proportion of churns fall into the ICP bucket, this could justify making some significant product adjustments in order to retain them, and attract more users like them in the future.Cultivating a loyal ICP base is the foundation of sustainable business growth, so you’ll want to do whatever it takes to locate, convert, and retain them.Developing your product so it best suits the needs of your ICPs is of course the best way to retain their business.There is, however, a second aspect to customer retention that is equally as important: setting up the use of your service as a habit.This entails making your product as accessible and essential as possible, so that its place in your users’ lives becomes as natural as their morning coffee.If you’re looking to build steady, sustainable revenue, and don’t necessarily have all the resources to put towards new customer acquisition, encouraging habitual use of your service in your existing customer base is especially important.Investors also tend to look favorably on SaaS businesses with a loyal fan base, as this often speaks more to the long term quality of a product than a sudden spike in customer acquisition.In order to cement the use of your service in the day-to-day life of your users, consider the 7 ‘’R’’s that underpin mindful behavioral change:RemindersRoutinesRestructuringRecordsRewardsRelationshipsReflectingSetting up a regular notification system is a great way to remind customers to make full use of their subscription with you.Getting the balance right for frequency, timing, length of message, platform etc is a bit of an art form. After all, you want to reach users at a time they’re likely to go on to actually engage with your product.If you’re too persistent and the reminders become annoying, on the other hand, users might opt out of notifications – or eventually even the service – entirely.It might take some experimentation to find the ideal parameters across the different user groups, and the more closely customized this is, the more resources this will take up.If you need to nail this process quickly, software like Amplitude provides great tools for A/B testing. Their digital optimization system can help determine which features are most effective at reaching your users. With this information, you know exactly what to develop in order to increase your customer retention rates.You can also push users to set their own reminders, for example in app or email form. Allowing customers to have active control over these reminders makes it much more likely that they’ll act on reminders when the notification pops up.Habit pairing is another powerful way to build usage of your service into a customer’s existing life structures.For instance, you could run a ‘coffee insights’ campaign on the dashboard. Imagine pressing a coffee-cup notification that leads to a broad overview of the business health at the start of the day. This would be presented in a simple, graphic format that is easy to understand, without the user having to necessarily be awake enough to digest the full brunt of number analytics.Essentially, this works on building a link between coffee, and dashboard insights, in the hopes that every time the user has a cup of coffee they’ll start to think about their business through your service.At the core of routines lies structure. In order to become part of your users’ routines, it’s critical that your product is structured to be as accessible as it can be.Some of the aspects this could include are:Mobile software functionality: the ability to use your service’s full features on a smartphoneQuick access to various levels of insight: the range to select options from ‘quick oversights’ all the way to ‘in-depth projections’Customizability to the individual needs of the user: the freedom to bring the most used tools to the forefront and declutter the user’s front pageThe purpose of all three elements is to reduce bad friction, as any frustration attached to using your service carries the risk of losing you that customer.Making your software highly customizable will require additional resources. This might seem like a sunk expense, however, it’s also an invaluable window into customer behavior that you will be able to use in the future for customer acquisition.Keeping well organized records is highly beneficial to both you and your users.On the one hand, tracking detailed user records (with their consent, of course!) enables you to personalize your interactions with them.On the other hand, allowing users to access their own records and view their progress inside your software encourages long term loyalty, as switching to another software would result in losing access to parts of their business’s history.Setting up a rewards system is a simple, positive way to keep users engaged.This could be almost entirely automated, such as a ‘task completion check’, or a more personalized message of support at key business milestones.Another form of reward is based on social interactions, allowing users to connect with each other to share in mutual successes.That platform could be hosted for an additional fee within another service, such as Slack or Discord. Essentially, all this requires is an access link provided to users, and allowing tracking data to be exported in formats that have cross-compatibility with the hosting software.Alternatively, consider creating a social circle within your SaaS for users to connect with each other.There are numerous modes of direct user-to-user interaction, each with their own benefits and engagement styles:Like the rewards system, the relationship bonds formed on the platform are likely to keep users active and loyal to the system longer term.An added bonus is that users are fully in charge of their own interactions, requiring little engagement (and therefore resources) on your end.Finally, think about providing users with a space to privately reflect on their business, and the role of your software within it.These could be completely private, or shareable with other team members.Here are some ideas for formats:Allowing users to make direct contributions on your SaaS platform is a great way to fuel organic engagement - and ultimately, that’s what customer retention is all about.Use these 7 R's to encourage long term, high value patterns amongst customers, and reap the benefits of a sustainable revenue stream achieved through a loyal user base.If you’re looking into insights into your business health, Baremetrics has you covered.

      "Use Baremetrics to find the billing history for Stripe Customers.\n",
      "While Stripe is indispensable for the average online business, providing many different tools, reports, and customizations that power online payment processing, when it comes to finding the billing history for Stripe customers, things are needlessly complicated. In addition, Stripe’s analytics side can be lacking the needed depth for SaaS businesses that rely on recurring revenue. That’s why Baremetrics is a great additional tool for companies looking to get all they can out of their data.In this article, we are going to go through how you can find your billing history for Stripe customers using the Stripe List API, as well as the easier way of letting Baremetrics do it all for you automatically. In addition, we will go into details of what Stripe can and cannot do, and how you can use Baremetrics to fill in the Stripe platform gaps.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Stripe is a fully integrated suite of payment products. Stripe brings together all of the payment processes required to build websites, apps, and online stores that accept payments. It can also send payouts globally. Stripe’s tools can power payments for online as well as brick-and-mortar retailers. Stripe can also be used to run software platforms, marketplaces, and subscription businesses.  Stripe also performs many of the other necessary tasks found in payment processors, including helping prevent fraud through fraud checks, generating and sending invoices, providing financing, managing a business’s budget, and it even offers virtual and physical corporate credit cards.There is no automatic way to find the billing history for Stripe customers on the Stripe platform. The only way to get this information directly on Stripe is to add some code to their List Charge API. To find your billing history for Stripe customers, add the following code to the Stripe List Charge API:curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\  -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc: \\  -d limit=3 \\This is a tedious process and requires even more coding to get the billing history for specific groups of customers, or for specific periods of time. If you are comfortable with coding, want to keep everything in one place, and do not plan to segment customers, track the billing history of your customers closely (e.g., to see your expansion MRR or contraction MRR), or focus on involuntary churn to keep control of your dunning, then this might be enough for you. However, most people running SaaS businesses appreciate how valuable data can be and are interested in getting the most actionable information possible from the raw sales data provided by Stripe. Luckily there is a better way. Baremetrics is the better way. The process for finding the billing history for Stripe customers works as follows. Step 1. Open up Baremetrics.That’s it. Baremetrics automatically connects to Stripe, exports all of your customer billing information, and provides the information in an easy-to-understand format. From customer segmentation to customer insights, Baremetrics takes the guesswork out of interpreting your Stripe customer billing history.Baremetrics automatically finds and organizes your billing history without any coding or personal input. Let’s take a brief look at all of the other information that Stripe does or does not provide, and how Baremetrics fills in those gaps too. Whatever CRM and/or payment processing software you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data. Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Since your SaaS company uses a CRM and/or payment processing software, the data required to compute these core metrics can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut.  Baremetrics can do all of this for you.Baremetrics can even monitor your SaaS quick ratio. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.Stripe provides two main financial reporting tools: Balance and Payout Reconciliation. These tools can help you make reports on your transaction history and payouts.The Stripe Balance Report gives you a CSV table with all of your transaction history as well as other custom data about those transactions. Think of it as a bank statement; it provides useful information for companies that also use their Stripe account as a bank account to make manual payments. The Stripe Balance Report can be used to reconcile your balance at the end of your accounting periods as part of your routine bookkeeping.This report is used by companies that have enabled automatic payments so that they can reconcile the transactions settled during each payout period. The Payment Reconciliation report matches each payout to the batch of payments that occurred during that payout period along with any other related transactions.While Stripe focuses more on being a top-end payment processing tool, it does provide a limited number of metrics used by SaaS enterprises. Stripe groups these metrics under the following headers: Growth, Retention, Subscriber Information, Product Information, and Collections Information.Under the Growth tab, Stripe presents your monthly recurring revenue (MRR), MRR Growth, Net Revenue, and New Subscribers for the specified period. In addition, you can find your MRR per product and/or per plan, if these are relevant to your revenue model.Note, however, that Stripe might include trial users in your MRR calculation, which would inflate the value. In the Retention section, Stripe shows your subscriber churn rate, churned revenue, subscriber retention, and revenue retention by cohort.The Subscriber Information category allows you to view your average revenue per subscriber (ARPS, also called average revenue per user or ARPU), customer lifetime value (LTV), your top subscribers, and any recently churned subscribers. The Product Information section enables companies to see their MRR by product or service plan.This section gives you insights into any recovered revenue or outstanding invoices. While Stripe is a first-rate payment processor and does provide some limited metrics, it does not give you everything you need to know to maximize the growth of your business. The MRR growth rate is a helpful metric for seeing how your company is doing over time, but it fails to provide a reasonable forecast of your future growth. While Stripe does display your MRR, it does not provide you with a revenue forecaster, and forecasting is too important to do on your own.Stripe does show your new and active subscriptions in its reports, but that doesn’t go far enough for maximizing MRR growth or minimizing involuntary churn. Without breaking down your overall MRR trend into differing plan quantities, upgrades, downgrades, failed charges, or refunds, it is difficult to see how expansion MRR, customer churn, contractions, etc. are all working together to produce your overall MRR trend.Indeed, dunning management is a crucial part of your SaaS business, and as such you probably want to look for an additional automation tool that integrates directly with your reporting. While you can see your churn rate according to revenue in Stripe, it doesn’t segment your downgrades from your cancelations. Since figuring out why customers are downgrading is different from why they are leaving, and the potential fixes to these are not the same, it is worth having them separated out.Stripe does not distinguish between customers on a trial version from those that are paying for service, which can drastically affect the reliability of MRR calculations.Stripe reports do not contain much customer information, and you cannot augment information using third-party data. Only by comparing yourself with similar SaaS businesses can you truly understand how well your business is doing. Stripe does not allow you to compare your business with others. The level of segmentation provided by Stripe is rather coarse. It does not give you the granular segmentation information, for example churned customers in specific regions on a specified plan, that Baremetrics does.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard.

      "Use Baremetrics to calculate LTV for Stripe customers.\n",
      "To run a business online, you probably need a customer relationship management (CRM) software package and/or payment processor to manage your customers and their invoices. This is because handling many customers across regions by hand is difficult, and in a competitive market there is no room for errors.Stripe is often the payment processor of choice for SaaS businesses because it can handle recurring revenue streams.However, the rudimentary analytics dashboard included in Stripe does not offer all of the functionality needed to maximize growth. Indeed, to get the most out of customer data, SaaS businesses often rely on a third-party analytics dashboard for everything from basic SaaS metrics to financial forecasting and customer segmentation. One of the most important metrics is customer lifetime value (LTV). The lifetime value of a customer is just what it says—the total amount of revenue earned by the average customer during the duration of their contract. While it might sound like a simple concept, calculating the average revenue per user (ARPU) and the customer churn, which are necessary components of the LTV calculation, is complicated because the information is coming from many sources.This complication can only increase when your customers tend to change pricing tiers, purchase add-ons, or you implement usage-based pricing.Thankfully, when it comes to calculating LTV for Stripe customers, along with all of the related metrics, Baremetrics excels. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, ARPU, churn, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.LTV is simply the average amount of money a customer pays you before they churn. This can be calculated as follows:LTV = ARPU × Customer LifetimeFor example, if your ARPU is $60/month and your average contract length is 20 months, then your LTV would be $60 × 20 = $1200. But how do you get to an ARPU of $60 or a contract length of 20 months?While the definition is simple, the calculations aren’t. That’s because there’s a lot of guesswork that goes into calculating the average length of a contract—and a lot of math to improve that guesswork. Since it isn’t possible to know the lifetime of your customer until they quit your service, or the average lifetime of your customers until a statistically meaningful sample of them leave, LTV is often calculated with churn:Customer churn is the percentage of customers that leave your platform during a specified period, usually monthly. It can be calculated as follows: If you have 1000 customers and 50 customers leave your site over the course of a month, then your customer churn is: (50/1000) × 100 = 5%.If your customers are paying the same amount monthly as above ($60), then your 5% churn gives you an LTV of 60/0.05 = $1200. Note that in the calculation you should use churn as a decimal not a percentage.LTV can be difficult to calculate because, whatever way you choose to calculate it, the numbers are not fixed. For example, if you have three pricing tiers and several add-ons, then your customers might be spending different amounts each month. This can make ARPU hard to pin down. That’s a pretty simple example, too. It could be that you offer discounts for the first few months of service or you give credit to paying customers if they recruit another client. Then there is the question of how to deal with permanent price increases or decreases. What if you have the enviable position of a very long average customer lifetime? In that case should you apply a discount rate to future ARPU?Churn can similarly jump around. It is often the case that customers do not churn linearly over the lifetime of their contract. Most companies will find that there is a sharp drop off after the first billing period along with some customers—hopefully the ones that truly find the value you offer and not just those that forget about their monthly payments—that just never quit. In this case, is it better to use an exponential function, and how does one do that exactly?These don’t even include the issues specific to calculating LTV for Stripe customers. For example, Stripe’s basic analytics dashboard might not differentiate between paid customers and trials when calculating MRR, MRR growth, and LTV. Although everyone in the industry would love it if every trial converted to a paid sign up, that’s an overly optimistic approach to forecasting!It can be difficult to calculate all of your needed revenue, customer, churn, and MRR movement metrics including LTV for Stripe customers directly on Stripe’s limited analytics dashboard. That’s why it is important to use Baremetrics to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.LTV is at its most valuable when it is combined with customer acquisition cost (CAC). CAC is the average cost of getting one new paid customer. LTV is often combined with CAC as the LTV to CAC ratio. An LTV to CAC ratio of 3 (i.e., you earn $3 in LTV for every $1 spent on CAC) is generally considered sustainable. If your LTV to CAC ratio is lower than 3, then you probably need to either find a way to onboard new clients for less or to increase your LTV. You can increase your LTV by improving your ARPU, i.e. increasing your prices or upselling to your customer pool, or decreasing your churn, i.e. increasing the length of your customer lifetime. To succeed here, you need to segment your client population and direct different actions to each group.When trying to calculate your LTV for Stripe customers, as well as the other needed SaaS metrics, directly on their platform, it can be difficult getting the fine grain detail needed. For example, it is important to understand the variation in your LTV based on different segments of your customers. This is something that Baremetrics can do automatically. The obvious follow up question is: Why is this important?Well, it helps you target your actions more effectively. For example, if your American customers are keeping their services three times longer than those in Canada, you might want to see what value Americans are getting out of your service that Canadians are not. For example, if your software has American but not Canadian tax compliance in mind, it could be time to look into developing that functionality for your international customers. If you have some customers paying annually while others paying monthly and see that annual customers tend to remain loyal to your business for a much longer period of time, then you might want to increase the discount you offer for paying on an annual basis. If you offer three tiers and notice that the bottom tier has a very low LTV compared to the others, then you might want to scrap it. It could be that the reduced functionality removes that magic element that makes your product worth using, and forcing clients to upgrade, possibly at the same price for an introductory period, would get them to see the true value of the platform you provide and increase their longevity. LTV is an important metric that is needed for decision making throughout the company. LTV is used to calculate your CAC budget, and its components ARPU and churn are used in many of your growth metrics. However, LTV is only part of the picture. Without a host of other metrics, it is hard to make optimal decisions. Calculating LTV for Stripe customers, along with all of these other metrics, directly in Stripe can be difficult. So, whatever payment processor or CRM you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Indeed, Baremetrics does all of this for you, and more.Baremetrics can even monitor your SaaS quick ratio.

      "Use Baremetrics to calculate Churn for Stripe customers.\n",
      "Churn is the share of your customer base that has stopped using your service over a defined period of time. It is usually measured per month. Churn can be calculated in two ways, namely customer churn and revenue churn, and there are good reasons to calculate both. Churn is a needed metric because it helps you calculate your customer lifetime value (LTV), forecast your MRR, and therefore budget how much you can safely spend on customer acquisition costs (CAC) while maintaining profitability. When you use Stripe, it can be hard to calculate customer churn as well as many other metrics on their limited analytics dashboard. While Stripe is an amazing payment processor and can help any SaaS business, you can only get the most out of their tools with a third-party analytics dashboard. That’s where Baremetrics becomes essential—you can use Baremetrics to automatically calculate churn for Stripe customers.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, including Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard. Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Customer churn is simply the percentage of customers that have quit your service over a set period of time:Customer churn rate (%) = (Customers that churned over a period of time/Customers at the start of that time period) × 100This shows you how quickly you are losing contracts month on month. For example, if you have 500 customers and lose 10 customers per month, then your customer churn is 10/500 × 100 = 2%. Customer churn can be separated into two main types: voluntary churn and involuntary churn.Voluntary churn is a regrettable fact of life. Some customers will choose to quit your service. Cancellation Insights can help you pinpoint why a customer has chosen to leave your platform, in hopes of preventing others from leaving for the same reason and win-back those customers you have lost. This said, it is unrealistic to believe that no one will ever want to leave your service.Involuntary churn, however, is absolutely frustrating and can be stomped out with enough effort. This is a situation where a happy customer is kicked off your platform due to some payment failure. In this case, Recover is an amazing tool to optimize your dunning system.An obvious question arises here: What causes Stripe payment failures? If you are using Stripe as your payment processor, which is a great choice by the way, then you might be wondering how your Stripe customers churn due to failed payments. There are four main reasons that Stripe payments fail as well as many rarer secondary reasons.‍While it is possible that a customer has just decided not to activate their new credit card, usually this means they haven’t updated their credit card information on Stripe. Frustrating for you of course, but who can blame a customer for not remembering to update their credit card on some sites when the modern company can be using dozens of subscription software packages? Proactive is the name of the game here—you need Recover to be proactively notifying customers when their credit cards will be expiring soon so that they remember to update their info before the older information no longer works.‍People move. That’s a fact of life, and most people have left a trail of spam mail addressed to them at every home they have ever lived. It has become a part of modern life to open up your mailbox and toss random sales pitches addressed to the previous 2, 3, or 10 tenants of your home. Unfortunately, with the rise of identity theft, fraud, and money laundering and therefore the need to strictly prevent them, failing to update your billing address for every single subscription you have will lead to failed payments.‍It can happen to the best of us—a forgotten payment or an unexpected cost can lead to your credit card reaching its limit. In addition to all the fraud checks mentioned above, in all the intricate handshakes among Stripe, payment gateways, customer banks, credit card companies, and merchant accounts, whether the credit limit has been reached is confirmed. If it has been reached, then the payment will fail.‍If your customer reports their card as lost or stolen and then tries to use it, either because they find the card and forgot they have already reported it missing or, more likely, because the details are still stored on Stripe, then the payment will fail.‍From the outside, online payments look pretty simple. This isn’t a mistake—smart shops, payment processors, and everyone else involved in the process are spending billions of dollars researching how best to make the online payment process as seamless as possible. However, behind the scenes, there are many things going on, often all within a few milliseconds, and each step in the background process can lead to failures. These mysterious errors are often the result of a bad API, and it can take the collective actions of your customer describing the error in the most detail possible, your technical team, and the Stripe technical support to solve the issue.Luckily, these issues are exceedingly rare, and in most cases involuntary churn for Stripe customers will be the result from some credit card error that can be prevented or corrected by a good dunning system in place. This is another reason why you should use Baremetrics to calculate churn for Stripe customers.While Stripe is an amazing payment processor, preventing involuntary churn requires a concerted effort. Here are some of the most effective ways to assess your involuntary churn and then work to minimize it.When you are looking to reduce churn, dunning management is only a part of the solution. Baremetrics has found that on average MRR is reduced by about 9% by involuntary churn. While that might seem low compared to the total amount of customer churn experienced by the average SaaS company, it is the low hanging fruit which can be recovered with the automated tools provided by Baremetrics.When looking at your involuntary churn, try to standardize your procedures as much as possible. This starts with automating the presentation of your customer churn information on your Baremetrics’ dashboard. Instituting a proper dunning process is the next step. In addition, don’t forget to make dunning emails a part of your procedure.This approach should be used with caution. You don’t need to spend too much time on Reddit to read story after story complaining about companies sending customers to collections, often for miniscule sums and years after the completion of service—and sometimes due to error for bills that had already been paid!Given the potential for bad publicity and ruined relationships, consider this a last option and only for use with clients that owe you enough to make it worth risking bad publicity and after all other reasonable efforts have failed.This is where Baremetrics comes in. From Cancellation Insights to Recover, Baremetrics can figure out why customers have chosen to leave or get them back when their churn is involuntary. Baremetrics is so confident in the service, that it is free for the first $1000 of recovered payments.On your Baremetrics dashboard, you can learn why customers canceled; you can also correlate lost revenue with cancellation reasons. In addition, Baremetrics can capture fresh insights regarding the reason for cancellation. With the insights you’ll gather on your dashboard, you’ll understand which missing features are driving your customers away and whether your retention efforts are working. That’s why Baremetrics is the best third-party dashboard for calculating the churn of your Stripe customers.Preventing churn is super important to any company. Most companies even have someone solely dedicated to churn reduction. The reason for churn usually stems from the product, but there are other subtle reasons, including involuntary churn. Keep in mind that the reasons above are just a start. To learn more and stay ahead of your customer churn, you should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your attrition rate accurately and efficiently.\n"

      "Use Baremetrics to calculate CAC for Stripe customers.\n",
      "Most online businesses use a customer relationship management (CRM) software package and/or payment processor to manage their billings because handling many customers across regions by hand is difficult, and in a competitive market there is no room for errors.For many SaaS enterprises, Stripe is the payment processor of choice. That’s because it has competitive fees among the big processors, it can handle recurring revenue streams, and it is easy to receive payments and send payouts across the globe.However, the rudimentary analytics dashboard does not offer all of the functionality needed to maximize growth. That’s why most SaaS businesses use a third-party analytics dashboard for everything from basic SaaS metrics to financial forecasting and customer segmentation. One of the most important metrics is customer acquisition cost (CAC). CAC represents the total cost to onboard a new paying customer. It can include everything from your sales and marketing expenses per new customer to the per customer cost of running your free trial. However, calculating CAC directly in Stripe can be difficult.When it comes to calculating CAC for Stripe customers, along with all of the related metrics, Baremetrics excels. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is essentially how much it costs to get a new client to sign up for your service. CAC can be calculated for all of your customers to date, but it is more commonly considered over a set frequency, for example monthly or yearly, to see how the cost structure is changing.  The basic calculation is to tally up all of the expenses specifically related to acquiring new customers and then dividing it by the number of new customers. The expenses included in CAC vary by company, but most include at least advertising and marketing expenses. You could also include the associated salaries, overhead costs, technical costs of running a free trial or any software used to track leads or conversions, and creative costs. Creative costs would include everything spent developing content for marketing campaigns across blogs and social media. That content also has associated publishing and production costs that could be included too. The amount of expenses you include in CAC versus ACS (average cost of service), which is the month-to-month cost of running your platform, can be a personal choice, but keep in mind that CAC is used for a lot of more advanced metrics, and, if you choose to inflate/deflate your CAC by shifting costs from/to ACS that other companies prefer to put in ACS, then the target values of these advanced metrics might need to be adjusted as well.For example, the customer lifetime value (LTV), which is the total amount of revenue garnered by the average customer over the duration of a contract, is often combined with CAC as the LTV to CAC ratio. An LTV to CAC ratio of 3 (i.e., you earn $3 in LTV for every $1 spent on CAC) is generally considered sustainable, but, if you fail to include the parts of overhead, technical costs, and salaries that are devoted to getting new paying customers in your CAC, then you may need a higher LTV to CAC ratio to reach sustainability. If we look at the CAC formula, we can see that it can decrease in two ways:Therefore, you can improve your CAC by either reducing the amount you are spending on acquiring new customers while maintaining the same customer increase or by maintaining your budget but getting more paying customers. Of these situations, the second is the better indicator that your company is becoming more popular and that all the content you are releasing is doing its job.It can be difficult to calculate all of your needed revenue, customer, churn, and MRR movement metrics including CAC for Stripe customers directly on Stripe’s limited analytics dashboard. That’s why it is important to use a third-party analytics dashboard to get the most out of your data.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services.

While it is impossible to really know how you acquired each customer just by information in cookies or what link they finally clicked when signing up for your service, if you can get information on this from surveying new customers, then it can be a great benefit to your marketing strategy.A modern SaaS business can be running both Google and Facebook Ads, managing LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook pages, have a podcast, and be diligently releasing content on their website’s blog. This can make it hard to segment your CAC for Stripe customers by marketing channel. That’s why many companies use an averaging system, where they calculate the cost of each separate channel and then allot an average number of new customers to each one. However, if you have 20 new customers and 10 channels, it is unlikely that each channel contributed exactly 2 new customers. In fact, it’s more likely that 7 of those 10 channels contributed 0 customers.However, don’t take that to mean that those channels aren’t important. It can be the case that a Twitter account generates zero new customers until a critical mass of followers—and big name followers especially—has been generated and then very quickly over months it becomes the best source of new clients.The other method that can be followed without directly asking your customers is called last touch attribution. This awards the new sale to the channel last touched before the sign up. For example, your new customer first saw your website through a Facebook Ad. They found your blog useful and so began to follow you on Twitter. They then clicked through a Tweet with a coupon code. The last touch attribute awards the new customer to your Twitter marketing channel.Once you have figured out your CAC by marketing channel, you can optimize your sales approach. This is important because the cost of acquiring a customer is often much higher than the cost of providing service in the SaaS industry. Optimization has two main tasks. The first is improving your conversion rate. This is easier said than done, but essentially the idea is to reduce the friction during every step of your funnel while highlighting all the benefits of your platform during the onboarding process. For example, while a free trial can help customers become acquainted with your system, it will be more effective if you pair it with well-crafted daily emails that explain the different features, how to use them, and why they add value.The second step is to allot your limited marketing budget to different channels based on how well they are doing. However, as mentioned above, it can both be difficult to measure the true impact of each channel, and some channels warm up over time (generally inbound marketing methods) while others tend to remain flat (generally outbound marketing methods).One important factor to optimize your CAC for Stripe customers is to know your ideal customer profile (ICP). This is basically an idea of who your customer is and why they want your service. By getting this as detailed as possible—including their location, needs, age, interests, and budget, among anything else you can think of—you can quickly focus your marketing efforts on the right place.CAC is an important metric. It can help you with decision making throughout the company. For example, if you have a high CAC, you might be better off increasing prices. In addition, if you have many marketing channels, CAC can help you decide on the ones that are worth focusing on. If your LTV is dragging down your CAC to LTV ratio, then it might be time to work on your dunning.However, CAC is only part of the picture. Without LTV and a host of other metrics, it is hard to make optimal decisions. Calculating CAC for Stripe customers, along with all of these other metrics, directly in Stripe can be difficult.

      "Top Ten Sales KPIs.\n",
      "Key performance indicators (KPIs) are how you track the progress of your company. Every department has its own KPIs, and figuring out what KPIs will best improve performance can be difficult. It can also be difficult to decide who in your firm is responsible for an individual KPI. For example, if your conversion ratio is low, is that because your marketing team is bringing in poor leads, your sales team isn’t succeeding in converting high-quality leads, or your development team hasn’t put the best parts of your platform at the front for a successful free trial? Each KPI you track gives you a small piece of the puzzle when trying to see how your platform, marketing, and sales come together to generate revenue. While not every piece is needed to understand the performance of your company, you’ll need to track more than one sales KPI to figure out how to best generate recurring revenue. In this article, we are going to go through 10 of the best sales KPIs available for SaaS companies that bring in revenue through a subscription model. But don’t calculate all these KPIs by hand! That would distract you from all the other important decisions needed to keep your MRR increasing. Baremetrics does all the heavy lifting for you, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. A crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your expenses, profit, and forecasted MRR for specific timeframes. All this allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start getting great sales KPIs automatically from your business’s transactions. Whether you are considering your sales KPIs or any others, effectively utilizing KPIs requires three specific strategic decisions: Marketing and sales are integral to your company. While your SaaS platform would not exist without developers and it would be so fiddly and ugly that no one would want to use it without your UI/UX team, it only stops being a hobby and starts being a company when you go out in the world and find customers willing to pay for your service. This is where sales KPIs come in.Measuring the success of your sales team requires KPIs. Every KPI seeks to give you some specific information about your company. Sometimes it is easier to understand the value of a KPI by looking at the question it seeks to answer.That’s why we list the 10 best sales KPIs along with one of the main questions they answer below:Keep these questions in mind when looking at the sales KPIs in depth below.Baremetrics provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and keep track of all your sales KPIs easily.Not all KPIs are complicated, and more complicated does not necessarily mean they garner more information. Looking at your change in MRR or ARR over time is a compulsory sales KPI to make sure you are moving in the right direction. To better understand your sales growth, consider calculating your SaaS quick ratio as well. You need to understand CAC, ARPU, and LTV together to get the most out of these three sales KPIs. Your LTV gives your development and marketing teams their budgets. By calculating your CAC, and with it your CAC payback period, you know whether or not your business is sustainable. Your CAC needs to remain below the LTV of your customers to produce profit and not just revenue.ARPU is calculated by dividing your MRR by the total number of customers signed up. If you have a high CAC or ACS (average cost of services), then you need to focus on increasing your ARPU by upselling your customers to improve your expansion MRR.LTV is probably the single most important sales KPI you can track. Knowing the total revenue generated by your clients is the first step in allocating budget to your sales and marketing team. It caps the amount your CAC can reach sustainably. You can improve your LTV in two ways: reducing your churn (i.e., extending the average contract length) or increasing the ARPU (i.e., having each customer pay more per month on average).Customer churn, as well as revenue churn, tells you how much you are losing monthly from your recurring revenue stream. It is important for calculating your LTV. Reducing churn, especially involuntary churn, can often be cheaper than increasing sales, so this sales KPI should always be tracked.The funnel is the basic sales planning chart of a SaaS business. It tracks the customer’s progress from being a visitor to the site through to a paying customer. Shortening this duration is a great way to improve your sales growth.Every potential lead starts out as unqualified, whereas a qualified lead is one that has been vetted in some way. The BANT method is a common form of vetting. BANT stands for leads with a budget, authority, need, and timeline requirements. If many of your leads do not become qualified opportunities, then you may want to improve your ICP (ideal customer profile).Assuming your qualified leads are actually of high quality, then you should be closing a reasonably high portion of them (somewhere around 15% of opportunities should become wins). If this isn’t the case, either your vetting process for leads is wrong or your sales approach needs work.Combining the lead-to-opportunity ratio and the opportunity-to-win ratio, the lead conversion ratio tells you how many of the initial leads become paying customers. This sales KPI gives an indication of the synergy between your marketing plan and your sales approach.Most SaaS businesses have multiple marketing campaigns ongoing at the same time. It can be hard to disentangle where a lead came from. If you can get customers to tell you this upon sign up, then you know where to focus your marketing budget going forward.Every sales KPI aims to answer one or more questions, which is why you need to track several to get a better picture of your business. This allows you to triangulate on the problems in your sales funnel.To go back to the hypothetical question from the top, by tracking several different KPIs, we can figure out what is to blame for a poor conversion ratio. The lead-to-opportunity ratio can tell you whether your marketing department is finding the right population to sell to. The opportunity-to-win ratio can tell you whether your sales department can capitalize on the high-quality leads garnered by the marketing campaign. By tracking both, you can pinpoint what needs to change to improve your company’s sales growth.

      "EBIT vs. EBITDA.\n",
      "EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is an indicator of a company’s operating profitability. It excludes interest and taxes for two related reasons.Interest is excluded to give the company a “debt-agnostic” view of their profitability. That is, it shows how the profitability of the company would look without having to pay for debt financing. This is done because paying interest on debt isn’t really related to the operations of a company. Similarly, taxes are excluded to give the company a “taxes-agnostic” (or jurisdiction-agnostic) view of their profitability. Since taxes often change from one year to the next, or from one location to the next, understanding the profitability of a company before the government is involved gives a clearer view of the decision making of a company, i.e., the profitability of the internal decision making of the company. Thus, by looking at the profitability with these two special expenses removed, EBIT presents the underlying profitability of the company.EBIT can be calculated in two different ways. The first method is additive, while the second is subtractive. In the first method, the bottom line of the income statement, i.e., net income, is added to the interest expenses and taxes. Effectively, this is working backwards from the final number by re-adding the two excluded expenses back:The second method starts with the net sales revenue and subtracts the expenses other than interest expenses and taxes. These include COGS (cost of goods sold) and operating expenses:EBIT = Sales revenue – COGS – operating expensesInterestingly, if EBIT is calculated using the second method, then it is always equal to operating income as defined by GAAP, but that is not always the case with the first method because net income can include non-operating income and/or expenses.Check out: Bookkeeping for Your SaaS BusinessEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is another measure of business profitability. Similar to EBIT, it excludes taxes and interest expenses for the same reasons as above. In addition to taxes and interest expenses, it also removes depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that turn tangible and intangible assets into expenses, respectively.Tangible assets include the things of value owned by your company that you can touch. This is anything from a laptop or desk to a building or plot of land.Conversely, intangible assets are anything of value owned by your company that you cannot touch. Intangible assets include your brand name, the relationships you have with customers as well as their signed contracts, and your platform.Most tax jurisdictions allow you to take the cost of these major purchases and spread their value out over many accounting periods. Since they are non-cash expenses, they affect your income statement but not your statement of cash flows. For this reason, calculating your EBITDA can help show the true financial health of your SaaS enterprise. EBITDA can be calculated following two different additive methods. They both follow the pattern of the first method of calculating EBIT only adding back more of the items subtracted from revenue to calculate your net income. The first method can be used when you don’t calculate your EBIT, while the second can be used when you do calculate your EBIT.In the first method, you start with your net income and then add back the four excluded expenses of interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization:EBITDA = Net Income + Interest Expense + Taxes + Depreciation + AmortizationIn the second method, you use your EBIT calculated previously according to either of the methods above as a shortcut. In this case, you only need to add back your non-cash expenses:EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + AmortizationIn the EBIT vs. EBITDA debate, neither comes out ahead as they both give different information, calculating both doesn’t take that much more time than calculating only EBIT or only EBITDA, and the information required to calculate them is all found in the same place (your income statement).Whereas EBIT is a measure of operating income, EBITDA is a measure of how your profitability is affected by non-cash expenses. When it comes to easy-to-calculate metrics, it is valuable to have as many as possible. When it comes to hard-to-calculate ones, the same is true, but don’t waste your time doing the calculations by hand.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources, and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.EBIT and EBITDA are highly related metrics, but they also have some key differences. Let’s look at their similarities and differences.The following are some of the similarities of EBIT and EBITA:The following are some of the differences between EBIT and EBITDA:EBITDA can be preferred to EBIT in two specific cases. First, as mentioned above, when a company has heavily invested in tangible or intangible assets, they have high depreciation or amortization expenses, respectively, which can drastically reduce their net income. In this case, their EBITDA might be a better indicator of their long-term viability. Second, when a company is being acquired, the purchaser might be more interested in their EBITDA than their net income since the non-cash expenses have already been paid and do not necessarily affect the future profitability of the acquisition target.Every company has a different structure, and which metrics best reflect the financial health of that company will change accordingly. While calculating dozens of financial metrics by hand is a distraction, the more information you have at your fingertips while making strategic decisions, the better.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services.

      "7 Cool Ways to Use the Baremetrics API.\n",
      "Data is cool. But you know what’s even cooler? Enriched data 🤓That’s one of the reasons why the Baremetrics API exists. It allows you to import information from other apps into Baremetrics easily and efficiently. This article will explain seven popular ways that Baremetrics customers use our API to enrich their data and get more insights from their Baremetrics dashboards. If you’re a SaaS or subscription business, you should use Baremetrics to track your metrics. Start a free trial today. API stands for Application Programming Interface. Simply put, APIs allow two applications to communicate with each other and access specific data. Developers use APIs when building and integrating their products with others. For example, the ability to log into apps using your Facebook credentials is possible because of the Facebook API. The app you’re trying to log into will use the Facebook API to authenticate your account and provide the identification information while mitigating security risks. The Baremetrics API works similarly. By connecting our API to your other applications, you’re authorizing Baremetrics to automatically receive certain information. To import data into Baremetrics and start seeing your metrics, you’ll need to connect a payment provider. Baremetrics currently offers integrations with Stripe, Braintree, Recurly, App Store Connect, Google Play, Shopify, and Chargebee.. If you are using one of those providers, you can sign up for Baremetrics and connect them right now! The Baremetrics API is a great solution for people who: Use a non-supported payment provider (anything other than the providers listed above)Need to connect a non-supported provider in addition to a supported provider Want to normalize billing data from various payment provider(s)Here’s our step-by-step guide for how to use the Baremetrics API for all tasks related to subscribers, plans, charges, refunds, segments, attributes, and more!  You can request both metrics and customer data to use outside the Baremetrics app. In this case, requesting essentially means the same thing as exporting. Using the API, you can request any of your metrics from a specific date or time period. For example, MRR from 8/1/2021 to 8/31/2021. These requests can be scheduled to happen automatically, which means less time needed to create reports. Best of all, this data can include data from different payment providers and is already normalized. This means your data is formatted in the same way for external reports, spreadsheets, or whatever you may need it for! Cancellation Insights is a powerful Baremetrics add-on feature. It automates the collection of cancellation data to help you better understand the reasons why customers leave. Cancellation Insights works in 4 steps. Step 1: Customer initiates the cancellation Step 2: A customized form prompts them to choose a reason for cancelling via in-app widget or emailStep 3: An automated follow-up email lands in their inbox to re-engage themStep 4: Data is collected in the Cancellation Insights dashboard, identifying trends and opportunities. Here’s an explainer video if that’s more your jam!The reasons mentioned in Step 2 are fully customizable. You can edit or delete reasons using the Cancellation Insights app, or using the API. The API support is ideal for folks who wish to capture this information while using their existing cancellation flow. The next four points will cover how the API brings in external information that enriches your customer data.With rich customer data, you can create more detailed customer segments. More segments means more knowledge and insight into your sales and marketing funnels.Customer Relationship Management tools are incredibly powerful. They help organize every step of the sales and marketing funnel, and keep detailed customer information in one place. Using the Baremetrics API, you can import customer information from CRMs into Baremetrics as attributes. More attributes means more possibilities to segment your customer base into specific groups.For example, if your CRM is tracking which salespeople work with each customer, you could import the names of your sales representatives into Baremetrics and then see which sales person is facilitating the most revenue. Here’s another example. Let’s say your team uses Pipedrive and labels SaaS companies in your sales funnel as “SaaS.” Using the Baremetrics API, you could import this label as an attribute into Baremetrics. Then, you can see how much money you make off of SaaS companies vs. ecommerce vs. any other label you choose.Doing this allows you to create customer segments and make instant comparisons in terms of MRR, LTV, or any of the 26+ metrics we track automatically. UTMs, or Urchin Tracking Modules, are code snippets attached to the end of URLs. Marketers use UTMs to:Track where leads come from Identify top-performing content Evaluate the efficacy of different campaignsUsing the Baremetrics API, you can create a custom attribute within the Baremetrics app, then import UTM information into the custom attribute of your customer’s profile. Then, you can segment customers by UTM to see from which channels you are getting your biggest and smallest customers from. Here’s what this looks like when it’s all done. This search filter is gathering customers who started a free trial from our blog homepage. Some apps monitor customer activity within their app in the form of web sessions. Others will also monitor specific behaviors such as button clicks, or number of files uploaded. If there is some behaviour in your app, and it’s possible to define and tag that behavior, then you could import the data as an attribute in Baremetrics using the API. You could do inquiries into your data such as “MRR from customers who have uploaded more than three files to their account”.You could also investigate the overlap between customer activity and LTV.  For example, what is the LTV of a customer who uses the product everyday vs. a customer who has only used the product once.Stripe users can import Stripe metadata to augment Baremetrics data. There are three ways to bring the metadata in, one of which uses the API. 1. Using our Customer Augmentation toolThis process involves mapping fields from a CSV file using customer email.Keep in mind you’ll need to import on a regular basis.2. Using the APIThis method allows you to map your customer information without customer email addresses. This is especially useful when you don’t have a customer’s email within Stripe since you can use the customer’s ID. Unlike the Customer Augmentation tool, the metadata will automatically import into Baremetrics. 3. Using Intercom If you have Stripe metadata in Intercom, our integration with Intercom will bring that in automatically.The Baremetrics API makes it easy to bring external data into Baremetrics. These are five valuable ways that our team and our customers use it, but the possibilities are endless. If you’re looking to try Baremetrics, start a free trial today.

      "What Is the Discount Rate and What Does It Mean for SaaS?.\n",
      "If you put a cookie in front of a room of kindergartners with the promise “if you don’t eat it now, you’ll get two later”, most eat the cookie. While these children aren’t necessarily acting rationally, what they are doing is saying that they’d rather less joy now than more joy in the future. That’s the essence of the discount rate. It basically stipulates that money today is worth more than money tomorrow, and most people understand this at a fundamental level before the finance people come in and complicate things. As people get vaccinated and the pandemic lockdowns seem to be leaving forever, economies across the world are heating up and inflation has hit recent highs. At 4%, without anything else, already $100 today is worth $96 next year. This is a first approximation of the discount rate.But that isn’t all, if you could earn 1% risk free on that money by buying some government bonds, then the difference grows further. If we add in the opportunity cost, i.e. the amount of money you could earn on that money, then the discount rate grows even higher. Finally, we need to think about risk and put it in there as well. All of these factors go into creating a reasonable discount rate for corporate financial planning. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Before we dive into discount rate, it’s important to note that discount rate and cost of capital are often used interchangeably. While discount rate and the cost of capital are similar and related concepts, there are some key differences. Understanding both is necessary to improve your corporate finance governance.Discount rate is used to determine the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate allows a company to calculate how much profit will come from a project over time, represented as the NPV (net present value). Since companies exist to earn profit, they need to understand the expected profitability of multi-year decisions. Companies base their discount rate on a set of reasonable assumptions considering the inflation rate, level of risk, and the opportunity cost of their decision.The cost of capital is the company's required return. Since lenders and investors expect to be paid back and earn profit, respectively, a company needs to ensure that every new capital outlay can bring in the minimum return necessary to please the bank as well as owners. Nobody knows what will happen in the future, which is why across the globe there are sayings such as “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” or “don’t count your hens before they hatch”. We simply don’t know enough about the future to feel any guarantee that we will be there to enjoy it. This is why we value things we have now more than the things we are promised to have in the future. In turn, this is why calculating risk and discounting based on risk is important. Let’s say you have the option to get paid $100 today or to flip a coin to potentially win $200. Would you do it? Most people probably wouldn’t since the coin flip has an expected value of $200/2, or $100, so taking the risk-free option would be more logical. But how much more would it take to convince you? A lot of this depends on the individual, but if it were, e.g., $220, then your expected risk premium would be 10%.Beyond risk, there is opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is essentially the value of the best decision not made. For example, let’s say you sold $1000 of your S&P 500 ETF and used it across a year to start a business. If that ETF went up 30% over that year, then the opportunity cost is $300 since $300 is the money you would have earned from the decision not made. While starting a business is a high-risk activity, businesses are usually run to minimize their risk. In this case, picking a discount rate for measuring the value of your projects is a sensible way of maintaining a conservative approach to business. So how can you use the discount rate in your SaaS business? One obvious situation is when calculating your customer lifetime value (LTV). The LTV is calculated as your average revenue per user (ARPU) times average customer lifetime (ACL). For example, if your ARPU is $200/year and the ACL is 2 years, then your LTV is $200 × 2 = $400. This is a pretty standard calculation, but it is also completely wrong. This ignores what value you could get out of the money in the meantime as well as the risk associated with getting the money next year. While we will go through some more practical and logical ways of building a discount rate below, for the sake of this simple example, let’s assume you’ve decided on a discount rate of 20%. In that case, the second year doesn’t add $200 to your LTV but only $160, putting your LTV at a significantly lower $360.Why does this matter? Two things come immediately to mind: First, SaaS companies have an expense structure built highly around CAC (customer acquisition costs). Second, SaaS companies, beyond their CAC, have an average cost of service (ACS) that is heavily frontloaded by the huge R&D expenses of building, testing, and rebuilding their platforms. (PS: If all these acronyms are getting to you, check out our article on SaaS financial metrics!)Both of these points lead to the same issue: you spend most of your money today and make most of your money tomorrow. If your CAC + ACS over those two years totals $100, then the discount rate might not matter so much. But if it is $380, then that’s the difference between making money on paper and making money in reality. Afterall, if you can earn more returns by putting money in the bank and taking a nap, then your business is in trouble.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard.

Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.To give you an idea of what different discount rates look like, take a look at the chart below. While corporations tend to pick higher discount rates when defining their hurdle rate, even a 5% discount rate makes money 50 years into the future essentially worthless today. The discount rate is fundamentally used to tell you two things: the net present value (NPV) and the discounted cash flow (DCF). The NPV is essentially the value today of all your future revenue less all your future expenses. It can be calculated for your whole company, an entire service plan, or for each customer. While most people know about their cash flow, few appreciate their DCF. As above, when flows out happen before the revenue is making flows in, the timing and size of those flows are important. The fact that money goes out first magnifies its impact on your company and means your revenue flows in need to be even bigger and more consistent to maintain the health of your company. The discount rate can also be used to account for the time value of money in general, compare investments that otherwise are too dissimilar for easy comparison, or calculate the riskiness of investments.In corporate finance, the discount rate usually comes down to one of the following numbers:The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used to calculate the enterprise value of a firm. The hurdle rate is a management-defined value that indicates the minimum return on investments needed for internal capital projects.The cost of equity is used to calculate the value of a firm.The cost of debt is used to calculate the value of a bond.The risk-free rate is used to account for the time value of money only.

      "What Is Cost Plus Pricing?.\n",
      "Cost plus pricing is one of the many pricing strategies employed by companies in an attempt to increase their revenue and profit.The basic idea behind cost plus pricing is to base your prices on the cost of production plus your desired profit margin. This makes it a very simple and safe pricing strategy. Using this strategy, you simply identify a price that you know will be above your cost of goods sold.However, while it may be simple and safe, and you can justify it to your team, whether customers will pay that price or it is the highest price you could charge is a different conversation. In this article, we will look at cost plus pricing, the rationale behind cost plus pricing, how to calculate a cost plus pricing price, and the pros and cons of cost plus pricing.Whatever pricing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data, including your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Integrating this innovative tool can make evaluating your pricing strategy seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.In a perfectly competitive market, prices are generally set by the market at the point where the short-run marginal cost equals the marginal revenue. However, in the long run, the marginal cost (i.e., the cost of the last unit produced) tends to overlap the unit cost (i.e., the average cost of all units), so in that case cost plus pricing tends to reach the same price point as the one found in a competitive market.Where cost plus pricing is found commonly is in larger one-off contracts. For example, a car mechanic might use cost plus pricing for replacement parts when doing work on a car, while a general contractor might use cost plus pricing when drawing up a contract for a house renovation.This is because, in cases where the cost structure is transparent to customers—for example, where you can find the contractor price of lumber at a local hardware store—the cost plus structure is seen as fair and reasonable. The price has two main elements: the cost to the supplier and the supplier’s markup. This leads to simple negotiations where the basement price is baked into the negotiable range—the supplier isn’t going to accept cost-minus pricing—and the ceiling is the supplier’s desired markup. For example, if a supplier is offering a cost plus 30% pricing scheme, instead of broad price negotiations, the customer is already restricted to the 30% portion of the price. If the customer manages to knock 20% off the margin, they’ve only actually reduced the price by less than 5%. While the customer may feel like they’ve gotten a big win, the final price is still acceptable to the supplier who is guaranteed a positive margin.In markets with a lot of competition, especially where every company is seen as essentially the same, companies do not have a lot of room to increase prices or set prices using a different pricing strategy. In these cases, a company can essentially collude with its competitors by following the industry standards when choosing its desired markup. Without putting too much time into researching the potential customers’ willingness to pay, the market structure, etc., a company can choose a safe, reasonable, and fair price. The cost plus calculation has two parts. First, you need to figure out the cost of your product. Second, you need to multiply that cost by your desired margin. We will take a look at an example below, but first let’s go through the mechanics behind these calculations. The cost plus pricing system can be broken down into three steps: calculate the total cost, calculate the unit cost, and add the markup.Step 1: Calculate the total costThere are two types of costs: fixed costs do not change based on the number of units produced, while variable costs do. Total cost = fixed costs + variable costsStep 2: Calculate the unit costThe unit cost is simply the total cost divided by the number of units produced:Unit cost = total cost/number of unitsStep 3: Add the markupThe markup is the amount you wish to earn on each product or service sold. It is usually considered a percentage, but here this needs to be made a dollar value: Markup = unit cost × markup percentageThis is then added to the unit cost to come up with the final selling price:Selling price = unit cost + markupNote that the markup percentage needs to be converted to a decimal for the first half of this step. You can also combine them by adding 1 to the value of the markup percentage expressed as a decimal. For example, a 30% markup can be written as 0.3, and plus 1 it is 1.3.Your company has fixed costs of $20,000, variable costs of $4,000, and sells 2,000 units. Your desired margin is 50%. Your total cost is $20,000 + $4,000 = $24,000.Your unit cost is $24,000/2,000 = $12.Your selling price is $12 × 1.5 = $18.In SaaS, the cost structure is generally broken down a bit differently. CAC (customer acquisition cost) and ACS (average cost of service), how much it costs to get a customer signed up (the marketing and advertising costs) and how much it costs to provide their service monthly, respectively, tend to be how costs are calculated. Both can have fixed and variable costs. For example, ACS includes the variable costs of hosting and maintaining the platform as well as the amortization of the cost to develop and test the platform, which is a fixed cost. The cost plus pricing system can still work, but you’ll need to figure out the average lifetime of your contracts, calculate the total cost, then figure out a desired markup, and finally get to a LTV (lifetime value) that matches the cost plus strategy.As with all pricing strategies, cost plus pricing has its pros and cons.The following are some of the advantages to using the cost plus pricing method.Since you should already have a handle on what your expenses are and the margins you need to maintain a growth trajectory, cost plus pricing is an easy way to set your prices.Since costs are built into the pricing structure, every contract will be profitable.This strategy doesn’t require anything in the way of market research or a review of competitor prices, so it is a cheap way to set prices.Since you put your desired margin at the heart of your pricing decisions, you know your approximate rate of return will remain stable.The following are some of the disadvantages of using the cost plus pricing method.Without consideration of competitors’ prices, there is a good chance you are charging way too much or way too little. While the former will leave you with no customers, the latter will be robbing you of higher profits and the cash flow needed to expand.Suppliers have no incentive to work efficiently, so, while cost plus pricing might look reasonable to start, overruns often occur and the final price ends up higher than anticipated.Since all expenses are built into the price directly, your company is unlikely to operate lean. There is no reason to reign in unnecessary expenses.If your consumers aren’t privy to your internal cost structure, then cost plus pricing means little to them. A consumer would rather pay based on the value you give them than the cost you incur during production.While cost plus pricing is popular in certain markets, in others it won’t work. For SaaS, it is a reasonable way to internally define the minimum price you are willing to accept, but your customers will care little about the cost of providing your services.

      "How to Make It Through the Pre-Revenue Startup Phase.\n",
      "The pre-revenue startup phase has a host of stresses that hopefully disappear as the company begins to earn revenue.Depending on the amount invested, it is possible that all members of the team are working full time jobs to support themselves and then doing that again to push their startup onto the market. You also might need to be watching your burn rate extra closely as the pre-revenue stage is by no means the pre-expense stage.This stress and the high risk of failure that comes with it is why founders are trying to accelerate their pathway through the pre-revenue startup phase. In this article, we are going to go through the stages of a pre-revenue startup, how to seek funding, and the tools available to help you through all of this. The advanced analytics and reporting tools Baremetrics offer provide affordable, fast, and flexible means to maximize your SaaS revenue.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.A pre-revenue startup is just that—a new company that has not yet begun to earn revenue. This might be by choice to build a brand before seeking ad revenue, by necessity while developing a platform, or unexpectedly during the search for your first clients.The pre-revenue phase is generally considered to have five basic stages.The pre-revenue startup typically goes through five stages:ResearchFrom idea to MVPGetting tractionBack to the start: final improvementsAiming for maturityLet’s take a quick look at each of them.It is easy to think up an idea that is worth millions or even billions. I once had an idea for a company where you can rent out your spare room. Unfortunately, I was a bit late. While brainstorming ideas is important, you also need to be seeing if there are already companies out there offering the same thing. If there are already companies out there, don’t fret—you don’t need to be the first, best, only, or biggest business pursuing an idea, you just need to come at it from some unique perspective. It might be that you offer better service, or cheaper service, or service in the suburbs when it previously only existed downtown, or you are differentiated in one of a thousand other ways.Come up with a logical research plan that focuses on the competitors and prospective clients, and work in a way that fills any gaps you find. You have probably heard of a minimum viable product (MVP). You’ve probably also heard the following quote by Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn: “If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.” These are sacrosanct to startup culture, and for good reason. It is better to have your product out there building up views than sitting in the drawing room while new competitors are gaining notoriety. There are two good reasons for this. The first is that first movers in business have an innate advantage in marketing. The second, possibly more important one is that you need your product being tested by fresh eyes, and honest ones. You need the feedback of honest, possibly paying users who will tell you exactly what is wrong with your product, and if you wait beyond your MVP to something more “complete,” then you’ve wasted months of good feedback and the good development that comes from that feedback.But how do you get your idea to an MVP?Start by buckling down and coming up with a reasonable developmental timeline—and then stick to it. If you’ve never been self-employed, then you might not be used to following your own schedule and this is going to be a learning experience.Figure out what needs to be done and make sure you have the expertise to do it. If you can’t do it now, it is time to update your skillset or find someone who does have those skills. Get the input of people who might want to use your product along the way. If at any point you are unsure about the direction of your idea, rely on those who will use it to guide you to success.This is where you really go out there and try to push visitors to your site. This can be especially difficult if your startup is mostly developers as it requires a different set of skills.Here are some suggestions:Catchy branding: Find a way to set your brand apart so people recognize it instantly.Promotions: If you have the funds to do marketing, figure out where your customers are likely to visit, and put ads on those sites. Offering potential clients special early bird discounts can go a long way to improving the effectiveness of cold emails.Partnerships and referrals: Are there popular websites or influencers in your chosen industry? Consider setting up a referral or partnership to drive more early traffic. The great thing about an MVP is that it will give you immense, real-time data about how your platform is being used. You can instantly see which features are popular and which aren’t. This will help you refine things. Start to trim away the unwanted features and expand those that are well-liked. Now is also a good time to start going deep on your UI/UX game to make the platform as pretty and easy to use as possible.This might seem like the easiest step—you are known, have traction, the product is well-liked, and you are growing steadily. However, there is also a culture change to becoming a mature company. If you are addicted to triple-digit growth to make up for an inefficient business model, then you will find it especially difficult to enter maturity. Sometimes the best way to become a mature, well-managed company is to find partnerships. Although you may want to avoid selling a portion of your company to some angel investor or venture capitalist, because of the all-too-real horror stories of seeking capital floating around the Internet or because you don’t want to lose control of your baby, a good VC might bring more value as the experienced grown up in the room than as the wallet.  Every SaaS company needs its financial metrics, and that is true during the pre-revenue phase as well as when slowly building up your subscription revenue stream. Tracking all of these metrics by hand is impossible, and when you are just starting out paying for a metrics service is an unnecessary expense.That’s where Baremetrics comes in. Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly on your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Best of all, until your company reaches a robust $2,500 MRR, Baremetrics does all of this for free!Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.While there are no shortcuts to raising capital, most investors are looking for some specific things out of you.The following items prove not just that your business is worthy of an investment but that you are as well.Plan: They are going to want to see your plan from Day 1 to today as well as today to the future, 3 and 6 months out as well as 1, 2, and 5 years from now. Have you met the milestones you set in the past? Are you on pace to meet your next several? While this includes your hard numbers (ARR, MRR, LTV, etc.), it can also include your hiring practices, the iterating of your platform, and so much more.Product: It is unlikely that you’ll find an investor without a fully fledged MVP at minimum. Keep an eye on product development as well as how users interact with your product to increase the value of your company.Traction: Investors want to know your web analytics to see your popularity as well as the harder numbers—your ARR, MRR, LTV, CAC, etc.Market: A strong market research presentation can convince an investor that you are also serious about making money. It shows not just the potential value of your company, but how you personally are going to navigate your way to profitability.Team: If your team is comprised solely of amateurs, then that can be a red flag for a lot of VCs. If you aren’t an expert in the market you are entering, then you should be sure that you have those experts on your team and that your finance presentation proves you are taking personal growth seriously.While most founders dream of running their company forever, others are more interested in being “starters” than “managers”—they want the thrill of creating something useful from scratch, and all the management decisions end up pushing them away from the development roles they love. That’s where Microacquire can come in handy. Unlike the painstaking back and forth and due diligence of traditional acquisitions, to sell your company on Microacquire, all you need are your up-to-date metrics.With as little as your MRR, churn, web analytics, number of customers, LTV, CAC, etc., you can find a buyer for your company and start your next big project—this time with a little more protein and a little less ramen. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more, which is exactly what you need to find a buyer or an investor. Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "Community Marketing: Build Community in Your Customers’ Areas of Interest.\n",
      "The rise of hyper-targeted ads on social media has allowed even the largest companies on earth to provide a tailored message to each prospective customer. They can mimic the feel of a local mom and pop shop and forge a real connection with the people seeing their ads. In such a world, connecting deeply with customers is the only way to maximize your brand value and inspire loyalty in your customer base. Building a thriving community with your brand in the center is the first step in a community marketing approach, and if done correctly it will push your revenue into the stratosphere. So, let’s go over what community marketing is, why it works, and how to get started with building a community around your brand.Whatever your community marketing approach, understanding how your prospective clients respond to your pitch is important. When trying to figure out your market, track your revenue metrics closely.Baremetrics is a business metrics monitoring tool that acts as a dashboard for your business. You can see MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly on your Baremetrics dashboard. Check out the demo account here.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.The fundamental principle of community marketing is making the message about them (the customers) and not you (the business). To do this, community marketing strives to build a community around some topic related to the brand, or a set of values aligned with the brand. The most common example of the former is sports—a brand makes itself a part of the image of the sport, and often replicates that success in more and more sports communities. A modern example of the latter is a company projecting a green image on its brand—showing how the brand is particularly climate conscious or that the business is using its visibility and success to promote an environmental policy objective.A cynic might think it is easy to fake these connections (indeed, the term “green washing” is used frequently), but customers are incredibly savvy and no community marketing scheme entered into with a cynical motive will last long—and community marketing very much works best as a long-term strategy. Community marketing can be broken down into two systems:To really understand what community marketing is and how it fuels brand growth, we need to define what a community is and learn a bit about the psychology behind the human need for connection.Communities have three key components:There are three main markers of a brand community:Community marketing has been a victim of its own success. With every brand trying to build a community, and every marketing manager claiming to be an expert on community marketing, many of the so-called community marketing campaigns today aren’t really community marketing at all. This has led to there being many myths out there about community marketing.Sometimes big crowds can be as lonely as sitting at home. If a community grows too much or too quickly, then in some ways it ceases to be a community at all. Furthermore, with many new voices, your voice might get drowned out, and with it months of hard work building up trust within the community.Some of the most successful community marketing campaigns have actually created their community. They have brought people together over some shared interest when either the people who shared the interest had no idea there were so many like-minded others, or they saw no need for a community to share their interest. If you can find the people individually who share the passion, then you can bring them together and build the community together.Different people have different expectations about community. Even though they have the same interests, they may not wish to fulfill their need for community in the same way. If a community already exists around some niche and there doesn’t seem to be room for your brand, try to unite people around a parallel group.If you can find a way to engage with the people who do not wish to join the current community, then you can develop a competing one with your brand in its center from the beginning.You’ve identified a compatible community in line with your brand image and one that seems fruitful for a community marketing campaign. That’s great, but don’t just flood this new group with mediocre ads.To succeed at community marketing in the long term, follow the strategies below.The expectations of companies on social media have changed drastically in the last few years. They expect your advertising, replies, posts, etc. to be informative. If someone asks you a question about your service, they expect a complete and timely answer.A true member of a community is taking part regularly. This goes double if you want to be there as part of a community marketing scheme. Keep up your presence even after you are seeing the loyalty gains or expect to be replaced.If you belong in the community, show it. As a person getting paid to contribute to a community that is mostly made up of people on their free time, your contributions should be of particularly high value and show that you are a pro. As mentioned above, the word-of-mouth, organic community marketing works best, so try and get people on board and ready to sing your praises. There is nothing better than logging on to a community for a day of engagement to see others already praising your business and its efforts in the community.Find new and varied ways to engage. Video, podcasts, and blogs are all geared to different kinds of people. Figure out which effort connects best with your community and engage as much as you can, but don’t overpower the community otherwise it will just be seen as an ad channel and the real members will find somewhere else to meet.People bring their interests, hobbies, passions, etc. to the community because they want to engage. If you want to be seen as an authentic part of that community, then you need to engage too. No one is going to remember which company sponsored 50 saplings to be planted in a community greening project, but the company that comes with the cash and 20 volunteers to shovel will really impress people.Community marketing is a long-term strategy. It can take months to gain the respect of a community and be seen as part of it. A couple of months is not long enough to judge the value of your effort.Community marketing isn’t for everyone, and it isn’t for every company. Let’s look at some specific advantages and disadvantages of community marketing.The following are among the major advantages of community marketing:Better customer experience Brand and customer humanization More relevance and loyaltyWord of mouth growth The following are among the major disadvantages of community marketing:High commitmentLong-term approachUnique skill set requiredIf you’re looking for a smarter way to measure the effect of a new marketing strategy, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Have a look at the demo today to see how Baremetrics can show you the results of your marketing decisions.\n",
      "What Is Penetration Pricing?.\n",
      "Penetration pricing is one of the many pricing strategies employed by companies in an attempt to increase their revenue and/or profit.Penetration pricing is the strategy of offering extremely low prices when entering a market to entice customers to try a product or service. It works best in very crowded markets where it is hard to attract customers away from more established brands.Penetration pricing is a particularly effective option when it is difficult to show a client your higher quality or special value without them trying your service. This is especially true when demand is elastic (i.e., it is very sensitive to the price) and economies of scale are very apparent (i.e., the marginal cost decreases as the size of the firm increases).If that is confusing or too theoretical, don’t fret, as we will go through what that means with some graphs and an example below. We’ll also walk you through the pros and cons of using a penetration price strategy, as well as compare it to its mirror strategy, price skimming.Whatever pricing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data; including your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Integrating this innovative tool will make evaluating your pricing strategy seamless for SaaS companies, and you can start a free trial today.Penetration pricing is used to quickly gain market share, especially in a crowded market. It is often combined with certain psychological pricing strategies to give the impression that the prices will go up soon, thus prompting potential customers to hastily make a purchase for fear of missing out.While the system is an effective way to get customers to sign up initially, if your service doesn’t meet the standards of the market, don’t expect customers to stick around as the price goes up.The major objectives of penetration pricing can be summarized as follows: All of these goals are achieved through offering extremely low prices for an introductory period.Indeed, the margins can be slim, zero, or even negative during a penetration pricing campaign, which means that you could be burning profit during the campaign or experiencing a negative cash flow. This is an unsustainable position in the long run, which is why penetration pricing, as well as the price skimming technique discussed next, is always a short-term strategy.Price skimming and penetration pricing are essentially the opposite strategies. Whereas price skimming uses initially high prices to earn revenue, penetration pricing uses initially low prices to get more sales.While price skimming is best used with unique or new products, penetration is best used when the market is highly competitive and customers are quite loyal to their brand of choice.Some caution and discretion is required for both, however. While penetration pricing will leave you earning less revenue per client when used for too long, price skimming will start to attract competitors that feel they can beat your prices if given the chance.Penetration pricing is best used under very specific market conditions.First, when there is very little distinction between competitors’ products and your own, it is difficult to differentiate in any way other than price. Since customers usually exhibit some level of brand loyalty, unless you (temporarily) have lower prices than the competition, it will be difficult to gain a market share.Second, when demand is price elastic, which means that the level of demand heavily depends on the price, it is easier to entice consumers away from their current brand of choice, and it is more likely that a penetration pricing strategy will succeed. Finally, when the total cost structure of your company signals that you’ll have positive economies of scale (i.e., the marginal cost of your product will decrease as the level of production increases) then as your company gains more customers, the price you can offer sustainably will decrease. Moreover, a large market share will be a fundamental requirement of long-term success. You’ve just built a great SaaS platform in a competitive market. The R&D costs were very high, but the cost to maintain and host the service per client is very low. Because of this, your marginal cost decreases rapidly from $15 to $10, if you can increase the number of subscribers from Q1 to Q2.The competitor currently prices their product at $30, and you think it will take a price of $12 to initially get customers to try your service. Let’s look at this graphically: You know that, so long as you can work your way to a market share that garners you a sales volume of Q2 that you will be profitable in the long run.Once you reach Q2, your plan is to slowly raise prices until they are in line with the competition.If you’re looking for a smarter way to measure the effect of a new pricing strategy, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Have a look at the demo to see how Baremetrics can show you the results of your marketing decisions.Penetration pricing is a great way to gain market share quickly, but if you do not have a lot of cash on hand then you might find yourself insolvent before you become established in the market. While you may be able to garner a big market share, there is no guarantee that that market share will want to remain loyal to you as you bring your prices in line with market norms. Let’s look at some of the other advantages and disadvantages of penetration pricing.The following are some of the advantages of penetration pricing. The following are some of the disadvantages of penetration pricing. While penetration pricing can get you some quick market share, there is no guarantee that you can keep that share once your prices go up. In addition, if your marketing strategy isn’t successful, then your low prices may need to stick around longer than you can afford to offer them. Ultimately, penetration pricing is a great short-term strategy, but it might be better to entice potential clients into longer contracts with these low prices so that you have a longer time to convince them of the value your services bring to their companies before they decide to renew at the market rate.Baremetrics is the obvious choice for SaaS businesses seeking to better track their revenue while making major pricing strategy changes.If you’re looking for a smarter way to approach your SaaS business’s revenue performance, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Marketing channels are only as good as their results.

      "What Is Price Skimming?.\n",
      "Price skimming is one of the many pricing strategies employed by companies in an attempt to increase their revenue and/or profit.Price skimming is a pricing strategy for when a product enters the market. The price is initially set at the highest possible number some customers will find acceptable and then lowered slowly over time to improve the volume of transactions. This pricing strategy is named for “skimming” the top layers of cream from milk. This is meant to signify the company getting more of the consumer surplus as it works the price down the demand curve.If that is confusing or too theoretical, don’t fret as we will go through what that means with some graphs and an example below. We’ll also walk you through the pros and cons of using a price skimming strategy as well as compare it to its mirror strategy, penetration pricing.Whatever pricing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data, including your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Integrating this innovative tool can make evaluating your pricing strategy seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.Price skimming in a nutshell is a firm selling its product or service for a very high price when it is first released only to slowly lower its price over time until it reaches the desired long-term price.Price skimming usually relies on the product being unique or especially desirable, so you often find price skimming happens in new markets or when timely ownership has a greater perceived value. This is part of the “first mover” principle.An example of the former is a new electronics device. When a new PlayStation or iPhone drops, the increased functionality appeals to so-called early adopters enough that they’ll pay more for the product. By offering the product initially at a higher price, Sony or Apple can obtain increased profits from that motivated segment of society before bringing the price in line with the true market equilibrium for higher volume.An example of the latter is clothing. Fashion companies routinely set high prices for new apparel only to rapidly discount the price (sometimes dishonestly using psychological pricing) week on week. To some people, a shirt is a shirt, while, to others, it is an expression of their personality, a status symbol, or evidence of their style. In that case, there are two separate markets for the product, and by going from the high price to the low price the company can benefit maximally from both.In a perfectly competitive market, the price is set where supply meets demand. From the perspective of the company, this is where the short-run marginal cost meets the marginal revenue. In this case, the demand and supply curve make an “X” on a price/quantity graph. The left side of the price–quantity graph shows the consumer surplus above the price and the producer surplus below the price. The consumer surplus is essentially all the added benefit provided to the group of people who bought the product (“utility”). Since the people on the demand curve above the price (Pc) would have been willing to pay more for the product than the market price, they got more joy than they needed to be satisfied by the purchase.The producer surplus, similarly, is the amount of excess benefit gained by the producer based on the number of products sold. We can see this in the graph below:Instead of being satisfied with the blue part, companies that use the price skimming strategy attempt to take part of the red area by setting price higher at first and then slowly reducing the price over time as they capture those particularly motivated buyers.The graphs below show how using price skimming, instead of the competitive equilibrium price, the company can segment the demand into groups and charge P1, then P2, and finally Pc (c for competitive) over time to get bigger and bigger chunks of the total surplus.The main reason companies use price skimming is to recover their fixed costs more quickly. In the SaaS world, the amount of money spent on developing, testing, and refining a platform can far outweigh the costs of hosting and maintaining the service. With a carefully designed price skimming strategy, the company can reduce the time it takes to recover their initial sunk costs.Penetration pricing and price skimming are essentially the opposite strategies. Whereas price skimming uses initial high prices to earn more revenue, penetration pricing uses initial low prices to get more sales.While price skimming is best used with unique or new products, penetration is best used when the market is highly competitive and customers are usually quite loyal to their brand of choice.Both price skimming and penetration pricing are best used for a short time. While penetration pricing will leave you earning less revenue per client when used for too long, price skimming will start to attract competitors that feel they can beat your prices if given the chance.A company releases a new smartphone. It has conducted a lot of market research and knows that its most loyal 10% of customers are willing to pay almost any price to get the product on Day 1, another 40% are willing to pay elevated costs to get their phone before the end of the year, and the remaining 50% of potential customers do not see much value in the brand image or the new technology and are only willing to pay the competitive market rate for smartphones.The company decides on a release price (P1) of $800, a follow up Back-to-School campaign price of $700 (P2), and then to lower the price on Black Friday to the competitive price (Pc) of $500. The company expects 1 million people to buy on release, 4 million to buy during their Back-to-School event, and 5 million to buy a phone on Black Friday. In a competitive pricing scheme, the company would have earned $500 × 10 million = $5 billion.However, by price skimming, they earn ($800 × 1 million) + ($700 × 4 million) + ($500 × 5 million) = $6.1 billion.Price skimming has a lot of benefits, but it also can be a dangerous pricing strategy.Let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of price skimming.The following are some of the advantages of price skimming.While the focus has mostly been on the advantages of price skimming, there are some notable disadvantages as well. Let’s take a look at some of them.While price skimming can be a good driver of excess profits and help you recoup development costs quickly, it can also harm your relationship with your most loyal customers.

      "A Guide to Resonance Marketing.\n",
      "The challenge of marketing is that in order to be effective, it must keep reinventing itself.Old strategies lose their punch because platforms are oversaturated, and available data sets overexploited.Marketing bombards us all day long, both online and in real life.The biggest hurdle is to get people to pay attention. To achieve that, your targeted marketing must break through the background noise with something fresh.Let’s take a look at what we can learn from Resonance Marketing.If you could benefit from an in-depth analysis of your SaaS business’s financial health, Baremetrics is the perfect tool for you. Track over 26 different metrics, see who’s trialling your software, and get tips on where to find your Ideal Customer Profiles by trying out the free trial today.Have you noticed your sales figures suddenly drop off, stagnating your business growth?There are several reasons why this could occur. Some of the most common ones are:As you can see, the latter two revolve around marketing issues, which is the focus of this guide.In response to an unrelenting pressure to evolve, most marketing strategies actually end up following the newest popular trends, and in so doing, obsolesce much faster.Some years ago, email outreach enjoyed high response rates. But as cold contacting leads became the norm, effectiveness rapidly declined.Social media turned into the new medium of choice for casting a wide net. Wide net campaigning on Facebook and equivalent platforms resulted in two things: advertisements weren’t customized enough to effectively hook leads, and everyone was seeing ads aimed at everyone else. The total platform swamp encouraged users to skip past all paid content on their feeds, so even if an ad came along showcasing a product they could really benefit from, it wouldn’t grab their attention.LinkedIn connect requests took the marketing world by storm a few years ago, until users became so annoyed by the resulting blend of organic and paid connections that the platform itself started imposing heavy restrictions on how many connection requests an account could make in a week.Most recently, we found ourselves back on social media, but this time, sending direct messages to a narrower pool of potential leads. For this to be effective, DMs required quite a high touch approach that didn’t always see ROI in the long run.The short answer is, you can’t. Not forever, in any case. As available technology, and just as importantly, culture itself evolves, marketing either adapts to meet users where they are, or simply becomes irrelevant.There is, however, one constant in these changing tides: resonance.Resonance marketing emphasizes brand identity and shared values over the logistical aspects of a traditional sales pitch (such as price point, performance, ROI etc).Here we’ll break down how to use the foundations of resonance marketing to create campaigns that hit home every time.Whether you’re branching out into new target segments, or you have a limited audience pool you’ve already exhausted and are contacting again, there are 3 facets to develop in your campaigning:RelevanceRelevance breaks down into two factors: who, and when.First of all, your campaign needs to target the right audience, i.e. your Ideal Customer Profiles.You’ll need to find out who these people are, run data analyses into your prospects, and interview converted ICPs for their patterns that you can use to run projections.For a step by step guide, here is a detailed handbook on developing your ICPs. And here is a how-to for analyzing user behavior with customer segmentation using Baremetrics. The second factor, timing, takes into consideration any major inflection points in a prospect’s work-life that could signal a good time to strike.Conduct research into the public data of leads to find any of the following changes:If you’ve reached out to a lead before but they didn’t convert, it’s worth taking another shot if they, or their business, recently underwent some major changes.That said, first impressions do count, so you’ll want to switch up something significant in your campaign’s relevance, reach, or message, to trigger a different outcome.ReachThe mechanics of reach are fairly simple.The first step is to track down the contact information of your leads using software tools like data scrapers (see tip 2).The second step looks deeper into a prospect’s habits so you can assess where they, and users like them, do business.This information will highlight which platforms you can reach them on, what the best timing for contact is, and how they are most likely to engage with your content.MessageThe third aspect of resonance marketing is your campaign message itself.In order to be effective, this process requires rigorous testing. As you implement incremental changes, be meticulous about documenting the exact impact of each tweak you make.Here are some of the elements you can conduct A/B testing on:The results of these tests, if segmented correctly, should speak for themselves. If by the 10th iteration you’re not seeing notable results, this is an indication that there is something fundamentally wrong with your campaign thesis. It’s time to take a big step back and look at the key assumptions you’re making.If you need a fresh perspective, here are some alternative marketing strategies to check out.Your message should be true to your brand identity above all else. The purpose of this testing process is to identify what matters most to your prospects, so you can emphasize those features during outreach.High impact campaigns are founded on quality of research, leveraged expertly.Mined data serves the following purposes:Data sets, on the whole, are extremely overexploited. The more easily data can be accessed, even for a fee, the more people will already have leveraged it.The better your detective work, the more valuable the data you retrieve will be. Make sure you’re doing this primarily for high value ICPs though, so you’re seeing good returns.Where to lookThere’s a plethora of tools out there to help you locate the data you need on your ICPs. Different platforms specialize in different types of data sets. Here is a useful guide on using sales data tools for SaaS businesses.Fundraising data:Technographic data (what tools a company is using):Job change data:Review page data:The collective price tag on these tools is too high for most start-ups. Choose which ones make the most sense for your business, and build from there.Don’t forget to dig into your own past for some of the best data. Post-mortem looking into which parts of your past campaigns worked, and how conversions correlated with your clients’ inflection points in retrospect, yield veritable goldmines of information.Better yet, keep track of these inflection points as they happen. There'll be less data to work through while you’re actively campaigning, and as a bonus, you’ll be able to spot potential churns before they happen.How to interpret dataThe best way to interpret the data you’ve uncovered is segment by segment. Here’s a guide on how to do that using Baremetrics’ large scope of metrics. Try it out for yourself using the free 14 day trial here.Some of your best data sets on prospects are already in your lap – simply look into the features and behaviors of your current customer base. Many of these qualities will be replicated among your leads.This data is so valuable for two reasons: you have the opportunity to interview your clients directly, and you’re the only one with access to that exact data set.How to leverage data sets effectivelyThe fuller the picture you have on your targets, the more you can adapt your approach. This gives your messaging the best chance to truly resonate with its audience.The most effective high touch campaigns stitch together all available information to create an approach that, to the prospect, feels like it was custom-made only for them.Here’s an example of a customized email automation that plugs in all this data:As you can see, this cold email pulls information about the prospect’s company size, ad spend, and top customers, to create a highly customized approach. Sprinkle in some common pain points and bold promises - that’s powerful!Research is an invaluable investment into your business growth.Resonance marketing requires your outreach to be relevant to prospects in timing and intent, have an effective reach, and wield a strong message.And at the core of any powerful, 3-dimensional campaign, lives data.\n"

      "What Is Psychological Pricing?.\n",
      "Psychological pricing is one of the many pricing strategies employed by companies in an attempt to increase their revenue and/or profit. In the case of psychological pricing, the strategy is to rely on the behavioral traits of consumers to increase revenue. While some psychological pricing strategies can be seen as manipulative, which might decrease sales in the long term as consumers see the company as dishonest, others are common price hacks that seem to be well tolerated by most people and effective.Since no single pricing strategy is going to be sufficient in reality, the different forms of psychological pricing can all cooperate with your other pricing strategies, from bundle pricing to cost plus pricing, to ultimately optimize your prices.In this article, we will go through what psychological pricing means, some common forms of psychological pricing, and the advantages and disadvantages of psychological pricing.Whatever pricing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data, including your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Integrating this innovative tool can make evaluating your pricing strategy seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.Psychological pricing comes in many forms, but all of them have one thing in common: they are tricks. Now, not all tricks are equal, and they aren’t always deceitful, but they do rely on knowledge about human behaviors to make a price seem a bit more palatable. Let’s look at some common forms of psychological pricing.If you like heading to the mall every weekend, then you’ve probably looked in the front windows of every shop and thought “do they ever not have a sale on?” This is the essence of artificial time constraints. These shops are creating the illusion that the current prices are ending soon when in reality the prices will largely be static over time—that “Back-to-School” sale ends just as the “Halloween” sale heats up, which gets you to the “Turkey Time”, then “BLACK FRIDAY”, and “Christmas” sales, which lead right into the “End of the Year Blowouts.”A newer form of this can be found online, where websites claim the product is offered for only a limited time, but of course that time limit is fake.This form of psychological pricing relies on “FOMO” or the fear of missing out. Nobody wants to miss out on anything, even if it is something you don’t actually want. At this point, it should be pretty clear why some people think psychological pricing is dishonest.This is where everything ends “.99.” Researchers have found that, since people look at the price from left to right they have a “left-side bias,” which basically means that they don’t look at the numbers following the decimal point. A price of $1.99 is perceived by consumers the same way as $1 even though it is practically the same as $2.Interestingly, the association of prices ending in 9s with value has led to an opposite effect where many people see prices ending in 0, or prices that do not have anything after the decimal at all, as prestigious. You often see this implemented at fancy bistros or restaurants. Some psychological pricing relies on the fact that the average person has a tenuous grasp of math. Innumeracy (think illiteracy for numbers) is when someone has a lower skill level at math than is necessary to understand the difference between two numbers. The classic example is when confronted with two sales, one stating “buy one get one free” and the other “50% off when you buy two items”, consumers think the former is a better deal than the latter. While I’m sure every reader of this piece immediately saw those two sales are identical in volume and price, what if it were “buy two, get one free” vs. “30% off”? How about “buy one, get one half off” vs. “20% off”? The fact is, most people would need a few seconds to figure it out and might not take the time to decide. This can be combined with artificial time constraints by making all of the sales practically the same final result but attractive to different people. The way prices are presented can have a tremendous effect on the perceived cost of a product. Restaurants will use slightly smaller fonts for the price than the associated description to make the price appear slightly shorter, and therefore a smaller number. You might have been in a store recently that uses a different color scheme for sale prices. For example, the normal prices are in black and white while the sales prices are in red and yellow. This naturally draws the eye to the sale items—which are precisely the items the store wants to sell you. Look closely at some of the sales too. Sometimes the flipped around regular price is the same or just slightly higher: regularly $8.99, now on for $8.96.Finally, sometimes the cents are much smaller than the dollars to really drive people to think $8 when they see $8.99.If you’re looking for a smarter way to measure the effect of a new pricing strategy, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Have a look at the demo to see how Baremetrics can show you the results of your pricing decisions.All pricing strategies come with their advantages and disadvantages, and psychological pricing is no different. Most patrons aren’t going to care if you charge $99 instead of $100, and they probably won’t consciously notice if you shave a half point off the font size, but going beyond that can really upset people. Especially in SaaS, you want to nurture the relationship you have with each subscriber so leaning too far into the psychological pricing model could be trading a small short-term gain for a loss of consistent long-term revenue.Let’s take a look at some of the specific pros and cons of psychological pricing.By offering constant sales promotions, you can expect to get more attention than usual. If you rotate among a few different sales promotions throughout the month that are effectively the same price but using different phrasing, for example “20% off” one week and then “Get three free months when you sign up for your first full year” the next week, you can expect to drive more customers to the sign-up page.One of the great advantages of psychological pricing is that it helps customers make decisions. For example, if you have a three-tier pricing scheme on your subscription site, then, by creating a “10% off” sale for the cheapest tier, “20% off” for the middle tier, and “30% off” for the most expensive tier, customers immediately see the added value of the top tier and it reduces their mental burden.If done correctly, all those psychological pricing tricks can add up to a higher return. Even if the prices are discounted more than you’d like, the added volume of a really successful sales campaign can add up to more money in the bank. FOMO is real. This is coming from a board gamer who spends too much time and money on Kickstarter. (I actually ordered something in the middle of writing this… there was only 16 hours left!) If you can build that sense of urgency, while not overplaying it to the point it is no longer believable, then you can get people to make a purchase today instead of some day. This is really the first, second, and third biggest disadvantages all in one. At its core, psychological pricing is preying on the fact that humans have evolutionary shortcomings in this high-paced modern world. While some of these tactics are so normalized as to be assumed, others are fresh, more powerful, and generally hated by anyone who notices them. While running a campaign at the end of a quarter to meet your newest MRR target might not gain the ire of your client base, doing so constantly is bound to get people angry.While having a “biggest sale ever” every day might induce FOMO in some potential customers, others might see it as an indication that your company is not doing very well—and therefore your service is probably not very good.The way you price your service and the tactics you use to drive conversions can work both ways. You don’t want the psychology of your pricing scheme to backfire.Ultimately, psychological pricing is best used sparingly when you want to hit a specific short-term sales target. In the long run, building a relationship through trust and honesty with your clients is how you can maximize their LTV.Baremetrics is the obvious choice for SaaS businesses seeking to better track their revenue while making major pricing strategy changes.If you’re looking for a smarter way to approach your SaaS business’s revenue performance, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Marketing channels are only as good as their results.

      "What Are Liabilities in SaaS?.\n",
      "A liability is a financial or legal obligation or debt that a person or company owes to another party. Liabilities are settled through the transfer of funds, goods, or services to the party to which they’re owed.In layman’s terms, if you owe someone else money and haven’t yet paid them, that’s a liability.Unlike assets, which add value to a company, liabilities decrease value and equity.Baremetrics is a business metrics monitoring tool that acts as a dashboard for your business. You can see MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly on your Baremetrics dashboard. Check out the demo account here.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.Liabilities are classified into three categories: short-term, long-term, and contingent liabilities.Let’s explore each in more detail:Short-term liabilities (also known as current liabilities) are debts or obligations that must be paid within a 12-month period.Examples of short-term liabilities include:Accounts and billsInterest payableShort-term loansBank overdraftsIncome taxes payableAny accrued expensesIf you’re running a business, you should keep an eye on your short-term debt and ensure that your current assets give you the liquidity you need to meet your obligations and debts.Long-term liabilities (also known as non-current liabilities) are obligations or debts that are due in more than one year’s time.Businesses assume long-term debt to access the funds they need for CAPEX projects or to acquire assets. If a company isn’t able to pay back its long-term liabilities when they’re due, it could threaten its solvency and overall viability.Here are some examples of long-term liabilities:MortgagesCapital leasesBonds payableLong-term notes payableAny deferred tax liabilitiesContingent liabilities are liabilities that may occur, depending on how a yet-to-be-determined future event plays out. This makes them potential liabilities.Examples of contingent liabilities include lawsuits and product warranties.In the world of accounting, “liabilities” represent the debts that are recorded in a company’s books. It’s important for any business owner to understand how to identify and record them.Liabilities must be recorded on a business’s balance sheet, which is divided into three sections:An assets section, which is an indication of how much you have.An equity section, which reflects the amount that the owner(s) or other investors have invested in the company at a point in time.A liabilities section, which indicates what the business owes.A company’s total liabilities must be equal to the difference between its total assets and its total equity:Assets = liabilities + equityLiabilities = assets – equityNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s take a closer look at liabilities in the context of SaaS companies.Establishing and bringing a SaaS company to market isn’t as expensive as it used to be – but it still costs money!Provided that a company has a sound business and financial plan and expects to get a reasonable and scalable return on new investments, it makes sense to generate liabilities. It’s well-accepted in business circles that “good debt” can be a positive thing. But business owners should ensure that they allocate capital to initiatives that pay off. If they don’t, they’ll find it difficult to service their debt.Banks are sometimes reluctant to offer loans to emerging SaaS companies because many don’t yet have any physical assets to collateralize the loan or aren’t yet profitable.Fortunately, more recently, “alternative” lenders have started recognizing the potential inherent in SaaS companies and that they have a lot more debt capacity than traditionally thought. These lenders will typically look at a SaaS business’s recurring revenue streams, churn rate, gross margins, and any outstanding liabilities when deciding whether or not they qualify for debt.If you consider borrowing to fund and grow your SaaS venture, be sure to understand precisely how your loans work. Better still, ask for assistance in doing some financial modeling.Aside from borrowing-related debt, there are other liabilities specific to SaaS that are important to understand. Many of these are directly related to the SaaS business model.In days gone by, if a business wanted to access and use software, it meant corporate licenses and on-premises installations. But the advent of SaaS turned this model on its head, giving companies and even single users a means to use the software they want, when they want it, with a credit card and a few clicks in their browsers. In addition, the consumption-based “pay-per-use” model of SaaS makes this possible at a very attractive price point.Given the asset-light, “out-of-the-box” characteristics of SaaS, it’s easy to assume that building and sustaining a profitable SaaS enterprise is straightforward. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.Here’s why:Businesses that offer a traditional license model typically issue their customers standard invoices that include an initial license, implementation and customization fees, and maintenance and support charges. However, SaaS businesses bundle all these charges into their subscription (and sometimes) set-up fees.Ultimately, the success of a SaaS business depends on how many customers decide to use its products on a recurring basis.If customers decide not to renew or to cancel their subscriptions (a term known in the industry as “churn”), revenue and overall profitability can take a knock. And even if subscription payments are scheduled and automated, customer payments are sometimes unsuccessful if their credit cards have expired or there are insufficient funds in their accounts.When this happens, the SaaS company has to invest time and resources in contacting the customer to attempt to recover the payment. If this proves unsuccessful or the customer is unresponsive, the SaaS company may decide to initiate debt collection procedures, which can themselves be costly.Tracking liabilities in SaaS can be tricky, given the nuances of the subscription business model we’ve outlined above. But, if SaaS companies are disciplined about monitoring a few key metrics, they’ll be able to keep a close eye on their liabilities and take action before they grow disproportionately.Here are a few of the most important metrics for SaaS businesses to track and how Baremetrics can help:Baremetrics lets you see all your revenue and liabilities in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can also forecast into the future and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Here are some of the metrics that our platform allows you to track at a granular level:Active customers are users who are currently paying to use your product (excluding anyone who is on a free trial or plan or is delinquent.) Baremetrics allows you to track how your number of active customers grows over time.MRR is the revenue you earn from customers on a monthly basis. If you regularly track and analyze your MRR, you’ll gain a snapshot of the overall health of your business. To find out how you can calculate your MRR in Baremetrics, check out our blog post about MRR or try out our tool for free.ARR is your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) annualized. It gives you an idea of how much revenue you can expect to bring in over a year, based on your current MRR. Understanding your ARR is helpful when contemplating your growth and expansion plans. Learn more about ARR.This is the average amount of revenue that you receive from each active customer over a period of a month. It’s important to calculate your ARPU on active customers rather than your total number of users.As we mentioned earlier, churn is the percentage of customers or the revenue you lose over a certain period. If you struggle to keep your churn under control, it’ll impact your revenues and your longer-term viability. Learn more about churn analysis in our 3-step guide.LTV is an estimate of the revenue you can expect to make from the average customer before they churn. SaaS companies use LTV to calculate how much they should reasonably invest in acquiring a new customer. Baremetrics allows you to track your LTV over time and analyze the LTV for specific customers.Baremetrics also lets you segment your customers in multiple ways, for example:This allows you to become more focused in your account-based marketing efforts.

      "What Customer Events are Tracked in Baremetrics?.\n",
      "In addition to calculating subscription data and metrics, Baremetrics also monitors important customer events like upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and more. With Baremetrics, it’s never been easier to know your customer’s history with your business. This article explains the customer events we track,  and how you can view them in Baremetrics and Slack. The Baremetrics Control Center features essential metrics, as well as a breakdown and live stream of customer events. Don’t worry, these aren’t real customer names. The numbers, though, are totally real. Check out our Live Demo!Let’s discuss each event in a little more detail. New customers are customers who either signed up or converted from a free trial. Upgrades are customers who have upgraded from one paid plan to a more expensive paid plan. Switches are customers who have changed plans. In the case of a customer moving from one plan to a less expensive plan, the switch will be considered a downgrade. Keep reading for more information about downgrades in Baremetrics. Charges are payments your customers have made. Hooray! Failed charges are counted when your payment provider attempts a charge and is not successful.Failed charges are usually the result of credit cards with unresolved issues. These issues include: Incorrect card informationExpired or maxed outReported as lost or stolenFailed charges can lead to churn and dramatically impact your business’s MRR. Fortunately, you can get ahead of failed charges and beat churn with tools like Recover by Baremetrics. Start a free trial today. Downgrades are folks who are still customers, but are paying you less money on a monthly basis than they did previously. Here’s an example of a downgrade:Many SaaS companies offer a discount for moving to an annual plan. Because the average monthly amount of an annual plan is lower, this is considered a downgrade (though in the grand scheme of things, a great thing for retention).Refunds are cash amounts that you’ve returned to customers. We don’t expect refunds to be recurring, so these values do not alter your MRR.Baremetrics integrates with Slack to bring you updates within the Slack app. After connecting your Baremetrics and Slack accounts, simply choose which metrics you want updates on, and how often you want to see them.And if you want to retrieve specific Baremetrics data without leaving Slack, you can do so with the command: /baremetrics [interval] [metric]Interval refers to the duration of time (daily, weekly, monthly). Metric is any of the 26+ metrics we track in Baremetrics Here’s what a command for a monthly report of active trials looks like!Baremetrics monitors customer events to help you keep a pulse of what’s happening in your business in real time.

      "Top 10 Pricing Strategy Examples for SaaS.\n",
      "Gone are the days where you can throw a dart to pick your starting price and work towards the correct one (okay, maybe this was never the case). While price analysis and price experimentation are the basis of price optimization, you need to start with a sound pricing strategy.The SaaS market is highly competitive, with new businesses cropping up daily and every legacy software company up to Microsoft finding ways to get their foot in the door. There is too much at stake to waste time looking for the ideal price at random.And while there is no universal way to come up with a fair price for your product—at least not one the market will respond to favorably—economists and businesspeople alike have given a lot of attention to the topic of pricing recently. While it is easy to pinpoint where the price shouldn’t be, i.e., below your long-term marginal cost or above the willingness to pay for a sufficient number of clients, it is really difficult to decide where the price should be.Thankfully, Baremetrics is here with an ongoing series about pricing strategies. While we have dealt with many key topics so far, including cost plus pricing, bundle pricing, penetration pricing, price skimming, and psychological pricing, as well as articles on price optimization and price leadership, we haven’t brought many of the different pricing strategies together into a comparative list yet.Well, here it is. In this article, we will compare 10 pricing strategy examples, such as premium pricing, promotional pricing, and competition-based pricing. We’ll take a look at these examples together with some of their common iterations and hybrid forms. Whatever pricing strategy you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data, including your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Integrating this innovative tool can make evaluating your pricing strategy seamless for your SaaS company, and you should start a free trial today.A pricing strategy is basically the methodology a company uses to come up with a price for its products. Yes, that technically does mean that throwing a dart is a pricing strategy, but let’s focus on the ones that are more likely to hit the bull’s eye (apologies to my vegan friends).These strategies typically involve some math, and it is rare to use only one strategy at a time. Indeed, the best strategies are the hybrid ones that take into account your cost structure, the demographics of your target market, the competition, and any other data you can get your hands on.Just as the Internet has made it easier for you to look up your competitor’s pricing strategies to make sure you are in line with market expectations, your customers have also become incredibly savvy with price checking. Without a sound pricing strategy, you will either be pushing customers away with unreasonably high prices or leaving money on the table by undervaluing your product. Both of these are disasters waiting to happen.Let’s take a look at some of the best pricing strategies you can invest in today to maximize your profit.If you’re looking for a smarter way to measure the effect of a new pricing strategy, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Have a look at the demo to see how Baremetrics can show you the results of your marketing decisions.While the pricing strategy examples below are a great place to start, keep in mind that each individual strategy is not going to be sufficient. The price strategy to run in a real-world application is going to be a combination of several of these that in cooperation are a tailored approach to your customer base.Furthermore, with proper experimentation and the maturing of your business, you will likely find that the strategies that work best change over time. Price skimming is founded on rather complex economics. Essentially, as you enter the market, especially with a radically new product with low to no competition, you can take more of the “consumer surplus” by pricing your product really high. The early adopters are willing to pay a lot more for your product so you can charge a higher price. Then, over time, you lower your price so that each subsequent cohort of customers pays slightly less. This is a great way to quickly recoup all those high R&D costs of your new platform.Opposite to price skimming, with penetration pricing, you aim to quickly build up a loyal customer base with much lower prices at launch. When your product is going to be one of a thousand on the market, even if we know that it is the best, most user-friendly of the bunch, it could be difficult to pull customers away from competitors. A very low initial price—so low that it can get some media attention—might get you that needed base of subscribers to build a profitable recurring revenue stream on.While penetration pricing is all about low initial prices and then raising them slowly over time, competitive pricing is all about low prices for a long period of time. While this might seem like a bad way to maximize profits, so long as these low prices aren’t below your marginal cost structure while still being low enough that your competitors are constantly losing clients to you, then the market will slowly shift towards you and your “low prices” won’t actually be all that low anymore.For example, Walmart comes to town and kills the local competition with massively low prices, and then once all the shops downtown are gone, raises prices to a point still lower than any remaining competition but well above the previous average prices in the town.This is all about pricing to imply your quality. If your customers are interested in high quality, then having higher, premium prices can actually be a signal to your high quality and lead to even more sales. Be sure to back up your premium prices with premium products and services though!A loss leader is essentially a single product placed on a deep discount to get people in the door buying everything else in sight. To go back to Walmart, their loss leader would be a heavily discounted big screen TV that gets you in the door buying everything in sight (at regular prices even if marked with a red sale tag) on Black Friday.Psychological pricing is any pricing strategy designed to get people thinking about a purchase emotionally instead of logically. For example, many studies have shown that consumers ignore pennies when making a purchase so $4.99 and $4 “feel” like the same price. Another example is using ad-copy that makes it seem like the prices will go up soon, or the product is offered for a limited time only.Be careful, though, as consumers do not like to be manipulated and relying too heavily on psychological pricing could be problematic in the long term if consumers start thinking you are dishonest.Value pricing is a strategy where your prices are based on the value consumers get out of your products. While you aren’t premium pricing (high prices based on your high quality) or economy pricing (low prices based on a basic product level), value pricing is about the consumers feeling they are getting good “value for money”.If you can understand your customers’ needs, wants, motivations, and pain points, then you can position your product as reasonably priced based on the value it adds to their organization.Bundle pricing is the staple system of the SaaS enterprise. You offer a bundle of related products for a single price that is lower than the price your customer would pay for all the products separately. This can work with a tiered pricing model, where each tier is a separate bundle.Economy pricing is the opposite of premium pricing. This pricing strategy is based around being the basic model for a low price. Unlike a bundle which has everything the consumer needs, wants, doesn’t need, and doesn’t want combined, the economy pricing strategy stipulates that you only offer the bare minimum needed product or service for the lowest possible price.Promotional pricing is another competitive pricing strategy. For example, you can offer discount codes to potential customers. The goal is to entice buyers to make a purchase today.This list is not even close to exhaustive. There’s also geographical pricing, captive pricing, dynamic price, odd-even pricing, and a whole lot more—not to mention all the various hybrid and derivative approaches. Indeed, the only real-world pricing strategies are hybrids of these one-dimensional examples. With your price point being so important, it is no wonder that there are hundreds of ways to come up with an appropriate price, not to mention the main ways to run price experiments as well. Baremetrics is the obvious choice for SaaS businesses seeking to better track their revenue while making major pricing strategy changes.If you’re looking for a smarter way to approach your SaaS business’s revenue performance, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today.Marketing channels are only as good as their results.

      "Best Payment Processors for Startups.\n",
      "Currency, as well as how it is used for financial transactions, has evolved considerably over time – and it has only accelerated in recent years.While coins have been around for thousands of years, the notion of paper money only arrived in the West in the 1600s (about 700 years after it was invented in China). It wasn’t until the 1960s that you could take notes from an ATM, which is when automation really started to take off in the banking sector.In 1994, a CD was sold on a website called NetMarket marking the first official Internet purchase (although there are rumours that students at MIT and Stanford were using the Internet to sell marijuana from the 1970s…).The story of payment processors begins in 1998 when Confinity (later X.com, but you probably know it as PayPal) was released. This early payment processor did very little and wasn’t all that important to global commerce.But with the rise of ecommerce, the adoption of credit card companies, new digital wallets and apps, payment software and gateways, and even cryptocurrencies, payment processing has become big business and the payment processors an indispensable part of the global economy.That history might be interesting to some, but the real questions are:Well stick around, and let’s see if we can answer these questions and more.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start getting the most out of your payment gateways.A payment processor is a third-party company chosen by a merchant to handle transactions from various payment channels, such as credit card and debit cards.There are two basic types of payment processors: front-end and back-end.Front-end processors are connected to various card associations and provide authorization and settlement services to the merchant banks’ merchants.Back-end processors take the settlements from front-end processors and, using, e.g., the Federal Reserve Bank, move the money from the issuing bank to the merchant bank.In providing this service, payment processors take the information from the purchaser, verify it, and use the information to gauge the probability of the transaction being improved. This includes various anti-fraud measures.The payment processor relays via the payment gateway all of this information to the merchant, who will then either complete the transaction or deny the transaction based on the results of the verification.Let’s take a look at the two other essential parts of the payment process to make things a bit clearer: payment gateways and merchant accounts.While payment processors are a huge part of the online payment ecosystem, they are not the only component that matters. There are also the payment gateways and merchant accounts.The payment gateway works as a middleman between the payment processor and credit card company as well as between the merchant and credit card company.It performs all the technical work of transferring credit card information securely. The payment gateway is an essential component of every transaction so without one commerce cannot take place.A merchant account is a special bank account that can accept credit card and debit card payments. Payments sit here for a defined period of time before being transferred to a company’s bank account. When setting up your business, you will need a merchant account to be able to accept payments.Whatever payment gateways or processors you choose, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. Your SaaS company likely uses a CRM in addition to payment processing software, and the data required to compute your core revenue metrics can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut. Baremetrics can do this all for you.Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.The modern payment ecosystem is a lot more confusing than passing around metal coins, with payment gateways, payment processors, merchant accounts, credit card companies, and all their tasks designed to confirm the legitimacy and legality of the transactions.Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the end-to-end process:The customer opens their shopping card, clicks checkout, selects to pay by credit card, and submits their credit card info.The merchant sends the financial information, including the cardholder details, to the payment gateway.After receiving the transaction details, the payment gateway further sends the information to the third-party payment processor used by the merchant.The payment processor sends the transaction information to the card network (e.g., MasterCard or Visa).The card network next sends the transaction information to the customer’s bank, which checks whether the customer has the credit limit space available to complete the purchase.The bank then sends their response to the card network, i.e. whether the transaction has been approved or declined.This response is then relayed by the card network to the payment processor and then by the payment processor to the payment gateway, which informs the merchant and customer of the response.Finally, assuming the transaction has been approved, the funds are deposited by the customer’s bank into the merchant account, where they must sit for an agreed upon period of time before being paid into the business’s bank account.There are many payment processors out there, and sometimes it feels like they are all the same. In addition to the obvious things—price and price structure (percentage and/or per transaction fees), throughput (how many transactions per minute they can handle), needed features (ability to automate your recurring subscription revenue), and usability (how easy it is for you and your customers to process payments)—here are a couple key factors you should confirm:Compatibility: You probably use a shopfront, payment gateways, and software to collect and analyze your sales data, so you should be finding a payment processor compatible with all of these other key tools.PCI compliance: Credit card information needs to be stored and transferred securely so look for a PCI-compliant payment processor.Fraud: Fraud is rampant, and you need a payment processor that will perform multiple different fraud checks to reduce the chances of payments being refunded and the lost revenue that entails.Customer base: Some payment processors have amassed a huge number of monthly users, and these users may be more inclined to use your service if they can use the payment processors they trust.While this list is by no means exhaustive, here are some of the payment processors available. They range from newer to long established, famous to less well known.2Checkout has provided mobile and desktop-based payment services in 196 countries for over 15 years. This PCI-compliant platform can process credit cards, debit cards, and even PayPal payments. It has low transaction fees as well as no recurring monthly or setup fees.Payline Data offers good anti-fraud solutions, among many other tools, and it can be used on smartphones as well as websites and ecommerce shops.GoCardless can be set up easily and provides automated payment tracking. They are also cheaper than PayPal.Paynova offers 21 payment options. Paynova is best suited for startups and small ecommerce businesses.PayPal offers customers convenient digital wallets, among other services. This provides PayPal with over 300 million active users.Its transparent pricing and simple setup make it an obvious choice for many business owners.All of the Internet giants are getting into the payment processing space. These companies have the infrastructure to power even the busiest sites and come with built in customer bases that could help drive more sales.The convenience and perceived security of a big brand name make customers confident that they can shop easily and securely using these systems.Similar to PayPal, often the higher fees come with increased sales volume.Stripe is often considered the most convenient for SaaS businesses because it comes with loads of features specific to the market. You can take a look at our article comparing Stripe to PayPal to see why.For example, Stripe allows you to save all of the credit card information to make returning customers easier to process. Stripe also has the option for automated payments, which is crucial for recurring revenue.Whatever payment processor you choose, be sure that it works with your analytics tools. If you aren’t utilizing your sales data, then you aren’t getting the most out of your payment processor.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "Marginal Cost: Why You Need to Know It.\n",
      "Marginal cost is essentially the cost of producing one more unit, whether a product or service. When looking at the income statement, there are two separate types of expenses. On the one hand, you have fixed costs. These are usually large expenses that do not change based on the number of units you produce. On the other hand, you have variable costs. These expenses are tied to the units of production and usually found under the cost of goods sold (COGS).When dealing with unit economics, it is important to understand the differences between fixed and variable expenses and how they combine to make up your marginal cost. If you don’t know your marginal costs, then it is impossible to efficiently price your product or service.For a SaaS business, costs are thought about differently, considering mostly the CAC (customer acquisition cost) and ACS (average cost of service), which makes things trickier, but the basic idea is the same. In this article, we go through how to calculate marginal cost, why it is important, where it is used, and then give a couple of examples of marginal cost calculations, including one using the CAC and ACS paradigm.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.The marginal cost is the cost to produce each additional unit of production. For example, if a company has $10,000 in fixed costs, while the variable costs of each unit is $10, then the marginal cost of the first unit is $10,010, while the marginal cost of Unit 2 and onwards is $10 until the production volume becomes so large as to put pressure on the equipment collected under fixed costs, requiring major upgrades. This is in contrast to the unit cost, which is the average cost per unit. In this same example, the unit cost when producing one product is $10,010, but then it drops to $5,010 when two units are produced. Both values are important for budgeting, pricing, major capital expansion plans, etc., but be careful not to confuse them. Furthermore, it is important to differentiate the short-run marginal cost from the long-run marginal cost. In this case, “short run” refers to a time horizon over which some costs are fixed, whereas the “long run” refers to a sufficiently long period that there are no fixed costs.The short-run marginal cost refers to the basic marginal cost discussed throughout this article. It is a situation in which some costs are fixed while others are variable. For example, a company may own expensive equipment or a building which cannot be sold or replaced reasonably over a period of time. Thus, these expenses are fixed. The chart below shows the short-run marginal cost (SMC) as a U-shaped curve with the quantity on the x-axis and the cost per unit on the y-axis.Since some costs are fixed, there is usually part of the curve on the left where the marginal cost is very high due to an inefficiently low quantity of production. Then, with economies of scale, the marginal cost of production reaches a minimum as the quantity increases. However, without enough time to replace, upgrade, or sell fixed costs to react to an even larger volume, eventually the economies of scale reverse and the marginal cost goes up with increased production volume. The long run here is defined as the length of time during which no inputs are fixed. Thus, even buildings or equipment can be replaced. While the U-shaped chart above is fairly commonly seen for short-run marginal cost, there is no such predictable chart for long-run marginal cost.It is possible that, in the long run, economies of scale continue to decrease the marginal cost, or it may remain constant or increase with scale. Furthermore, technology or management changes could have drastic positive or negative effects on the long-run marginal cost. Monitor your subscription revenue accuratelyThe marginal cost of production is used to optimize production levels. Having a strong understanding of how costs change unit by unit gives companies the information they need to pick the production level that matches their goals.Expanding production too quickly or too slowly can harm the bottom line. More importantly, for those companies operating in a competitive market, it tells you exactly when to stop producing more units.The marginal cost pricing strategy basically stipulates that, when operating in a competitive market, to maximize profit, a company should produce units until their short-run marginal cost is equal to their price or, vice versa, price their product at their marginal cost.Marginal cost is calculated by dividing the change in costs by the change in quantity. While above an example was given of the marginal cost of the next unit, you can also think of the marginal cost of producing the next set of units, which is often more practical. Nabisco doesn’t produce one Oreo at a time, but rather an entire production run is the basic unit of increment.Taking the example above, if the fixed costs are $10,000 and the variables costs are $10/unit, assuming a production decision is based on 100 units, then the marginal cost of units 101 to 202 is $1,000/100 = $10, whereas the marginal cost of units 1 to 100 is $11,000/100 = $110.Formally, the marginal cost formula is as follows:The change in total cost is the difference between the total cost before the considered production run and the total cost after the production run. In the above example, after 100 units, the total cost is $11,000, while it is $12,000 after 200 units. If we are looking at the second set of units, then $12,000 – $11,000 leaves us at $1,000 for the change in costs.The change in quantity is similar. It is the difference between the total quantity produced before the considered production run and the total quantity produced after the production run. In the case above, we have 100 units produced and then 200 produced. Therefore, for the second production run, the change in quantity is 200 – 100, which is 100.While the ongoing example is pretty simple, getting all the data together to figure out the marginal cost is rarely so simple in reality. Let’s look at a couple more complicated examples to get a better idea of what all of this entails. In January, you spend $500 setting up a small online shop. It costs $100 per month to host the shop. In the shop, you sell picture frames that cost $3 to make and ship to the customer. In the first half of the year, you sell 1000 picture frames. By the end of July, you have sold 1300 total frames. What is the marginal cost of the frames sold in July?First, the change in quantity is: 1300 – 1000 = 300.Second, the cost of the frames sold from January to June is: $500 + ($100 × 6) + ($3 × 1000) = $500 + $600 + $3000 = $4,100.The total cost of the frames is: $500 + ($100 × 7) + ($3 × 1300) = $500 + $700 + $3,900 = $5,100.The change in the cost is: $5,100 – $4,100 = $1000.Third, the marginal cost is: $1000/300 = $3.33.For this example, we are going to consider a unit one month of a subscription. For your company, the CAC (customer acquisition cost) is $500, while the ASC is $20/month. The ASC includes everything from the amortized R&D expenses to the cost of hosting and maintaining your platform. What is the marginal cost of the first and second month? First, the change in quantity for the first month is 1 – 0 = 1, while that of the second month is 2 – 1 = 1. That’s pretty simple.Second, the total cost before Month 1 is $0, before Month 2 is $500 + $20 = $520, and before Month 3 is $500 + ($20 × 2) = $540.Therefore, the change in total cost for the first month is $520 – 0 = $520, while it is $540 – $520 = $20 for the second month. Third, the marginal cost of the first month is $520/1 = $520, while the marginal cost of the second month is $20/1 = $20. While this summary gives you an idea of how to calculate the marginal cost in a SaaS subscription business, figuring out how to amortize your R&D over the lifetime of all your customers—not to mention matching all the other expenses to those units—is not easy!That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data.

      "SaaS Financial Metrics: Use Baremetrics for All of Your SaaS Financial Metrics.\n",
      "There might not be an industry more addicted to its metrics than SaaS, and there is good reason for it. Coming from data and engineering backgrounds, most SaaS founders know that good decisions require good data, and great decisions require as much good data as you can find.But how many SaaS financial metrics are you really tracking? Most SaaS companies keep an eye on churn, but do you calculate both revenue churn and customer churn? Most SaaS companies keep track of their customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer lifetime value (LTV), but how about your CAC:LTV ratio or months to recover CAC?While the amount of incremental value you get out of each SaaS financial metric is variable, having all of them at your fingertips is one of the keys to success, which is why we are going through all of the SaaS financial metrics in this article.If you had to calculate them all on your own, you wouldn’t have time to do anything else. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics does all the heavy lifting for you, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. The crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your revenue, expenses, and profit for a specified period. This allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.Baremetrics gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Metrics are all the little mathematical shortcuts you can take to get a good idea of how your business is doing. While collecting and pulling the data to calculate metrics isn’t easy, the metrics themselves are usually based on some pretty simple and logical math. That’s one of the things that make them so powerful. By boiling down some difficult questions about the health of your business to a number, you can get some insight into how you are doing at the moment or how your situation is changing over time.For example, if you are worried about the cash flow of your business over the next few months, a quick look at your current ratio or quick ratio will tell you if things are all right or you have something to be genuinely concerned about. While the traditional and GAAP-approved metrics are important for SaaS as well, there are always specific SaaS financial metrics for every occasion, including the SaaS quick ratio.So let’s look at the simple logic and numbers that go into many of the SaaS financial metrics, and the deep insights your company can get out of them. ARR and MRR are the bread-and-butter SaaS financial metrics. When you are earning revenue using a subscription revenue model, then you better know how much in subscription revenue you are bringing in! ARR and MRR are simply the amount of revenue you are bringing in from subscribed customers based on how much they spend per year and month, respectively.When forward looking, you need to incorporate things like your expected churn, expansion ARR/MRR, reactivation ARR/MRR, and contraction ARR/MRR based on the averages and trends you’ve been seeing recently. However, the basic calculations for current ARR/MRR are pretty easy: ARR/MRR = total number of active customers × average billed amount (over one year/month).This is the average amount a user is paying you per specified period (usually monthly). This can help you keep track of whether your customers are signing up for more services over time, an indication that you are developing services of value to your current customers.While CAC discussed below is a greater concern to most SaaS businesses, developing and running services isn’t free. If you aren’t aware of how much money you are spending getting your product to market and then running it, you are probably undercharging the real cost of your product. R&D amortization (per customer, per period), technical support, hosting, account management, and all the overhead spent to run the company must be earned back through subscription revenue, which means you need to include it in this calculation. While ACS is often overlooked, most companies are keenly aware of their CAC. Indeed, it is often one of the first questions asked by a venture capitalist when considering an investment. CAC is all of the sales and marketing expenses that go into acquiring a customer. The more comprehensive you can make this calculation—including wages, taxes, benefits, travel, meals, and any expense that can be attributed to getting visitors on your page and those visitors to sign up for your service—the better. While a short-sighted founder looking for investments might think representing their CAC as lower than reality is better, being extra conservative will help you to find the right price structure to garner long-term success. Do you know how long you need to keep a customer happy to pay off your CAC? Sometimes referred to as months to recover CAC, the CAC payback period tells you when your customers begin generating a true benefit to your company. If your ARPU is $100/month and your CAC is $400, then your months to recover CAC is 4. However, if your ACS is $50/month, then your months to recover CAC is really 8 because not all of that revenue can be dedicated to paying off the clients CAC debt.The LTV can be calculated in many different ways, based on many different assumptions, but in essence it is the average amount billed monthly × the average number of months a client uses your service before churning. How you calculate the average amount billed monthly can vary from a straight line of their current plan to one that includes increments based on your expected expansion MRR.The LTV can take into account your ACS and/or CAC or be a straight revenue figure. You can use complex statistics to build a probability function around your churn numbers or just use the median duration of a contract based on your churn. Each of these decisions will bring a different perspective, and calculating multiple LTV values is a practical way to avoid it being misleading. As far as SaaS financial metrics are concerned, few give as much information as this simple ratio. By taking a strict revenue version of LTV (or one that includes ACS but not CAC) and comparing it to your CAC, you can see how many times over your average customers pay for themselves. While churn is one of the most rudimentary SaaS financial metrics, most companies fail to measure it based on both customers and revenue. Since not all customers are equal, these metrics give you something different. For example, if you double the price of your service and lose 25% of your customers, then your customer churn value looks terrible, but your monthly revenue has actually gone up 50%. In fact, you might find this the best decision you have ever made as the customers that churned are likely the ones that didn’t understand the value they were getting from your service and therefore complaining constantly.This is the percentage of customers that churned over a given period of time. Knowing this value is the first step to reducing your churn.Similarly, this is the amount of revenue that churned over a given period of time.This is the opposite of customer churn. If 5% of customers do not renew each month, then your customer churn is 5% while your CRR is 95%.While this isn’t precisely a SaaS financial metric, your marketing and sales managers will be telling (or yelling if need be) that it is as important as all the financial metrics.Expressed as a percentage, it tells you how well your marketing and sales strategies are doing. Depending on the company, it can be based on the number of visitors to your page, the number of visitors who click through to your “sign up now” page, or the number of people who sign up for your free trial, but whatever you divide it by, the top number is paid sign ups. For example, if for every 1000 visitors to your page, 500 click through to the sign up page, 100 do a free trial, and 10 sign up, then your marketing manager might consider this number 1% or 2% based on visitors to the blog and how they interact, while the sales manager might consider it 10% based on how well their tutorial, free trial, and follow up communications work.While some might call these barely metrics, sometimes simple integers can give you a lot of value—especially if you track them month on month.This tells you the number of customers that canceled and then came back.This is the number of customers that increased the amount they spend monthly.This is the number of customers that decreased the amount they spend monthly.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "What is Equity Financing?.\n",
      "Equity financing is a method of capital raising via the selling of stock. Businesses grow money for a variety of reasons. They may need cash to meet immediate financial obligations or have a longer-term objective and require capital to invest in their development. By selling shares, a business essentially sells its ownership in exchange for cash.Equity funding may originate from various sources, including friends and relatives of the entrepreneur, financiers, or an initial public offering (IPO). An initial public offering (IPO) is how private businesses sell shares of their company to the public in a new stock issuance. Public share offering enables a business to obtain money from the general public. Industry titans such as Google and Facebook raised billions of dollars via initial public offerings.While the phrase \"equity financing\" is often used to refer to the funding of publicly traded businesses, the term is also applied to private company financing.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.SaaS equity financing is the process of acquiring money in return for a stake in a business. When it comes to equity financing, various options are available, including funding from high-net-worth individuals, a venture capital firm (investment in a company with the potential for long-term growth), or private equity (investment in a business that is not publicly listed).The amount of ownership provided to an investor is decided by the stage of business investment (series A, B, etc.). Also, it depends upon the firm's success and the amount of money that the company is looking to acquire.SaaS equity financing is usually sought after a business has operated for a while and established a solid foundation as this affects their overall equity. Typically, the critical components of this foundation are monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or annual recurring revenue (ARR). Another financial factor to examine is the amount of churn a business suffers every month as this reflects the company's capacity to develop and retain connections — or to lose them. It is ideal to have a low churn rate and a high MRR/ARR.Equity financing is usually not considered by a business seeking capital to remain afloat early in its life cycle as the investment is considerably more significant. Additionally, getting SaaS equity financing is much slower, often taking six months or more. This is usually where venture debt funding comes into play, loan-based financing returned via earnings or another kind of monthly payment. Debt financing is preferable for sales and marketing acceleration since it has a lower long-term cost and enables the company to expand quicker.When a business wants to obtain money, it may choose from various financing options: equity financing, debt financing, and venture capital funding.While equity financing imposes no extra financial strain on the business, the drawback is very significant. The primary benefit of equity financing is no obligation to return the funds raised.Debt financing requires borrowing money. The primary benefit of debt financing is that the company owner keeps complete control of the enterprise, unlike equity financing. Creditors prefer a low debt-to-equity ratio, which helps the business if it ever requires more debt funding.Venture capital funds invest in high-growth prospects in startups and other early-stage companies on a pooled basis. Hedge funds invest in high-growth, high-risk businesses. Consequently, they are accessible only to experienced investors who can tolerate risk, illiquidity, and lengthy investment horizons. Venture capital funds provide seed money or \"venture capital\" to new businesses seeking rapid development, most often in high-tech or developing sectors.When you need a stable funding source with no required dividend payments and retained earnings, you should consider equity financing.Each of these will be described in-depth:Equity finance is the long-term answer to a business's financial requirements. No business's primary emphasis or goal can be just financial management. A product manufacturing company's goal will be to produce high-quality products and to reach the appropriate customer. A service provider business will guarantee that the services it provides are of the highest quality. Equity financing gives management the leverage necessary to maintain a laser-like focus on their primary goals. It frees management from the difficulties associated with obtaining money repeatedly, as with other forms of funding, such as debt. Debt is acquired and repaid over time.Equity financing for a new business is similar to receiving divine gifts. The primary constraint for a startup business is the unpredictability of financial flows. Due to the absence of a set duty to pay dividends, the equity financing method provides breathing room for management. A business may opt to pay no dividends or pay them at a reduced rate depending on its cash flow situation.By bringing equity financing on board, a business may create an internal source of funding. Earnings generated by a business utilizing capital can be maintained to cover increasing working capital and other financial needs. It eliminates the additional complications associated with obtaining money from other sources. Additionally, if the funds are invested in initiatives that provide greater returns than those accessible to equity owners, the firm accomplishes its goal of maximizing shareholder wealth.An offering of equity financing does not always imply approval of your business model. Businesses that fall into specific attractive categories have a simpler way of acquiring funding—even if the money is unsuitable for their company.This section explains two distinct developmental pathways and how entrepreneurs can determine if equity financing will benefit or hurt their company in the long run. The two pathways are:Businesses continue to expand sustainably and intentionally through non-dilutive capital and reinvestment of income from paying consumers.They are given venture money, give up a significant amount of stock, and make an exponential growth risk.Those who follow the first route will likely see consistent and predictable development, eventually resulting in an exit.Those who choose the second choice face a far more risky future with a 75% failure rate—and no plan B or alternative result.Typically, they take venture capital and celebrate it in the same way that most companies do. They modify their steady, sustainable development plans to meet the venture capital firm's expectations and expand quickly. They increase recruiting, spend in sales and marketing, and then sit back and watch their revenue grow.If revenue growth does not materialize at a suitable rate, it becomes simpler to see the foundation's flaws. Eventually, the entrepreneur is compelled to sell, debt and venture investors are compensated, and ordinary shareholders often get nothing.The reason things may go wrong is that money alone cannot address all of a startup's problems; it can even worsen them.To determine if your company would profit from equity financing, follow these three steps:Conduct an honest evaluation of your business's development potential.Determine if your issue is one of customer acquisition or market size.Examine the underlying indicators to determine whether you need to spend more money.The financial indicators that you want to track for your organization are industry and business-specific. Metrics relating to assets such as equipment and logistics will be important for heavy industrial companies. Not so much for SaaS.You'll need to create a unique financial model for each company that outlines precisely the KPIs you're focused on. Consider this financial model for SaaS, which you can download and use straight in Sheets. Baremetrics interfaces with Google Sheets, making it simple to feed data directly into your financial model.Furthermore, the names and definitions of metrics vary per industry. For instance, the Quick Ratio is used to compare the assets and liabilities of a brick and mortar commodities business. The Quick Ratio has a different meaning in SaaS. The SaaS Quick Ratio compares growth in MRR due to new customers, expansions, or reactivations against churn losses.Each product or tool will uniquely gather data about your metrics. It is up to the analyst to choose a tool compatible with the manner their measurements will be measured. When tracking financial KPIs for a SaaS business, it's critical to concentrate on the fundamentals. Then, you must focus on performing the fundamental measures properly.Every company should begin with these measures as their primary set of financial measurements and add supplementary computations. Baremetrics offers a variety of financial metrics that can help a SAAS company grow.The financial measures include the following:Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)Annual Run Rate (ARR)Net Revenue MRR Growth Rate Other Revenue  Quick RatioActive SubscriptionsNew SubscriptionsPlan Quantities UpgradesDowngrades Failed ChargesRefundsCoupons Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)Lifetime Value (LTV)New CustomersActive Customers Churned CustomersReactivationsUser Churn Revenue ChurnNet Revenue ChurnChurned SubscriptionsIf you want to get these metrics without running any calculations in your own Google Sheets, join up for Baremetrics here.

      "Mental Health for Entrepreneurs and Everybody Else.\n",
      "A while ago on Quora I read an answer to a question discussing a syndrome called \"the Duck Syndrome\" which refers to severely stressed college students at prominent universities, they might look cool and coherent to the naked eye (just like a perfectly still duck in a pond) but inside the realms of their own being, they are continuously struggling, trying miserably to catch up with the massive amount of studying required (just like a hecticly pedaling duck, trying to maintain swimming forward).Put differently, they might be conforming perfectly to relentless standards of academic performance yet their mental health is taking an acute hit, making it astoundingly difficult to experience mindfulness, which, I believe, is truly important.I’ve a visceral personal experience with declining mental health, it is never helpful. Even when it is compromised for the noble aim of helping my own business experience accelerated growth, it, sarcastically, leads to the exact opposite: a paralyzing burn out that coerces me into resting so I can regain the strength to resume carrying out my responsibilities.   And for these stifling burn outs I am forever thankful because they are a stern reminder of my human abilities, they act as a consequence to my sometimes mad working sprees that are fueled by a heated desire to achieve more with blatant disregard to my stress thresholds and my intrinsic need for self-care.So, as counterproductive as it usually sounds, less is more even in the unforgiving world of entrepreneurship that is intimately associated with human Gods who magically grow Unicorns, achieve unprecedented greatness and still look surprisingly coherent to the naked eye, whereas the truth is, greatness is achieved by steady perseverance and remarkable patience and that is the hardest part. If success is a linear process of speed from point A to point B, the drop off rate of those who decide to cease trying would have been dramatically less.If what you’ve read so far struck a chord because maybe protecting your mental health is challenging for you as well, the next couple of paragraphs might provide some insights on how you can keep things going at work and your personal life without compromising your mental health to the point of hard return.   Steady is boring, fast is sexy. But I’ve come to learn that boring actions are a more gentle and tinder friend to the soul. Commonly, we pursue our ambitions with deadly speed because of the implied belief that ‘’ getting there ‘’ will make us whole and not necessarily because that is what’s truly better for us; it is an involuntary fixation, the belief that our life journey’s destination is a specific, clear point that can bring about eternal happiness once reached. And we commonly term certain habits or actions ‘’ boring ‘’ because they are deficient in their sex appeal; their ability to promise instaneous gratification. But, surprisingly, boring brings about remarkable meaningfulness that our souls are usually deficient in. And while that might sound remotely relevant to leading a business, it actually isn’t. Founding a business is a thorough journey that is best lived day by day. The attractive ambition is to gloriously succeed and disrupt the market and that might and might not happen. So, whatever happens, enjoying and humbly learning from a journey marked by trial, error and growth is the authentic value that one should look for. Because the truth is, when we are ruthlessly fixated on reaching an ideal state of success to the point of helpless daydreaming while the prospect of failure even in the simplest endeavors scars the shit out of us, that might be indicating low levels of tranquility and peace that you need to address. And maybe even a turbulent sense of self-worth that you’re understandably attempting to compensate. I believe that today’s world advocates pretence. Selling perfection as a viable remedy to our troubling relationship with our imperfect nature works like magic. Marketing messaging is unequivocally effective when it promotes a product that promises a lingering state of perfection where something lasts forever, whether it is pleasure or a different emotion. I would by all means adopt the pursuit of perfection if it had no visceral consequences to mental health. Regardless of how diligently you try, you will inevitably screw up in something, in a simple email that you should have phrased differently or a feature that you should have designed differently. You will gloriously screw things up, and I’ve learnt the hard way that this is ‘’ perfectly ‘’ fine.  The much admired Dave Chappelle once shared in one of his Netflix comedy specials, ‘’ Remember, no matter how perfect somebody’s life looks from the outside, it usually is entirely different from the inside. ‘’ I say Amen to that. And I am not by any means saying that you shouldn’t relentlessly strive to the highest of standards in everything you do, however, I am advocating the acceptance of your abilities as a human which implies accepting that sometimes things will take longer than you’d like them to take, or that something has to be sacrificed for something else to happen, so, along your journey to achieve, you come to terms with how acceptance is sometimes the way to go because you’d otherwise learn nothing of meaning if everything in life paced according to your own terms.  It happens a lot to me -- starting the day with good vibes then joining this one meeting or having this call that screws up how I feel and makes me nervous. In these tense discussions, I sometimes fail to detect why I feel the way I feel so I react impulsively with anger, agitation or defensiveness that always hurts business priorities and ends the meeting with all parties feeling frustrated and upset. Does that ring a bell in any way? We all share a tendency to cope with hurtful emotions like anger, defectiveness or mistrust with behaviors that might be quite counterproductive to business discussions. I personally admit a troubling tendency to get angry easily when I am feeling heavily insecure or stuck inside my head. Someone might ask a normal question, asking why I haven’t delivered a specific task so far and I can answer in conspicuous agitation. The only way to change unhealthy coping is to grow conscious of why you feel this way, because, often, it has nothing to do with the other person and more to do with your state of mind. When anger is clouding your mind, breathe slowly, excuse yourself for a minute or two to go to the toilet, and seize this short break to run a dialogue, asking yourself, what’s wrong today? Are you still angry about the way your friend treated you the other day? Do you feel afraid and insecure about your ability to grow this business with your partner? What’s truly wrong? I got a bit emotional writing these sentences, it’s not easy to claim responsibility for how you act while you can easily deny and ramble about how the other person was rude and ticked you off. Yet, to your dismay and mine, acting like this robs you off your inner peace and quiet. When you appoint your ego to act on your behalf, you come across as cold and void of humbleness. So, to summarize, try your best to take responsibility for how you feel so you can change how you act, and when you fail to do so, and you will fail sometimes, be merciful with yourself and take corrective actions if needed.A bit of help is sometimes needed to apply the above tips; you might be stuck in your life due to a merciless trauma you’ve gone through, trapping you in a vicious circle of unhealthy behaviors. I know how this feels.There’s no way you can truly lead a fulfilling life without coming to terms with your past and focusing on what you can control only. Good therapists can lend a hand, teaching you soul cleansing ways to remedy your never ending pain and move on with your life. I truly believe that success in business or any other endeavor is heavily reliant on your mental health and your ability to deal with the everyday shit that gets thrown down your way. So, if you feel forever stuck in a self sabotaging inner dialogues and a consuming sense of disconnection, maybe it’s time to give it a try and go talk to someone who has enough empathy and wisdom to help you out.The kind point I am wholeheartedly trying to get across here is that taking care of yourself is always wise and helpful in managing different areas of your life with enough clarity to succeed. I truly believe that success is heavily reliant on how you react to hardships and what beliefs you harbor in that mysterious head of yours. Everything else is easy to obtain -- we are teachable by nature and we do live in a state of information clutter and noise, which implies that obtaining information in any field will never be the obstacle. Yet, living with fragile mental health and a sense of meaningless can be the biggest obstacle to surmount. \n"

      "How Understanding Addiction Can Inspire Better Product Building.\n",
      "There are lots of crazy stories out there on how far an addiction pushes people. I personally know many of them, and I am sure that you might know too. Addictions are the most notoriously irrational behaviors that we cannot fathom unless we’ve personally experienced them. To feel at ease, we rather dismiss addicts as intrinsically bad people or just sheer psychopaths, and that’s only because we want a quick explanation to feel less confused and more certain about why addicts do what they do.In the two wonderfully insightful books ‘’Predictably irrational & the upside of irrationality,‘’ Dan Ariely does an amazing job in showing how emotions drive our decision making in the most subtle of ways, from how we’re inclined to order what other people are ordering just to conform even if we dislike it to how we’re likely to rationalize purchases that are bundled with a free item even if it is irrelevant in value, Dan powerfully sets the ground for understanding that in order to to influence customers’ decision making, you’ve got to approach them with enough empathy for their emotional and social needs.  And since addiction is basically about taking the same very bad decision over and over again, understanding what fuels it can provide valuable insights simply because what hooks people to persist in a relationship with a given addiction has similar underlying mechanisms to what can hook people to persist in a relationship with a given product that tries to provide relevant value.  The goal is not to trap users into a toxic dependency like that of addiction, that is something I wish for nobody as I’ve personally experienced it!  Rather, my aim is to shed enough light on the realistic drivers of our decisions. It’s the science of behavioral economics that approaches human decision making with enough empathy and realism as opposed to the standard economics that is primarily fueled with ideal assumptions about our behavioral reactions that rarely align with how we actually behave. So, in the next couple of paragraphs I am going to answer a few interesting questions that I hope to get my point across.The fundamental difference that separates an easily breakable habit from a full blown addiction is the extent to which the behavior satisfies primal psychological needs such as the need to be accepted, seen as competent, loved, noticed, supported, etc.When we experience dull and toxic childhoods, we usually grow up unable to satisfy our psychological needs in healthy ways so we develop alternative coping behaviors that are powerfully medicating yet quite destructive (a.k.a addictions). At a certain point, we come to terms with how screwed up our life is slowly growing to be, yet our addiction is the only way we learnt how to deal with our emotions and bitter struggles. In a sense, it is our God. And that’s why we feel hooked, our addiction becomes synonymous with how we react to life itself so quitting always seems like an existential suicide. When you ask an addict to renounce his addiction, you’re basically asking him to go through a delicate process of reparenting to learn new ways of dealing with life that better works for him, and that’s why recovery is usually a process that needs a supportive environment to increase the likelihood of sobriety.Let me put it differently — to become addicted to any behavior means that this behavior has an excellent offering that fits perfectly what you need which is simply what each of us as product builders try to do: create something with relevant value for a subset of the population, right?You might be hungry for acceptance and love so you get hooked to promiscuous sex so you can derive what you need from having many sexual partners or you might be hungry for feeling competent and noticed so you get hooked on drugs because it makes you feel at the top of your game, able to work more, face people courageously and the like. You get the idea? There’s always a needs / medication fit in addiction, and that’s why we simply get hooked. Nothing super complex here.   Building a sticky relationship with an addictive behavior is not a rational undertaking (or at least never entirely), it is hugely an emotional and social one, and that is super similar to why we start a relationship with a product and stay retained, it hooks us. It satisfies our needs with precision, so we stay. And that is why most of the effective product frameworks rely on helping you identify customers’ needs realistically and prioritize the pains that would help your business grow when you solve them effectively. I personally like the Jobs to be done framework (JTBD) that effectively breaks down customers’ needs to functional, social and emotional ones. It seems simple, doesn’t it? But there’s a lacking factor that deters a lot of entrepreneurs and product managers from intuitively realizing how to solve for their customers if it is missing — the golden keyword in my humble opinion: empathy. Let me tell you why it is immensely significant. Sometimes when you build a viable product that you perceive as functioning, it fails to incur the kind of revenue that indicates its true potential. And you are left clueless as to why these ungrateful customers are abandoning a product that is technically sound and probably even beautifully designed.You might be emotionally detached to the actual experiences of your customers, turning a blind eye to how your technology might qualify for awards but your customers couldn’t care less about it. That usually happens when you are not truly building for your customers but more for what you believe qualifies for a good sounding feature. And the solution to this dangerous detachment to what your customers truly need is empathy — I’ve recently initiated contact with a number of my customers and got to know them as friends. I added them to a Whatsapp group, started getting to know them personally and showing sincere interest in their day to day fitness struggles, and instead of developing solutions for them, I developed solutions with them.We started getting on calls together, asking for their valuable feedback regarding certain stuff, even sharing hilarious fitness memes and that matured my understanding of how I can further develop my product to meet all of their macro and micro needs in a glorious fashion, and thus positively hook them emotionally to sustaining a high LTV.So, in a sense, empathy is always the key to understanding what you don’t understand, be it addiction or why the hell your customers are apathetic to your state of the art technology infrastructure. Think about it, you develop a relationship with a product because it satisfies your needs and you stay in the relationship because it persists to do so. And that’s what we attempt to create, ‘’ a relationship. ‘’ We build products that are relevant enough in value to activate a relationship and sustain it, and if your customers are churning madly, it’s simply because there are loopholes that kill the relationship in its infancy. And how can you fix that? Talk to your customers in the friendliest and most sincere fashion of all. Drop your preconceived notions and approach them with enough humility and empathy to make it work for them, and that’s how everybody wins!  I believe if you understand your customers’ needs realistically, you can create a market for a product that didn’t previously exist because, in its simplest term, a market represents a consensus from a large group of people that X is needed to satisfy what they are consciously seeking to satisfy for which they are willing to pay money.But sometimes people are unaware of what product / service they might use if it became available and here lies the creative process of following an intuition and capitalizing on it with enough customer interviews and research to crystallize a MVP that you can test.   \n",
      "3 Signs Your SaaS is Ready to Go To Market.\n",
      "If you’re asking yourself whether your business is market-ready, you’re in great company. Determining the timing for the release of a SaaS is one of the main conundrums faced by old and new founders alike.The premature release of a product that has major overlooked software flaws can turn off potential customers immediately, with no chance to remedy the bad first impression.Waiting too long, on the other hand, carries its own risks.Any delay in release also delays income; any unexpected expenses could put the business at serious risk of flopping before it even sees the light of day.Imagine this: you’re weeks away from release and have run out of seed money earlier than anticipated. The entire budget has been spent on R&D with nothing left for customer acquisition. With no clients at this stage, you also have no revenue to redress this imbalance. The only way out is to increase seed money from your own pocket, or raise external capital – and desperation is the worst place to negotiate from.The second risk stems from your competition.You analyzed the landscape, found an untapped niche, had a great idea for a solution, and are now building a business around it. The problem is that you’re not the only one looking at that landscape. Chances are, someone else spotted the same opportunity, and is developing a solution of their own.SaaS is one of the fastest growing sectors of entrepreneurship. The resources to found a business, be it information, hardware, or finance, are available to an ever-growing pool of people.Make no mistake: in this climate, developing a SaaS business is a race. Wait too long to go to market with your nearly-finished product, and you’re essentially stopping 100 meters from the finish line to tie your laces, giving the competition the best chance of catching up. That gap in the market you spotted? It could disappear right out from underneath you.Are you looking for insights into your SaaS business’s financial health? Baremetrics offers over 26 different metrics that track your financial information, including MRR, customer LTV, quick ratio, and many more. Sign up today for a free trial.If your SaaS is either in the final stages of development, or the early stages of going live, ask yourself the following questions:Is more than half your budget still going to R&D?Is less than a third allocated to marketing and customer acquisition?Do you feel like the finishing touches are dragging out indefinitely, and pushing you over budget?If the answer to any of those is ‘yes’, read on. You could be making one of the critical mistakes many first-time founders make at this stage.It doesn’t have to be perfect to be making you money.It’s only natural to want to make the best product you possibly can. A passion for creating something amazing is probably what inspired and fueled your journey into founding a business to begin with.But here’s the thing. You don’t need to sacrifice ‘great’ for ‘good enough’, at least not forever. Fundamentally, ‘great’ in this context means catering to the needs of your audience. A perfect solution for a non-existing problem is still a terrible product.No matter how well you know your audience, there will inevitably be requirements or ways of using your software you can’t anticipate. Failing to anticipate customer usage most likely isn’t an oversight on your part either: their needs will be as unique as your clients, and be shaped by their team, geography, current software solutions, and so forth.Don’t be afraid to get your rough drafts out there and in the hands of some beta testers. The earlier you involve testers and potential clients, the more likely you are to create something that is truly beneficial to them, and avoid wasting money overdeveloping dead ends.Especially in the case of SaaS models, R&D is never a finished process. To stay at the top of the market, you will have to keep developing the product regardless of how good it is at its launch. So let go of the idea of perfect, and get it out there to make you some money!All too frequently, customer acquisition is either underfunded or overlooked entirely during this stage of development. The ‘if you build it, they will come’ motto could not be less true for SaaS businesses.Simply put, you won’t attract customers if you’re not directly marketing to them. A significant portion of the budget needs to be allocated to customer acquisition as soon as the product is anywhere near the stage of being ready to go to market.That doesn’t mean pulling all resources from R&D; once you’ve brought some customers aboard, you can start redirecting funds to engineering to complete the finishing touches.The key here is that customer acquisition should happen simultaneously with those finishing touches, and not wait until after the launch of the ‘perfected’ product.Consider the three main steps of the launch cycle:Pilot itNail itScale itThe sooner you can effectively go from the drawing board to the pilot stage, the higher the chances of success. Still wondering whether your product is ready to go to market? Here are three signs that it’s time to take your SaaS to the next step, according to each stage.‘Pilot it’ 🧑‍✈️ beta testers are giving mostly positive feedback‘Nail it’  🔨 10 unaffiliated customers who haven’t churned‘Scale it’  🧗 ready for fundingThe purpose of beta testers is two-fold. On the one hand, they will help you iron out the bugs in the software before it’s fit to go to market.On the other, beta testers will help determine who your ICPs (Ideal Customer Profile) are, and in some ways more importantly, who they are not. That means narrowing down who to target through customer acquisition, and avoiding the pitfalls of developing software solutions for clients who ultimately won’t bring in enough revenue to justify these development costs.Once the ICP-like beta testers are sufficiently happy with your product, it’s time to acquire your first real clients.You can attract your first customers and incentivize them to provide on-going feedback by offering early-bird subscription rates.Success in this stage is achieved by really listening to the feedback and adapting your product to it, even if it deviates somewhat from the original idea. This is its most malleable point before the nailing and scaling cycles, which means the closer you can get to creating a perfect solution for your ICPs, the more money it can make you in the long run, and faster.The golden rule of SaaS businesses is that if you can acquire 10 unaffiliated customers, i.e. clients who have no personal connection or incentivized loyalty to your business, you can acquire 100. At that point, it’s simply a matter of time and reach.If those 10 haven’t churned after a full billing cycle, you know the product is good enough. Keep just enough funds in R&D for upkeep and finessing, and allocate the rest of the available resources to customer acquisition:Start cold calling and emailing potential leadsSend resources to leads to make your product most attractive to themCreate SEM (Search Engine Marketing) paid advertisementsRun A/B testing to determine which campaign strategies work best in three subcategories:KeywordsAdvertisementsLanding pagesCreate comparison pages on your website highlighting why your product is the best solution in your market cornerRun targeted paid advertisements against competitorsDon’t hesitate to experiment with different marketing techniques to see what’s most effective for your product.‘Is dinner ready yet?’‘Well it has to be, I’m hungry.’The ‘needs must’ approach may seem like a seriously back-to-front way of determining whether your SaaS is ready to go to market or not.But consider this. Your resources (probably!) aren’t unlimited. If you’re getting close to empty pockets, it’s high time to stop nitpicking and just get it out there, flaws and all.If you’re looking to raise funds, whether it’s through an angel investor or a venture capitalist, you need to demonstrate your profitability. The only real way to show that your business can succeed at scale is with actual revenue figures.Quality may be the most important factor to you, but generally speaking, angels and VCs aren’t searching for perfect software, they’re targeting a great investment opportunity with fast and reliable returns.The better your early numbers look, the better deal you’ll be able to negotiate yourself, too. This equally holds true if you’re bootstrapping the business: your SaaS’s financial survival depends on becoming profitable through steady growth. And that means acquiring some clients, pronto.The take-away is this:Good is better than perfect; now is better than later.So, are you ready?For more insights, sign up today for a 14 day trial with Baremetrics.

      "What is the LTV to CAC Ratio?.\n",
      "Ever heard about the golden ratio? No, not that nerdy Fibonacci number thing.I am talking about the SaaS golden ratio. It’s 3:1. Where did this even come from and why is it important? Well, this number is the ideal LTV to CAC ratio for SaaS businesses. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of how it’s calculated and why it matters. If you want to get in-depth metrics for your SaaS or subscription business, start using Baremetrics today with a 14 day free trial. There are multiple ways to calculate the LTV to CAC ratio, some of them being more complex than the others. In this article, I will give you a simple way to calculate it using only two inputs, namely CAC and LTV.I’ll go through them one by one so you can clearly understand the topic.As the name suggests, CAC is the cost of acquiring one new customer. It is the sum of all the money spent on acquiring new customers divided by the total number of new customers acquiredSo, if you have spent $10,000 to gain 2000 new customers, your CAC is $5. Looking at the equation, you might be thinking it’s obvious and straightforward. And you won’t be wrong.But there are some mistakes you have to avoid while calculating CAC as they can have some serious implications. You must remember the two rules of calculating CAC. First, do not count the money spent on retaining the existing customers. You must include only the costs associated with gaining new customers. Second, do not restrict to marketing expenses only. This one is crucial because it’s a common mistake you might be making. You must consider all the direct and indirect expenses associated with acquiring new customers. That includes salaries of the marketing team and other such indirect expenses.Every business stands on one thing: customers - and they don’t come free. You have to spend thousands of dollars on various marketing channels to get them. The amount you spend on acquiring those customers, aka CAC, is a crucial figure that you can’t afford to ignore. Having a good understanding of your CAC helps you make better decisions and tells you where you should allocate your revenue. This is especially true for SaaS and subscription businesses, as they rely on recurring revenue earned from a customer over a long period. CAC becomes crucial in this case. If you spend too much money on acquiring a new customer, it will probably take you a long time before you recover that money, let alone make any profit from that customer. Which is obviously not a good thing. Also, knowing about CAC for particular marketing channels and the behavior of those customers will help you focus on the channels that bring more customers, or more profitable customers. Let’s imagine a scenario:Suppose you spend $10,000 total on ad campaigns; $5000 on Facebook ads and $5000 on Google ads. You get 1000 new customers from Facebook ads, and 600 from Google ads. The CAC would be $5 for Facebook ads and $8.3 for Google ads.As getting new customers is cheaper on Facebook, you might want to focus more on Facebook ads. But let’s make it more interesting.Let’s say the customers you got from Facebook are not willing to spend money on your products. On the other hand, the customers you got from Google ads tend to stick longer with you and are willing to spend money. What now? How do you decide which customers are more valuable to you and where you should focus more?This shows us that CAC in itself is just an empty number. It tells us almost nothing. Whenever we talk about the cost of acquiring a new customer, it’s significant only in relation to what we earn from that customer. Put simply, CAC is important when it’s considered in relation to LTV. Therefore, these two metrics always go hand in hand.So, let’s talk about LTV.The LTV means the amount of money a customer spends on your products over their lifetime. This figure is crucial for SaaS businesses because their life depends on it. The only profitable way to run a SaaS or subscription business is through having a pool of customers who stay with you for a long time and are ready to pay. In short, having customers with a high LTV is the key. It seems quite hard to predict how much money a customer will give you over their lifetime, and it actually is. That’s why we don’t rely on predictions, but on calculations. Considering that a number of variables go into this and how complicated it can look if you are not familiar with it, I will guide you through the process of arriving at the formula for calculating LTV instead of pulling it out of thin air. This will make things easier. Keep in mind, however, that you cannot calculate LTV in the initial stages of your business because you don’t have enough data for that. With that being said, let’s move on to some (not so) nerdy calculations.The simplest way of calculating the LTV of a single customer is to take the money they spend each month and multiply it by their lifetime — which is the number of months they stay with you. But, this is not a practical method since you have (hopefully) more than one customer. Also, it’s virtually impossible to predict how long a customer will stay.So, to calculate the LTV of multiple customers, we have to find a metric that takes into account the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) of a number of customers. ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) is just what we are looking for. It’s MRR divided by the total number of customers.Now, we have to calculate the lifespan of a customer in months. To do that calculation, take the monthly user churn and invert it. By combining these two equations and bingo, we get our final formula for LTV:Now, before you proceed to hit me with Thor’s hammer for throwing all this math, let me tell you that you don’t have to go through any of this. What’s the one word that can describe the goals of any business in the world? PROFIT !!!From marketing to metrics and everything in between, it’s all intended to maximize profit.LTV is intimately linked to your financial gains. Increasing customer retention — which, in turn, means increasing the LTV — by 5% can increase the profit by 25% to 95%, says Bain and Company. Remember that physics lesson from school where you learned how you can lift a massive object with a little force? No worries if you don’t. Here’s a quick review.It’s something called Leverage, though it also has a fancy name, Torque.For fear of sounding too nerdy, I won’t go too much into the details. But the point is, if you want to spend the least of your energy, you can lift a heavy load with a little effort by acting smart. To do this, you simply have to increase the “moment arm,'' which is the length of the lever between the pivot and the point where you are exerting force.Since “efficiency” is simply the ratio between Load and Effort, the more you lift with as little effort as possible, the more “efficient” you are. This is exactly how I visualize LTV/CAC. Look at the following equation.It’s the same thing as “efficiency” in my head. To be efficient in business, you have to keep a close look at this ratio. The more LTV you can create with lesser the CAC, the more profitable your business will be. Reverse the scenario and you are doomed. And this is why this ratio is so important.With just two inputs, LTV to CAC ratio alone can do you more favor than a bunch of metrics combined. While benchmarks such as ARR, MRR, Churn are undoubtedly important, they tell you in bits and pieces about where you are headed and you might get lost in some dark alley.LTV/CAC, on the other hand, gives you a zoomed out, crystal clear map in a snapshot.Investors look for a good LTV to CAC ratio before investing in your business. I have mentioned this number in the introduction, here I’ll go into some details.I know I have said earlier that you should focus on maximizing LTV while minimizing CAC. That might have given you the wrong impression that a super high LTV/CAC is always the goal. It’s not.The ideal LTV to CAC ratio is 3:1. Which means that ideally you should be getting $3 in return for every $1 you spend on getting new customers. If you get 1:1, your business is really struggling. Less than 1:1, you are going into loss - you are spending more than you are getting in return.While it may look exciting to see a super high ratio such as 5:1 or more, it’s not ideal. Yes, you are getting a high return on investment, but it also suggests that there's room for spending more on acquiring new customers. A ratio of 5:1 means a really high LTV, which means your customers are happy with your product and are willing to spend. So, getting new users can multiply your revenue.So, never forget the golden ratio, 3:1.LTV to CAC ratio is a must-not-ignore number for SaaS and subscription businesses. It gives you a clear and precise overview of how your business is doing. Keep a close look at this ratio if you want to have a successful SaaS business.You can use Baremetrics for more detailed insights. Start your free trial now.\n"

      "What is the ASC 606?.\n",
      "The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) set out in 2014 to provide a framework to attain consistency in financial reporting, improve comparative analysis and reporting, and simplify the drafting of financial statements.This framework is what we now call the ASC 606. The ASC 606 outlines a five-step model for revenue recognition. The five steps are as follows:Identify the contract with a customer.Identify the performance obligations in the contract.Determine the transaction price.Allocate the transaction price.Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.These rules are now enforced for both private and public businesses. As a subscription-based SaaS enterprise, you need to be aware of these rules and follow them. These rules help you understand when revenue has been earned under the accrual accounting system.In this article, we briefly explain the five steps of revenue recognition that the ASC 606 outlines so that you can make sure you are implementing it correctly. In addition, we will discuss the implications for SaaS businesses, why the rules were changed, and the meaning of revenue recognition in general.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Baremetrics supports the correct implementation of ASC 606 accounting.Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.(Full disclosure: The writer of this article has an educational background in accountancy and well over a decade of experience running a business, but this article does not replace real legal advice. This article is meant to explain the origin and reasoning behind ASC 606 and the five-step model outlined for revenue recognition to demystify the process and reasoning. As always, consult with your licensed accountant before adopting processes you read about online.)Revenue recognition is based on the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and stipulates when you can record your revenue. While in the cash accounting system revenue is recognized when the cash is received, in the accrual accounting system, which tax authorities generally require businesses to follow, it is recognized when the revenue has been earned and realized. The latter is where ASC 606 comes in. It is designed to make it easier for companies to consistently recognize revenue based on the same standards. By following ASC 606, all SaaS businesses will count their revenue based on the same benchmarks.Revenue recognition can be incredibly complex, which is why so many companies resort to revenue recognition software that can take complicated data and display it in a clear way. However, with so many applications available, choosing the right software is no easy task.Powerful and flexible data models: Your SaaS business can bring in revenue through many different models, and you need software that can work with those different models. You need a platform that can calculate your MRR and ARR even when you have multiple pricing tiers. You also need it to be able to segment customers based on different attributes, from geographic location to lifetime of the contract. Baremetrics has you covered with its customer segmentation tools.Seamless integration with other applications: Your company will never survive relying on a single piece of software. The world is too complex for that now. You probably use a customer relationship service (CRM) as well as a payment gateway (or, more likely, several gateways). If your recognition software isn’t able to integrate with these tools, then it isn’t going to be able to get the most of your data. Baremetrics integrates with Chargify and Stripe, and users can import and analyze PayPal and Chargebee data via the Baremetrics API.Configurable templates and rules: You need adaptive tools to make sure they work for you—and tools that can change with you so that they keep working into the future.Forecasting capabilities: It isn’t only about reporting revenue that has already come in, but also forecasting how much will be earned for months or years into the future. For a SaaS business, that means finding a tool that can calculate all your core metrics—ARR, MRR, LTV, etc.Whether you have earned revenue but not received the cash or have cash coming in that you have not yet earned, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data so that you always know how much cash you have on hand, which clients have paid, and who you still owe services to. When you have many clients, some are subscribed on an annual basis while others monthly, with multiple tiers and various add-ons, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV , and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.As mentioned above, ASC 606 presents a five-step model for when revenue should be recognized. Let’s look briefly at each step.ASC 606 defines a contract as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. The following attributes are defined by the standards as essential parts of a contract:All parties have approved the agreement. All parties are committed to fulfilling their obligations.Each party’s rights are identifiable.Payment terms are identified. The contract has commercial substance.Collectibility is probable. A performance obligation is the promise by a company to transfer goods or provide services to its customer. Under this step, the company must identify all of its distinct performance obligations in the arrangement defined in Step 1.A good or service is distinct when two conditions are met:The customer would be able to benefit from the good or service on its own or with resources the customer already has access to.The good or service could be transferred independent of other performance obligations in the contract (even if it will be transferred with other goods or services). The following issues may affect an entity’s evaluation of performance obligations:Being the principle or agentWarrantiesCustomer options for additional goods or servicesNon-refundable upfront feesRights of returnStand-ready obligations (i.e., for the service to be available at all times even when not being used)The transaction price is how much the company expects to be given for providing the goods or services promised in Step 1. This amount can be fixed, variable, or a combination of both (for example, if you charge a certain fee per month to have access to your SaaS offering plus usage fees).The transaction price is then allocated to the performance obligations identified in Step 2. In doing so, any optional fees are excluded. Sales taxes along with any other amount that third parties will eventually collect are also excluded.When a fixed amount of cash is transferred at the same time as the services are rendered, this is easy. However, the following complications may require further consideration:Variable considerationSignificant financing componentNoncash considerationConsideration paid or payable to a customerNon-refundable upfront feesWhen a contract has multiple performance obligations, then the seller should allocate the total consideration to each of the performance obligations based on its standalone price.ASC 606 allows companies to use any method for determining the standalone price—so long as the estimation is accurate. However, the standard does mention three specific methods as being acceptable: adjustment market assessment, expected cost plus margin, and residual.If variable considerations or discounts exist within the contract, then the seller must determine which performance obligation is discounted or has a variable component and allocate them only to that obligation. Finally, the company must recognize the allocated revenue of each performance obligation as that obligation has been satisfied. When the obligation is satisfied over time, then the revenue is recognized at the end of that period. There are several issues that companies should consider when applying Step 5 of this method:Determine whether a performance obligation is satisfied over timeIndicators of transfer of controlInput methods vs. output methodsStand-ready obligationsConsignmentBill And hold arrangementsNote that these steps are heavily summarized (in fact, each bullet point under each step can represent several pages of text in the ASC 606), and you should make a point of reading the entire document at some point.

      "How to Do Price Analysis for SaaS.\n",
      "Price analysis is a shortcut to understanding what the market considers a fair and reasonable price. Instead of examining the specific cost and profit structure of your company and comparing it to the estimated costs and profits of competitors to determine the price point for your product, price analysis looks at the market to see what price points would be considered acceptable by customers. Sometimes the information needed for a more in-depth analysis of the market isn’t available, or the timeframe in which you need to make a decision is too short for a more accurate pricing strategy. In this case, looking to competitors and gauging client reactions to pricing experiments is both sufficient and better for its timeliness. Cost analysis is a companion term. It is the dissection of the entire service to determine the likely cost behind each portion to come up with an estimate of a vendor’s cost structure. From there, in consideration of the normal markup of your industry, you can determine whether their pricing strategy is reasonable.Both price analysis and cost analysis are useful for determining how you should price your SaaS subscription, as well as for costing the products and services you use to develop, market, and render your software service.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards. With this information at your hands, it is easy to see whether your prices are fair and reasonable.A competitive price analysis entails the evaluation of how consumers react to new prices. It is generally based on historical data or some form of polling. We discuss some ways to gather consumer behavior a bit more below. In general, price analysis examines how customers respond to a price based on their perceived value, instead of the costs to produce the product or service, or the profit generated by the company.The key benefit of competitive price analysis is that it mirrors the actions of typical consumers. The vast majority of consumers compare the prices, as well as quality, features, convenience, etc., of products before deciding which to purchase. If you want your product to stand out as being the cheapest, highest quality, or best value-for-money option, then you need to be doing the same. You should be intimately aware of all the comparative products on the market, their features, what they cost, and even how and where they are marketed. You can use all that information to help be the final choice of consumers as they peruse the marketplace.Now that you have a basic grasp of what competitive price analysis is and why it is important, let’s look at a detailed methodology for performing a successful competitive price analysis.1. Gather high-quality data. It is absolutely crucial to start your analysis with high-quality data, and as much data as you can find. Data also needs to be timely. If your data is six months out of date, it is useless. In some cases, if it is 15 minutes out of date, it is less effective.2. Define your data parameters. You need to know what is important and what isn’t to effectively analyze the market. This is how you pull the information from the data. For example, if you can follow the promotions of your competitors in real time, then you can see how the peaks and valleys in their prices translate to higher or lower sales for you. It might be that you are priced too high, that your own promos are not well timed to those of your competitors, or that your customers are fairly price inelastic and you can raise prices for a higher margin.3. Categorize your competitors. Once you have evaluated the market, defined the parameters you need to track, and are gathering high-quality and timely data, it is time to categorize the other companies in your market. One way of categorizing them is into your primary, secondary, and tertiary competition.Primary competition includes all the direct competitors competing for the same customers as you with a similar service.Secondary competition includes all companies that are targeting the same product class as you, but they are slightly different in configuration. For example, they might be the high-price, high-quality version of your product or the cheap and rudimentary one.Tertiary competition includes the companies that are selling products similar to yours. These companies are important to track as well in case you want to expand the number of products you offer.  4. Use machine-based pricing tools. When you have a real-time understanding of your market, it becomes possible to use advanced algorithms to control your pricing strategy. In this case, the data is processed by the algorithm to see how the market is changing moment by moment. Then, the same algorithm can constantly tweak your prices to gauge the reaction of your customers and push your profit higher. These precision pricing strategies can really improve the profitability of a company.As an added bonus, by allowing an algorithm to perform your competitive price analysis and set your prices automatically, you are free to spend time on more important work. For example, you can focus on the long-term strategy of your company, or start developing your next service line.5. Track competitors’ social media activity. Although your competitor’s pricing is the single most important item to track, it isn’t the only thing worth watching. You can get a great deal of information by following their social media. See what they are posting and how much engagement different posts receive. In this way, you might be able to time and word your own posts to garner more interactions. Whatever your SaaS pricing template, understanding what your competitors are doing is important. When using that information to set your pricing strategy, consider all the different SaaS pricing models. If it makes sense, try to segment your customers with a tiered pricing model.Baremetrics is a business metrics monitoring tool that acts as a dashboard for your business. You can see MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Check out the demo account here. Baremetrics can help you analyze how pricing experiments affect your revenue.  Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing the results of your competitive marketing analysis now.One of the hardest questions in business to answer is: What is your customer’s willingness to pay? This tells you exactly how much you can charge a customer for your product before they walk to a competitor or exit the market entirely. Every prospective client has a different willingness to pay, and it is based on their personal characteristics, market characteristics, the current state of the world, and so much more.One key term when contemplating a customer’s willingness to pay is their price elasticity. Price elasticity simply means the amount demand changes when price changes. A perfectly elastic market will crash with even the smallest price increase, whereas a perfectly inelastic market will absorb any price increase without a change in demand. In general, things you need that have no similar substitute goods have very low elasticity (e.g., rent), whereas luxury goods with many similar items on the market have high elasticity (e.g., meals at restaurants). In some cases, it is possible to raise prices without upsetting customers (if done carefully), while in other cases you might see high churn.Conducting a pricing experiment is something that every SaaS business should do, and it’s better to do them often. One common method is performing a survey. You can do this by phone, mail, email, or using a survey platform. Be sure to choose your survey population carefully so it matches your customer profile. Otherwise, the data you collect will be flawed and any pricing decisions you make are sure to be less than optimum.Sometimes a small pricing change can drastically change the profitability of your company. Whatever clients are willing to pay, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data. Combined with good data from your competitors, this is the easiest way to ensure your prices are in line with the market and maximizing your revenue.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. It can be difficult to calculate your MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), etc. That’s why there is Baremetrics to do it all for you. Baremetrics can monitor all the data you need to see if you have optimized your pricing model based on your competition.

      "Willingness to Pay: What It Is and How to Find It.\n",
      "Unlike some economic terms, this one is pretty self-explanatory. Willingness to pay is the maximum amount a customer is willing to pay for your product or service. Although customers might be happy to pay less than this amount, they will not pay more.Willingness to pay is calculated separately for each person and then aggregated into a range; the lower bound being where all people are willing to pay for your service (unfortunately, sometimes this is $0), and the upper bound being where one customer is still willing to pay for your service.As we will explain below, you can ask people if a price is acceptable and then record the responses. At a specific high price (the upper bound) no one will say yes, while at a specific low price (the lower bound, hopefully not $0) all those surveyed will say yes. In any Econ 101 course, you can see this range of acceptable prices represented as the demand curve on a basic supply and demand graph:Although willingness to pay and willingness to accept sound similar and deal with the same topic, they are quite different. Willingness to pay is the maximum amount a prospective customer is willing to pay for your services. Willingness to accept is the minimum amount you are willing to accept for your service.Willingness to pay is a consideration of the value your service provides to the prospective client, while willingness to accept is based on your cost structure. As mentioned above, willingness to pay varies greatly from one person to the next, and is affected by many factors. At the individual level, much of this variance can be accounted for by the person’s extrinsic and intrinsic differences. Observable extrinsic differences can include the customer’s gender, age, income, education, and location. Intrinsic differences are harder to spot from the outside and require asking the customer directly. These can include their interest in a subject or behavioral traits.Beyond the character of the individual customers, there are many other factors that can affect willingness to pay over time.Indeed, it is worth pointing out here that willingness to pay is not a static value—what a customer is willing to pay today is not the same as what they are willing to pay tomorrow. Van Gogh couldn’t sell a painting when he was alive and now his portfolio is worth billions, while you’d have difficulty selling a VHS cassette today.The state of the economy has a major impact on willingness to pay. When customers think the economy is doing poorly (or there will be a downturn soon), they are less willing to spend money and become more price sensitive.The season can change the willingness to pay. While someone might be willing to pay top dollar to replace their snowboard mid-winter, they are more likely to shop around come summer.Brand recognition is a huge component of willingness to pay. If your company is trendy, you can expect to be able to charge a lot more for the same product.The rareness of a product is a driver of price. This is another case where perception might be more important than reality too—if customers perceive your product as rare, then they may be willing to pay more. The quality of a product can change the amount a customer is willing to pay. Sometimes brands focus on high quality at a high price, but there is also money to be made from selling low-quality products at a cheap price in high quantity. It really depends on the cost structure and what your targeted clients demand.Sudden needs can radically change the perceived value of a product. When a product is suddenly in short supply, its perceived value can skyrocket. This is why small bottles of water are often more expensive than big ones. When you are out on the town and thirsty, you are willing to pay more than you are for water that you will bring home and drink later.Understanding what your prospective clients are willing to pay is important. When trying to figure out your market, consider all the different SaaS pricing models. If it makes sense, try to segment your customers with a tiered pricing model.Without a keen understanding of your clients’ willingness to pay, you will never achieve an optimal pricing strategy. The only sure way to calculate the willingness to pay is by asking your prospective customers. But how do you get them to tell the truth? The short answer is to ask them in many different ways. Here are three strategies you can employ to figure out exactly what your customers are willing to pay.Surveys: Surveys are a great way to get information from a large population. There are many different ways to survey people to figure out their willingness to pay. You could directly ask prospective customers what they are willing to pay for your product. This could be an open-ended question where the person writes in a number, a point on a number line, or take the form of anchoring to a specific number, e.g., “Would you be willing to pay $50?”You could also indirectly ask the population by having them rank the value of different features, possibly including products that are better known in your market with familiar price points.You can also directly ask your current customer base how they feel about the price or what potential new products they’d be most interested in seeing added and are willing to pay extra for.Focus Groups: While surveys are a great way to get a little information from many different people, focus groups are a great way to get a lot of information from a small group. Be sure to pick the participants carefully and create an environment where truthfulness is assured.Remember, focus groups give you the chance to gather more detailed information than surveys. Be precise and thoughtful with your questions. Keep them open-ended; they can’t be answered with “yes” or “no”.  If you need to elaborate on a participant's answer, ask follow up questions. Should you be new to focus groups, consider employing the services of a specialist market research company.Experiments to ascertain revealed preference: This one is a bit trickier. It requires you to actually adjust prices and pay structures, possibly separately for different client groups. Then, you can see how your actual sales numbers have changed. This can be challenging, so it might be less risky with a strong and loyal customer base. Likewise, if your customer acquisition costs are higher than your customer’s lifetime value and you need to make a drastic change, this can help you find a better price point.When considering your pricing strategy, it is important to understand what your customers are willing to pay, but that’s not all. Let’s take a look at the following simple example. After a well-designed focus group, you have the following information from 10 prospective clients:As you can see, while all 10 clients would be willing to subscribe to your service for $10/month, none would pay $100. In addition, there are actually two points that maximize your revenue. While 7 clients would pay $40 for a total revenue of $280, 4 would pay $70 each for the same total revenue of $280. So what is the best price to pick? Well that depends on many other factors. If your marginal costs are $5, then with 7 clients you would have a gross profit of $245, while with 4 it would be $260. However, it might be easier to grow your business long term with the lower price point and eventually that would lead to a bigger profit in the long term.If your marginal costs are $40, however, then you wouldn’t make any money at the lower price point and should choose $70.Perhaps it would be better to consider why 4 of the 7 clients willing to pay $40 are also willing to pay $70. Maybe your SaaS platform has specific features that are only valuable to some clients. In that case, it might be possible to offer two service packages, one for $40 that 3 clients would sign up for and another for $70 that 4 more clients would sign up for totaling $400 in subscription revenue.Sometimes a small pricing change can have outsized changes to your revenue.Whatever clients are willing to pay, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data. Maximizing your revenue stream also complicates your accounting. Without the right tools, it can be difficult to understand whether changes are leading to real growth.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, some are subscribed on an annual basis while others monthly, with multiple tiers and various add-ons, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), and so much more.

      "Revenue vs. Income.\n",
      "Revenue and income are sometimes used synonymously in day-to-day conversation, however they are very different terms in business, and it is important to have a strong grasp of both. While revenue refers to all the money your company is bringing in through sales, income is the amount of money left over after your expenses have been paid. While revenue growth generally indicates an increasing popularity of your product or service, increasing income suggests that not only is your business growing but also you are keeping a good management of your operating expenses. The former is nice to have, but the latter is what will be of interest to investors.Having a close watch on your revenue and expenses is fundamental to guarantee the longevity of your business. For any company following the SaaS subscription revenue model, that means understanding the basic metrics of your company.Baremetrics monitors your metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the Baremetrics insights are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, and quick ratio. With this information on a crystal-clear dashboard, it is easy to see how your company’s profitability is changing over time. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Revenue is all the money generated by a company from interactions with customers. For most companies, this roughly amounts to total sales, but, for a SaaS company, things can be a little different. To follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), you will count your revenue the same way (following either the cash accounting method or the accrual accounting method). Projected revenue is an estimate of how much money a company will generate. When trying to project your future revenue and revenue trends, there is a quick rule of thumb that we can use.For a subscription revenue model, we can take a look at a variant of the ecommerce growth formula:where V is the visitors, CR is the conversion rate, LTV is the lifetime value, and REVENUE is the revenue generated. To put this into plain English, the equation tells you what it takes to drive a prospective client to your page (V), get them to sign up for your service (CR), and keep them happy over time (LTV).The LTV is calculated using the Average Customer Lifetime (ACL) and the Average Order Value (AOV). Keep in mind that the above equation has no time limit other than the lifetime of the average customer, so it doesn’t coincide with a single reporting period. Your financial period will probably be shorter than your ACL, so the revenue you record on your income statement will only be a portion of the “PROJECTED REVENUE” defined in the equation above.Once you have calculated your revenue, you can begin to understand the profitability of your company. Gross profit is the amount of money a company makes after the Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS) is subtracted from revenue. COGS generally includes all the variable costs associated with the product you sell. For a SaaS business, this can include transaction fees, licensing fees, and development expenses.EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is revenue minus the COGS mentioned above as well as operating expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Finally, net income is the final profit remaining after all the above is removed.In summary, net income, sometimes called “the bottom line” for where it appears on the income statement, is revenue, which is sometimes called “the top line” for the same reason, minus COGS; operating expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses; and interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Note that, while EBITDA and net income are also different concepts, EBITDA is also often called net income when there is no chance of confusion.Similar to our discussion on net revenue vs. operating income, revenue and net income are closely related subjects but their distinction is important. While revenue is the money coming into your company in the form of sales, net income is the money left over after all the different kinds of expenses have been paid. While revenue changes can help you predict the future growth of your company, net income is more important from the investors’ standpoint as it can tell you whether your pricing model is viable. You can learn more about this by considering the unit economics version of this discussion.If you’re still using spreadsheets and basic dashboards to monitor and manage your revenue and expenses, you’re not only operating inefficiently, but you’re also probably leaving money on the table.The advanced analytics and reporting tools offered by Baremetrics bring you an affordable, fast, and flexible means to ensure you stay on top of and optimize your SaaS business’s revenue and net income.Baremetrics does all the grunt work, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. The easy-to-read dashboard gives you a complete view of your expenses, profit, and net income for your specified financial period. All this allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.Revenue and net income both appear on the income statement. Let’s look at the sample income statement below:Sample Income StatementPeriodOctoberNovemberDecemberRevenueMonthly Subscriptions50,00055,00060,000Yearly Subscriptions20,00020,00020,000Add-Ons1,0002,0003,000Total Revenue71,00077,00083,000Costs of Goods Sold3rd Party Fees(5,000)(5,000)(5,000)Transaction Fees(1,000)(1,000)(1,000)Customer support(10,000)(8,000)(12,000)Development Costs(5,000)(5,000)(5,000)Licensing(1,000)(1,000)(1,000)Total Costs of Goods(22,000)(20,000)(24,000)Gross Profit49,00057,00059,000Operating ExpenseSG&A*(15,000)(16,000)(17,000)Marketing(20,000)(22,000)(24,000)Total Operating Expenses(35,000)(38,000)(41,000)Net Income (EBITDA)14,00019,00018,000* Note that SG&A stands for selling, general, and administrative expenses. This includes all the everyday operating expenses of a company that are not included in production and delivery of your service. SG&A typically includes distribution costs, rent, and salaries. It sometimes also includes advertising and marketing as well, but for the sake of this example marketing is listed separately.The income statement above is reporting three separate monthly periods, from October to December. The company’s revenue has been split up to show that some of the money is coming from monthly subscriptions, some is from annual subscriptions, and the rest is from add-on sales. The total is rising monthly from $71,000 in October to $83,000 in December. The great news shown by the rising revenue numbers is echoed with rising gross profit as well, from $49,000 in October to $59,000 in December. In fact, the company was able to maintain a very similar COGS structure while raising revenue. This might be a good sign that the company is showing economies of scale—that the marginal cost of providing their service is decreasing as the number of clients increases. That’s a great position to be in!For net income, the story is a little different. While the net income did increase from $14,000 in October to $18,000 in December, the highest value was in November at $19,000. What is happening to their operating expenses? It looks like their SG&A is creeping up month to month. This could be the nature of the business—as they scale, the need to hire more staff or increase the size of their office—or it could be a signal that a culture of waste is taking hold. While young startups are famously lean, sometimes with maturity comes the same excess as seen in established corporations. If you are worried about rising expenses, take a look at our guide to managing total expenses.While marketing expenses are also increasing by $2,000/month, this might not be as big a concern as revenue is also going up by a multiple of 2.5 times the increased marketing budget. While it is always prudent to keep an eye on the marketing budget to confirm that it is driving the right visitors to your site and improving your conversion rate, more is not necessarily worse—as no marketing means no customers!Determining your company’s revenue and net income is important since the foundation of any ecommerce business is analytics and reporting. These two categories contain the majority of the data that the company requires. Dashboards as well as metrics, and other sales-growing insights and tools, are also included with Baremetrics. When analyzing data, context is key. With this, Baremetrics is more concerned with assisting you in determining what you need to do with numbers rather than displaying them to you. You must be able to see why things change, for example why clients leave. Therefore, Baremetrics cuts through the clutter and delivers the information you need to make smart business decisions. Look at what’s going on right now, plan for tomorrow, and prepare for the future, all in one place.  Due to the target specialty of subscription businesses, Baremetrics provides a global dashboard with all relevant subscription metrics. The dashboard provides 20 metrics including annual run rate, monthly recurring revenue, and refunds. Moreover, there is a live broadcast of recent transactions next to the dashboard that includes failed transactions, upgrades, and churned clients.Sign up for a Free Baremetrics Trial to start tracking your earnings in real-time.\n"

      "Understanding Purchase Cycles.\n",
      "Most businesses are aware their customers go through different phases before they reach a decision. Very broadly, these phases are known as the Purchase cycle. This article will dive into what a purchase cycle is and how to use this understanding to your advantage.Understanding how your customers make a purchase and coordinating your marketing, pricing, and sales efforts accordingly can be the key to accelerating your conversion rate (and driving costs down). If you want to get better analysis on your purchase cycles, Baremetrics has several analysis tools you can implement across the entire purchase cycle to close more deals. Your purchasing cycle (sometimes called the procurement cycle or procure-to-pay cycle) is the process a customer goes through to order, obtain and pay for your services to meet their needs. There is a subtle but significant difference between a purchase and a sales cycle, mainly for companies operating in a complex or competitive sales environment. Your Sales Cycle is the company's approach to move deals or prospective customers through your internal pipeline and process to close the sale. The flow might start by looking at a lead, qualifying a lead for marketing, qualifying the lead for sales, conducting a need analysis, submitting a pitch or proposal, negotiating, and closing. You could say that the sales cycle looks at the sale from the company's perspective and your purchase cycle looks at the sales process from the customer's perspective. The purchase or buying cycle looks at everything a customer needs to know at every step of their journey to make a purchase decision. The customer may start by acknowledging they are not satisfied and start looking for solutions online. They start evaluating different companies based on what they've found and eventually settle on a provider. The purchasing cycle is marketing-and-sales-led, whereas the sales cycle is focused on internal processes. Companies must understand both the sales cycle and the purchase cycle to close deals faster. Even a highly successful business doesn't convert every single prospect they are trying to win over. Some prospects drag their feet for years; others will never make a purchase,  or instead they’ll sign on with a competitor. While we won't avoid customers dropping from the sales funnel altogether, we can try to understand their motivation for closing or not closing and use our marketing and sales teams to improve our chances of closing the loop. Taking a step back and evaluating your communication and your product and service from the customers' perspective is an invaluable exercise for any organization. Are you driving a lot of qualified traffic, but those leads never pan out? Tweaking your communication or driving traffic to a page with a hard-selling message can change everything! Traffic to your webpage is likely in the consideration phase, with prospects not entirely convinced you can solve their needs. Alternatively, you might find that your site converts every single lead it gets, but said leads are few and far between. Hence, you should start investing in building awareness and widening your audience pool with your marketing efforts. Remember: The purchase cycle is about concentrating your efforts on the right channel. When customers try to understand their problems or needs, they do not want pushy salespeople to approach them. And when they are ready to make a purchase, they just want to know the price and the implementation process. When you know what your customers need at every stage, you can match your sales and communication approach to match their needs. The purchase cycle isn't only about converting new customers, however. There should also be a focus on retaining and upselling to existing customers so that you can capture and hold a larger share of those consumers over time. Retention and cancellation analysis can grow your profits dramatically. According to HBR, understanding which customers to keep (and which ones to let go) can increase your profits by 25-95%. Do you know who your most valuable customers are? If not, try conducting a Customer Lifetime Value analysis using Baremetrics. The most valuable customers form the backbone of your organization and need to be retained to ensure your growth and profitability. Let's start by looking at most customers' patterns when contemplating completing a purchase or investing in a SaaS service. Almost all purchase cycles start with awareness. Buyers realize they need something and recognize that your brand can be a potential solution. At least a portion of your marketing budget is probably geared towards reaching customers with brand messages to stimulate awareness and offer solutions. How do you achieve that?By employing your company blog, social media, or other forms of promotion and advertising to drive awareness. Yet, it might not be worth going after every lead in this stage. So, if you spend more bringing in new customers than they bring in, you may want to adjust your tactics! Comparing your acquisition cost and the average revenue per customer gives you greater insight. During this stage, the buyer is considering all their options to solve their problem. Your focus needs to be on conveying the benefits of your solution. Some customers want scalability; others prefer a low-cost solution. Segmenting customers and determining what their most important needs are is very important at this particular stage.  Your customer is convinced they need a product to solve their problem or meet their needs, but they haven't decided which one. You'll need to spend your efforts positioning yourself against competitors in white papers, press releases, and case studies. Your customer may have a few providers in mind, and if your solution, price, and promotions have swayed them, they'll choose you over any competitor. Keeping an eye on business coming in is essential, but you need to track how quickly they churn. If customers eagerly sign on but then abandon ship after a free trial or a few months of usage, you either need to improve your retention efforts or not qualify your leads properly. Not all purchase cycles go beyond the purchase phase, but if you are a SaaS business (or any other business with a recurring revenue model), you can't afford to skip this step. You need to make sure you measure your retention rates and customer satisfaction levels long after the deal is closed to upsell and keep your monthly recurring revenue rate at a healthy level. You may have heard the phrase, \"What gets measured, gets managed.\" While we can make many assumptions about customers and what works (or doesn't work), we must take a data-driven approach to realize the benefits of mapping the purchasing cycle. Here are a few of the metrics you need to know to manage your purchase cycle from start to finish: Ultimately, you won't know if your marketing efforts are successful if you aren't measuring the number of new customers coming in. You also need to see whether or not you are successful in upselling your existing customers. Previously, we've discussed that some customers are more valuable than others because of the size of their contribution to your bottom line. However, other customers may not even be worth pursuing at all. You need to know the lifetime value (LTV) of each customer so that you know where your retention efforts should be concentrated. With Baremetrics, you can view LTV at a glance. On top of this, you can also use helpful segmentation and profile tools to determine which customers you should actively pursue based on historical conversion and LTV data. You must become very familiar with the average acquisition cost to ensure that your marketing costs don’t exceed the money your campaigns generate. Do your customers leave after a free trial or downgrade within a few weeks of signing on? These are warning signs that you're pursuing the wrong customers or failing to onboard them properly once you've closed a deal. Customers need to see value in your product long after they've signed on. Your churn rate and downgrade rates should be carefully measured to ensure your strategies are paying off. You can use Baremetrics' cancellation insights tool to determine why your customers are leaving and adjust your strategy accordingly. Now, consider how many customers are enough? What should I be aiming for? Is my churn rate normal? The only way to know is by comparing yourself to other similar businesses. You can use Baremetrics' benchmarking tool to find out if you are hitting or exceeding the mark. Tailoring your sales and marketing efforts according to the purchase cycle is critically important, but it's not possible to accurately implement and measure a purchase cycle strategy without data insights. Sign up for a free 14-day trial with Baremetrics to implement your new strategy today, equipped with all the insights you need to measure your success. \n"

      "How to Increase LTV for E-commerce Businesses.\n",
      "What journey does a person pass to become your customer? Visitors go to your online store and get acquainted with your products. Sometimes they add items to the cart and turn into leads.Then they make a purchase and become your customers. And is that all? No, the interaction with the customer goes beyond one sale.What do you do next, you ask? You need to build a long-term relationship with the client and do it with the maximum benefit to the business.You need to build a long-term relationship with the client, spanning many communication and commerce channels, and you need do it in a way that drives maximum benefit to the business. You know their preferences, habits, and data. Therefore, you save your budget and make profit easier.How do you know how much you earn per customer? That’s where the customer lifetime value comes into play. LTV, or CLV, is the predicted amount a customer will spend on your product or service while they’re your customer.The logic behind this metric is simple. The higher the customer value, the more money you make.But how do you improve these numbers? In this article, I will talk about six ways how an e-commerce business can improve LTV.This metric is one of the critical performance criteria for the entire enterprise, especially in B2B sales or e-commerce. Is long-term cooperation effective? What types of customers respond best to your message?The lifetime value of your customers can assist in the following spheres:Optimizing marketing costsForecasting incomeIdentifying effective and ineffective acquisition channelsSegmenting your customer base by LTV for a more personalized experienceSpecifying the most loyal segment of customers with high LTV to optimize advertising campaigns and attract a similar target audienceCompanies calculate LTV in different ways. But all the formulas entail assessing how long each customer is expected to stay with your firm and how much money they will contribute. Before we start, let’s clear up some other connected metrics.One of them is ARPU. ARPU is the average profit from one client for some time period (for example, a month or quarter).How can you calculate it? You need to divide your regular income by the number of clients.Let’s say your income was $ 21,000 last month. And you had 15 clients. So, ARPU will be equal to 1400.Another term you need to understand is the churn rate. Suppose a person subscribed to your service. But they decide to undo it after some time.So, the number of customers or subscribers who stop using your service during a given time period is the churn rate.Baremetrics makes your LTV measurement task easier. You can see this indicator on a graph to compare growth or decline trends and take action to improve them. You can also analyze plans and periods when your marketing efforts led to LTV alterations.You can utilize several marketing practices and tools to ensure long-term and fruitful cooperation between the company and customers. Most of them increase the following indicators:Customer lifetimeRepeat purchase frequencyAverage checkBy increasing even one of them, lifetime value can also grow. Let’s look at six compelling cases.Push notifications are pop-ups on the device screen about important events. They are of two types:BrowserMobileHere are some benefits of push notifications:This tool is similar to email marketing because you also deliver your messages to subscribers. But an Internet user doesn’t need to give contact information to receive a web push. Instead, you need to confirm your consent. The second significant benefit is that such notifications automatically appear in the recipient’s browser window or mobile screen. As a result, there’s a far better chance they’ll read them.To receive mobile push notifications, a person needs to install the brand’s mobile app. However, modern technologies take the next step and bring opportunities to get notifications without installing an application. Such solutions are, for instance, progressive web apps (or PWAs for short).How are PWAs similar to native apps? They both have frictionless UX, support push notifications, and can work offline.But at the same time, the user doesn’t need to overload the phone memory and download the app from the marketplace. Instead, you add the PWA’s shortcut to your home screen from the browser. One of them is the Bloomique online store. To add a bookmark, you need to tap the “Add to Home Screen” button in the browser settings, as in the screenshot below.After that, you can use the progressive web app and subscribe to notifications.If you want to see what more progressive web apps are like, here are well-built Magento PWA examples. A newsletter is the leading marketing communication channel between a company and its customers. The main reason for this is that it’s profitable. According to some figures, email marketing brings a $42 return on investment for every $1 you spend. And it outperforms any other type of marketing, digital or not.Many online stores offer to subscribe to the newsletter even before the visitor buys something. And usually, they get a discount for this.For example, take a look at the screenshot of the Coco Reef website below. You can enter your email and buy goods 15% cheaper.The client interacts with your brand and leaves contact information that you can use for the same purposes as push notifications, such as:Announce about discounts and promotional offers to attract additional salesKeep audience’s attention to the brand by sending news and valuable contentSend surveys and track inactive segments of the target audienceEncourage repeat purchases.For example, Edible Arrangements does this in their emails. I made an order and didn’t buy for a while. The company sent me an email and offered a discount promotional code for purchases over $69. As they say, it’s how they welcome you back.Why is email marketing so effective? Because you have an audience of subscribers who are interested in your product. And since it’s much easier to buy something from a company you already know or constantly see in newsletters, your subscribers become repeat buyers.The idea is straightforward but effective. You define what unites your customers and, at the same time, sets them apart from the rest.But how can you do it? You need to collect and analyze data to understand your audience better.First of all, you should divide your customers into groups by common characteristics, such as:Geography and languageGenderAge Some channels even allow you to customize impressions for people who have a birthday on a particular dayInterestsIncome levelBehaviorThis includes what people were looking for, interested in, products or services they viewed, pages they visited, etc.Device or browserWhether or not they’ve previously browsed your siteUsing this information, you can compose a customer profile. It will make advertising and any other type of communication more personalized.How will it help your sales? You’ll create a more effective unique selling proposition.For example, study this ad from the Vans online store. I visited their website and searched for shoes. When I browse the Internet, the Vans ads chase me on other websites, so I see these recommendations.How does it work? I’ve expressed interest in some products in one way or another. So I’m more eager to buy them than those who haven’t been to the site.Another way to retain customers is loyalty programs. They encourage people to make orders more often as they’ve already experienced your services. That is you offer additional benefits for every repeat purchase a customer makes. Here is how you can achieve it:accumulative bonus systems;discounts for regular customers;unique offers after a certain period of cooperation.Your audience becomes more loyal to the brand with each new order, being less likely to leave for competitors.For example, Freshly Picked tells about their rewards program and perks in their email newsletters, as seen in the screenshot below.Cross-selling allows you to increase the average order value. Let’s say a customer buys a product.Think about what you can offer them to complement the purchase. Will it be a discount? Or a related product? For example, when a person buys a bed, offer them bedding or a bedside table.Where can you create a cross-sell section? You can recommend products as follows:on the product or service page;on the checkout page;in a newsletter after ordering a product.A screenshot below is an illustration of the Ulla Johnson product page. Choosing a dress, you see a section with goods complementing the image, as on the model. Don’t let your customers forget about you. How can you draw their attention? Keep them engaged using social media as part of your customer retention strategy.When people share their positive experiences with your brand, thank them for their kind words. If there's any issues, you need to be the first to address them.Share your customer reviews. It will improve your image and strengthen your existing and potential clients’ confidence.You can also improve CLV by showcasing new products, offers, and brand news.Sharing user-generated content helps too. Here is an example of UGC on the official Ulster Weavers Instagram account. The company asks people to tag their posts with #ulsterweavers to appear on the feed.How will understanding the lifetime value help you? The LTV metric shows how much money a customer will bring to your company. Your marketing department will know how much it costs to acquire and retain customers, which will help you get your marketing campaigns on track.As a result, you can make informed decisions leading to increased return on marketing investments. By personalizing your offerings, employing email marketing, and using push notifications you’ll increase repeat sales and expand the loyal audience segment.\n"

      "ProfitWell vs. Baremetrics.\n",
      "For a SaaS business to survive, it needs to track its business data. For a SaaS business to thrive, it needs to deeply understand what the business metrics mean for the state of the business.It is no wonder that so many companies choose to use a business metrics dashboard to help with data visualization and making insights. The skills to manipulate data are lacking at many companies and too expensive to acquire. That leaves you with one question: Can I get a product to do this business metrics analysis for me?We’ve dissected the Baremetrics vs. Stripe debate, as well as Stripe vs. Braintree, Chargebee, Chargify, Gumroad, PayPal, Recurly,  Shopify, Zuora, and ProfitWell. We’ve compared Chargebee to Recurly and Zuora. We’ve even compared Recurly to Chargify and Zuora.Now, in this ongoing series of comparisons, we discuss two of the best subscription analytics dashboards for SaaS: Baremetrics vs. ProfitWell.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more, directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources and start seeing all of your revenue on a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.ProfitWell is a SaaS enterprise focused on the B2C and B2B markets. It is actually an expansion of the original company, Price Intelligently. With a focus on helping other SaaS companies, ProfitWell offers three products:ProfitWell’s Metrics: This is a revenue metrics tracking product.Proftwell’s Retain: This is designed to reduce involuntary churn due to credit card failures.ProfitWell’s Recognized: This helps you to know when you can recognize your revenue.Baremetrics and ProfitWell have similar goals: they both aim to help SaaS companies, new and established, maximize their revenue stream. However, there are some key differences, from how they integrate with payment processing companies to how they present your data.Although by no means exhaustive, let’s look at some of the ways Baremetrics and ProfitWell differ:The basic ProfitWell product is free, and then ProfitWell charges for the use of the expansion products. Baremetrics charges only one fee for everything, where the fee is on a sliding scale depending on your MRR.  If you are using ProfitWell, and you want to start using the churn prevention and revenue recognition products, you might need to start paying a lot of money to get access to them. With Baremetrics, you already have access to the churn prevention, cancellation insights, customer insights, and forecasting tools all within your all-in-one low fee. ProfitWell has integrations with Zuora, Chargebee, and PayPal, while Baremetrics integrates with Chargify and Stripe. While Baremetrics does not officially integrate with PayPal, many Baremetrics users still import and analyze PayPal and Chargebee data via the Baremetrics API. The ProfitWell UI and design is rather bland and unintuitive. Contrary to this, Baremetrics has a lively and intricate UI and design that makes it easy to spot needed information and understand what the data is showing—even for novice data scientists. Go ahead and play with the Baremetrics Demo account! ProfitWell vs. Baremetrics: The clear, modern, easy-to-read Baremetrics interface above vs. the cluttered and dated interface of ProfitWell below. On the Baremetrics dashboard, the information you need jumps out at you.Both ProfitWell and Baremetrics have dunning tools, but ProfitWell Retain’s dunning emails are not customizable, whereas Baremetrics Recover’s dunning emails are fully customizable. With Baremetrics you can add your own branding, sentences, voice, buttons, and more to your dunning emails. Dunning emails are an effective method for recovering failed payments. However, with Recover you can go further by including in-app reminders for customers to update their billing information. In Recover, you can make it so that, when customers log in to your software, they’ll see a pop-up asking them to update their billing information.With Recover, you can take one more step by using the in-app callout message:To do so, copy and paste our JavaScript code snippet and choose how many days you want users to have access before enabling the paywall to force a payment method update.The settings are found using the steps: Recover → Settings → Credit Card form → callout.Baremetrics has many features that you cannot find on ProfitWell. This includes: Cancellation InsightsSegmentationBenchmarksAnnotationsTrend LinesCustomer Profile AugmentationBaremetrics has some clear advantages. Let’s take a look at a few of them now.You are probably looking for more features that help you act on your data and analytics. With intuitive features that help you understand the data, such as Annotations and Trend Lines, Baremetrics doesn’t just visualize your data, but also gives you the insights needed to forecast the future.Baremetrics wins the beauty contest, and ultimately that helps keep you focused. Important information immediately pops out on the Baremetrics dashboard. This is one of the most common positive feedbacks we get from customers—the look and feel keeps them using the service, which means they get more out of the features.You want features that help you strategize. With Cancellation Insights, Forecasting, Benchmarks, Annotations, and Trend Lines, Baremetrics offers all the tools needed to plan, act, and assess.You want to customize your dunning emails. Dunning emails are always a drag, and customized emails are needed to minimize your dunning—a feature offered by Baremetrics.You’re not happy with Retain's performance or Retain's pricing structure. With Recover, Baremetrics gives you more for less.Setting up a Baremetrics account is simple.Baremetrics offers 26 metrics that are accurate and easy to access.Although Baremetrics is a robust platform with many strengths over ProfitWell, there are some situations where Baremetrics isn’t the right choice. While Baremetrics management and development staff are always listening to users and working diligently to provide high value-add features and remove pain points, the following are a couple concerns we’ve heard.SaaS companies are very price-sensitive, especially when trying to bootstrap their business, and would prefer not to pay for metrics at all. When considering price, most Baremetrics customers tend to pay substantially less at Baremetrics than they would be paying if they were using the same features at ProfitWell. When it comes to getting the most for your bootstrapped business, definitely use Baremetrics. But if you’re looking to get minimal tracking for free, use ProfitWell.The customer wants to integrate with payment providers like Zuora and PayPal.ProfitWell wins over Baremetrics for Zuora, but the debate is still ongoing for PayPal. Baremetrics had a leading PayPal integration for a long time prior to the Shopify Partners API going live. At the moment, the Baremetrics team is building out a new Shopify Integration that will give ProfitWell a run for their money.Most customers choose Baremetrics over ProfitWell for the same few reasons. Baremetrics allows you to go much more in-depth with your metrics and analytics, comparing plans, segments, cohorts, benchmarks, and getting detailed breakdowns of what's happening each day. Baremetrics customers also like the design and UI much better, which makes sense since you use the tool every day. Baremetrics also offers some more features that allow you to act on your data, like Cancellation Insights for reducing churn and reactivating customers and Recover with customizable email and in-app dunning. We're constantly building new features and improvements, and we think you'll find we're always making the tools better for you.No, thanks to our fantastic engineering team, Baremetrics doesn’t experience any frequent or major outages. Our uptime is superb now, and we have a well-equipped team to handle any and all issues. Baremetrics is just as reliable as, if not more reliable than, any other analytics product out there.While ProfitWell says that they're more accurate, the reality is that we're all using the same logic and calculations, so there's no way that they could be more accurate than Baremetrics. There are some discrepancies in methodologies for calculating certain metrics, but we're both accurate solutions.Something to be aware of is that your system may not be fully set up or optimized. Before declaring a clear winner, give an honest look at your original set up and see if there are low-hanging fruit that ProfitWell is capitalizing on. There's really no magic or secret-sauce to recovery. Baremetrics’ Recover product has all the same features and amenities, with even more customization. Work with us on your account and we'd be happy to help you improve your recovery rate.Yes, loads of them! One of the lesser-known features of the dashboard is Annotations. Annotations allow you to add little notes to all your charts so that you can quickly see how trends change from various specific points in time. Annotations can be anything relevant to your business. Here are some examples: You’ve changed pricesStarted a new marketing campaignA new competitor entered the marketYou’ve added a new pricing tier, Any other relevant moment in time Seeing whether these moments represent change points can drastically improve your trend analysis. If they help, you will know when it’s time to double down. If they don’t, you can easily see that you need to try something different. To use Annotation, simply click on the point in time where something has happened (top left), add in an evocative comment (top right), and then later on you can easily reference trend changes from that point in time (bottom). Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data so that you always know how much cash you have on hand, which clients have paid, and who you still owe services to. When you have many clients, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you. Baremetrics can even monitor your SaaS quick ratio so you know immediately if your accounts receivables are getting out of control. It can even help make sure you collect on delinquent accounts. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.\n"

      "What Is Working Capital?.\n",
      "Working capital is the difference between a company’s current assets and its current liabilities. It is sometimes referred to as net working capital, and it is one of the measures of a company’s liquidity. You can find all the information you need to calculate working capital on the balance sheet.In this article, we are going to explain current assets, current liabilities, and how to calculate working capital. We’ll look into why working capital is important, what liquidity means, and some related measures such as the quick ratio and the current ratio. While the equations are all fairly simple, finding the data to calculate all of these metrics is not.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data so that you always know how much cash you have on hand, which clients have paid, and who you still owe services to.When you have many clients, some are subscribed on an annual basis while others are monthly, with multiple tiers and various add-ons. This makes it difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Check out what the MRR dashboard looks like right here:Baremetrics can monitor your SaaS quick ratio. It can even help make sure you collect on delinquent accounts. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.Current assets include basically everything that is currently cash or will be turned into cash within a year.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash can be anything from notes in your petty cash to the balance of your checking account. Cash equivalents are those items that can be turned into cash immediately, such as marketable securities (i.e., stocks and bonds).Accounts Receivable: This particular journal is only used under the accrual accounting system and not the cash accounting system. Accounts receivable includes the revenue that your company has recognized but not yet collected. As you receive payments for the services you have already provided, this account will decrease while your cash account will increase.Inventory: Inventory includes all supplies on hand to produce products for sale as well as the products ready to be sold. Many SaaS businesses have zero inventory. Current liabilities are the debts you owe that must be paid within the next year. For a SaaS business, the deferred revenue category is particularly important. Accounts Payable: Along with accounts receivable, accounts payable are only used in the accrual accounting system. These are expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid for, such as the electricity bill sitting on your desk or invoiced services that you do not need to pay immediately.Current Debt/Notes Payable: These are the debts you need to pay completely within a year.Current Portion of Long-Term Debt: Some companies separate out the part of long-term debt that needs to be paid within the following year. For example, your mortgage might be 25 years long, but the current portion includes all the payments you’ll make over the next year.Deferred Revenue: Counterintuitively, if you have collected money for services that have not yet been rendered, this is a liability because you owe the client for those services.The working capital formula is very simple: Working Capital = Current Assets – Current LiabilitiesYou essentially tally up all of your current assets and then subtract all of your current liabilities.Liquidity refers to the availability of cash or cash equivalents on hand for planned and sudden expenses. Generally, high liquidity is considered safer as you have the agility to dodge unforeseen expenses as well as to jump on surprise opportunities.Indeed, there are two main indicators of whether a business will be able to survive: profitability and liquidity. As counterintuitive as it may be, a profitable company without sufficient liquidity is destined to fail, even though a not particularly profitable company with a strong positive liquidity can survive long enough to turn around its profitability. For more on this, take a look at our recent article on net cash flow.There are several ways to calculate liquidity. The current ratio and the quick ratio are calculated with the same information as working capital, which is found on the balance sheet.Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current LiabilitiesQuick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Investments + Accounts Receivable)/Current LiabilitiesWhile the current ratio uses all current assets and liabilities, the quick ratio removes inventory. This is because the assumption that inventory will be turned into cash within a year is based on the further assumption that the company will operate well and efficiently during that year. This could be a dangerous assumption, as markets change and inventory can then be stranded in warehouses until placed on deep discounts.The net cash flow takes information from the statement of cash flow, which, in addition to the balance sheet discussed above, is one of the three main financial statements (with the income statement being the third).While the quick ratio, the current ratio, and working capital all measure the liquidity of a company at a point in time, the net cash flow shows how liquidity is changing over time.All of these measures have their limits. For example, having a high positive net cash flow might not always be a good thing. If that cash flow came from a massive new loan designed to keep the company afloat while patronage continues to decrease, then it is hardly a good thing.Similarly, a large negative cash flow might originate from the purchase of new equipment that will improve productivity and decrease long-term costs. SaaS companies that bring in revenue through a subscription model typically have high accounts receivable and/or deferred revenue. When this is the case, the current ratio, quick ratio, and working capital can all be skewed. Involuntary churn could mean the accounts receivable account is higher than the actual collectible revenue, which would make these measures overly optimistic. For this issue, Baremetrics Recover can help! Up to 9% of MRR is lost to failed payments, and Baremetrics has the tool to minimize this.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and stop losing revenue to failed payments now.Conversely, a very high deferred revenue account might make these measures less impressive, even though an essentially interest-free loan from clients is generally a benefit to the company.Another issue that is often overlooked when analysts rely too heavily on these measures is seasonality. For example, if you have a yearly campaign in December to push your monthly subscribers to buy annual subscriptions, then you’ll probably see a spike in your cash as well as deferred revenue during the first few months of the year.Similarly, if you give your employees large bonuses in summer, then you’ll need more cash on hand in the summer months to account for that higher payroll. Knowing the seasonality of your business will help in the interpretation of these measures.Finally, more is not always better in this case! If your working capital is consistently high, it might be an indication that you are not using your capital efficiently. It might be time to invest more in your future or to give more back to shareholders in the form of dividends. While not necessarily a better measure of liquidity, the SaaS quick ratio does provide unique, specific, and actionable information when analyzing the revenue data of your SaaS business. The information it provides is different from that of working capital, and it is worth the time to calculate the SaaS quick ratio for a better understanding of your company.The SaaS quick ratio is based on the different types of MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and is calculated as follows:As a general rule of thumb, a SaaS quick ratio of <1 indicates a present danger for your company as you are churning clients more quickly than you are attracting new ones. While a SaaS quick ratio of 1–4 indicates growth, the pace might be too slow to guarantee the longevity of your business. Generally, a SaaS quick ratio of >4 is a safe and comfortable growth trajectory.As easy as it is to calculate your SaaS quick ratio once you have the numbers, getting them is another question. Your SaaS company likely uses CRM and/or payment processing software, and the data required to compute all required MRR values can be all over the place. Integrating innovative software that can cull MRR values from CRM and payment processing systems is a valuable shortcut.Baremetrics monitors your SaaS quick ratio, computing everything from your company’s MRR as shown by your membership or subscription payments/upgrades to your monthly churn rates.

      "What Is Operating Income?.\n",
      "Operating income is essentially the money left over after you deduct all direct and indirect expenses from net revenue. It is one of the many totals that might be shown on the income statement, depending on the level of detail of the income statement. In this article, we will explain operating income and how it is calculated. We’ll also look at what is and is not included in the calculation, how it differs from other totals, and why it is important. Once you get a handle on these traditional measures of profitability, check out Baremetrics to get your SaaS metrics.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Check out what the MRR graph looks like right here:Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Operating Income = Gross Profit – Operating ExpensesGross margin is how much money is left over when you deduct the cost of goods sold (COGS) from net revenue:Net revenue is how much revenue is left over after you remove returns, refunds, discounts, etc. from revenue:So what does all this mean? Operating income is simply the amount of money you have made after all direct and indirect expenses are deducted. Direct costs are expenses that are directly related to the sale of a product or service. These expenses are usually grouped together as COGS and reported separately from other expenses on the income statement directly following revenue. Indirect costs are the expenses used to run the larger business operations and therefore usually called operating expenses. These include cash expenses, as such rent, utilities, and payroll, as well as non-operating expenses, namely depreciation and amortization (for tangible and intangible assets, respectively). However, note that operating income does not include taxes or interest, which is why it is often confused with EBIT discussed below.While there are other ways to calculate operating income, let’s get some definitions down first to make them more understandable.Operating income is calculated with three main components. The first is net revenue.Revenue (or Sales): Revenue is found at the very top of the income statement. It is the sum of all money earned by the company during its core business processes. For a SaaS subscription business, this would include all the money earned from monthly and annual subscriptions that occurred during the period covered by the income statement, as well as add-ons, usage fees, etc.Net Revenue: From revenue (sometimes called gross revenue) there are certain deductions that are not exactly expenses and come before expenses are listed on the income statement. These deductions include discounts offered to customers or refunds from canceled services or defective products. Once these deductions have been made, the remaining value is the net revenue.The other two items are the expenses deducted from the net revenue: COGS and operating expenses.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): COGS commonly follows the revenue on the income statement. Net revenue minus COGS is gross margin. COGS is the total cost of a company’s products or services, and it is also referred to as the cost incurred to manufacture goods or services. COGS only includes the direct costs of producing your service.Operating Expenses: These are the expenses generated by a company’s core business activities. Operating expenses include payroll, utilities, rent, pension contributions, and sales commission.Since we are going compare operating income to a couple other measures of a company’s profitability below, let’s add a few more definitions here: Depreciation: Depreciation is a method for spreading the cost of a long-term tangible asset over its useful life. Depreciable assets can include buildings, equipment, office furniture, vehicles, land, and machinery. Note that which assets can be depreciated depends on local tax codes. Amortization: Amortization is a system for spreading the cost of an intangible asset over the course of its useful life. Amortizable assets can include patents and trademarks, franchise agreements, proprietary processes, and the cost of issuing bonds to raise capital.Taxes: Taxes are calculated based on a business’s revenue less all tax-deductible expenses. Interest: The interest expense is the amount of money spent to service a loan. Conversely, a company may receive interest on the money they have in the bank. Gains: Gains are the results of positive financial events not related to the company’s core activities. Gains indicate the amount of money gained by the company from one-off events. They can include the sale of an operating segment. For example, Baremetrics recently sold Intros for $100,000. Gains can also come from selling off unproductive assets or assets that have reached the end of their useful life such as old vehicles, unused land, etc. Losses: Losses are the results of negative financial events not related to the company’s core activities. Losses indicate the amount of money the company lost from such one-off events as settlement of a lawsuit or a loss due to a stock trade.With these further definitions down, we can now compare operating income to several other totals you might find on the income statement. However, for a SaaS business, this is only the start of your financial analysis. Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly on your Baremetrics dashboard.

Gross Profit Margin: Gross profit margin is the gross profit turned into a ratio or percentage.Note that, to show this as a percentage, as is common, you can multiply the ratio by 100.EBIT (or Operating Earnings): This is a non-GAAP measure of a company’s financial performance. It tells you how much the company has made before subtracting interest and taxes. It differs from operating income because it includes all the gains and losses, i.e., non-operating profit and expenses, respectively, as well.To see the difference more clearly, look at this comparison equation:Operating income = Operating Revenue – Operating Expenses = EBIT – Non-Operating Profit + Non-Operating ExpensesEBITDA: This is another non-GAAP measure of profitability. In addition to not including interest and taxes, EBITDA subtracts non-cash expenses, i.e., depreciation and amortization, as well. This can give you an idea of the true profitability of the period since depreciation and amortization are accounting expenses only.EBITDA = Net income – (Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization)EBIT = Net income + Interest + Taxes = EBITDA – (Depreciation + Amortization)All of these different measures are important. They tell you different things about your company, but they are also used by all the outside business people you deal with while building, running, and expanding your company. Accountants, auditors, potential investors, bankers, tax authorities, etc. will be interested in some or all of these measures when assessing the health of your business, how much you owe in taxes, your creditworthiness, or how to evaluate the value of your company for an investment.Let’s see if we can calculate all of these different measures based on the information in the table below (following conventions, the negative numbers are in brackets for clarity):ItemValueItemValueRevenue20,000Amortization(300)Returns, Refunds, and Discounts(1,000)Interest Paid(500)Costs of Goods Sold(4,000)Taxes(3,000)Rent(1,000)Sale of Platform10,000Payroll(2,000)Settlement of Lawsuit(5,000)Depreciation(1,000)Let’s start from the top with net revenue. We can see that revenue is $20,000 and the returns, refunds, and discounts total $1,000. That gives us a net revenue of $19,000.With the COGS of $4,000, we can get a gross profit of $15,000. As a percentage, this leaves us with a very robust gross profit margin of approximately 79%.Next, we need to total up all the expenses (excluding interest and taxes) to get the total indirect expenses of $4,300. Subtracting this value from the gross profit gives us and operating income of $10,700. Adding in the gains and losses, shown as the sale of a platform and settlement of a lawsuit, respectively, we can get an EBIT of $15,700.If we then remove the depreciation and amortization, we are left with an EBITDA of $17,000.Finally, we can sum up everything to get a net income of $12,200.In a SaaS business, these measures are not enough. There are many other metrics that need to be tracked.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.\n"

      "What Is Net Cash Flow?.\n",
      "Simply put, the net cash flow is all the money coming in minus all the money going out. This metric is usually surfaced on your statement of cash flow.The statement of cash flow summarizes all of the money entering and exiting the company. This is used to calculate the net cash flow. It is one of the three main financial statements with the balance sheet and income statement. While the balance sheet summarizes the assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity of the company at a moment in time, the income statement summarizes the revenue and expenses over a specified period of time to calculate the net profit of the company.Similar to the income statement, the statement of cash flow is presented for a period of time. It separates the cash flows into those from operating activities, financial activities, and investing activities. More fundamentally, they are divided into inflows and outflows.Your net cash flow is a particularly important metric to measure in a SaaS because it doesn’t always align with when revenue enters the company or expenses exit the company.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your cash flows. When you have many clients, some are subscribed on an annual basis while others monthly, with multiple tiers and various add-ons, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR, ARR, LTV, and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.You can sign up for a Free Baremetrics Trial to start tracking your cash flow in real-time.There are two main equations for calculating net cash flow. They combine into a single, Voltron-esque equation that summarizes the entire statement of cash flows.The first two net cash flow equations are:(2) Net Cash Flow = Total Cash Inflows – Total Cash OutflowsThe first one is a summary of the different types of cash flow, which we will look at in the next section, while the second simply says that money comes and goes, and so we need to watch how much is going relative to how much is coming.These combine into one big equation that is essentially the statement of cash flows:To calculate your net cash flow, regardless of the equation chosen, you will need to know your cash inflows and cash outflows. Let’s look at some examples.Cash inflows: Customer payments, sale of goods or services, loan receipts, cash dividends, interest earned, fixed asset sales, supplier and vendor refunds, grants, third-party funding, lawsuit settlements, insurance claims, equipment sales, and property sales.Cash outflows: Payroll, supplier and vendor payments, taxes, fees, fines, licenses, interest paid, fuel and transportation costs, rent, utilities, marketing and advertising spend, debt payments, equity investment, stock buybacks, shareholder payout, and property purchase.Net cash flow is comprised of three categories:Operating activities: Operating activities generate cash flows from your business’s general operations, including expenditures for administrative expenses and receipts from customers.Financial activities: Financial activities generate cash flows through bonds, debt, and stocks, for example cash used to pay off debt or cash dispersed as dividends.Investing activities: Investing activities generate cash flows related to major purchases or sales that change the long-term structure of the company, for example the purchase of new equipment or the sale of a platform outside of your core business plan. (Check out this article about how Baremetrics sold Intros for $100,000.)Importantly, there are cash inflows and cash outflows with all three categories.While net cash flow is the most common type of cash flow to discuss, some of the other forms of cash flow include operating cash flow, free cash flow, and free cash flow to equity.Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow indicates the amount of cash being generated by a business from its normal operating activities. One of the major differences between operating cash flow and net cash flow is that operating cash flow does not include capital expenditures (the investments made to buy and maintain fixed assets).Note that this is the only one of these three other cash flow types that is a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)-approved metric.While the current ratio and quick ratio are measures of your company’s liquidity, the net cash flow is an indication of how your liquidity is changing over time. Since cash troubles usually precede other financial troubles, keeping track of your cash position is extremely important to ensuring you remain a viable and agile company.Indeed, there are two main indicators of whether a business will be able to survive: profitability and cash flow. As counterintuitive as it may be, a profitable company without sufficient cash flow is destined to fail, even though a not particularly profitable company with a strong positive cash flow can survive long enough to turn around its profitability.How does this happen? Well, one of the major causes of a profitable company not maintaining a good cash flow is a failure to timely collect on accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are all the revenue you have earned from your clients but not yet collected. Unfortunately, not all accounts receivable are collectable, and the longer you wait, the less likely it is that you will collect that money owed.One of the major reasons this happens is through credit card failures. Dunning is an immensely important part of any company, and stopping involuntary churn is one of the best things you can do for your company today. It can stop a momentary cash flow issue from ruining the long-term profitability of your company. Up to 9% of your MRR is at risk from failed payments. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics Recover offers you an exceptional dunning tool to make sure you collect your accounts receivable.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.No individual business metric is perfect, and that includes net cash flow. The general consensus in business is “having more cash on hand is better”, but that is not always the case.For example, if a company has a sudden large positive net cash flow because they took on a new debt, that might not be the best indicator of good financial health. While debt isn’t bad per se, the reason the company has taken on debt and the cost of that debt are important to know when gauging whether this cash inflow will be good for the business or a leading signal of its imminent demise.Conversely, a large investment activities outflow may increase the capacity of a company to produce a product and be a sign of healthy growth.Other cash outflows that might be signs of a healthy company include an increased dividend payment or the early repayment of a debt with unfavorable terms.Although a company’s cash flow position is important, it cannot be used to evaluate the overall health of a company in a bubble. Especially for a SaaS company, there are many other metrics that also need to be taken into consideration, such as MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), and churn.It is difficult to calculate your company’s net cash flow. You probably use a payment gateway—or several gateways depending on the nature of your business and/or the customers you target—and searching through all the data to confirm how much money has come in can be hard.Beyond difficult, it is time consuming and distracts you from other duties. This is compounded if you have multiple plan tiers, some customers paying monthly while others paying annually, as well as a variety of add-ons to boost your expansion MRR.Even before you get into the task of forecasting your revenue growth or net cash flow into the future, you need a platform that will bring in all that data from across your different platforms and present it in an easy-to-read way.Baremetrics monitors your SaaS quick ratio, computing everything from your company’s MRR as shown by your membership or subscription payments/upgrades to the monthly churn rate. It even keeps track of your payments so you can know your cash flow. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.\n"

      "Calculating Growth Rates in SaaS.\n",
      "Before people ever started calculating growth rates for economic activity, governments used the growth rate formula to determine population growth. Ever since then, calculating growth rates has become an essential tool for almost everything.In SaaS, you need to calculate the growth rate for a handful of different metrics. For example, you need to calculate the growth rates for monthly recurring revenue (MRR), active customers, average revenue per user (ARPU), and more. One easy way to do this is to use Baremetrics to calculate the growth rates for your SaaS metrics. Get on the Baremetrics free trial, and check out what it looks like!Here’s an example of calculating the ARPU growth rate with Baremetrics:You can see the ARPU growth rate automatically displayed in green under your ARPU amount.A growth rate is a term that describes the change (in percentages) of a variable over a specific period. For example, let’s look at growth rates for populations. A positive growth rate for a population would indicate there’s a higher rate of births, or a lower rate of deaths. The growth rate of a population would be written as a percentage change over a year. For example, the population of Tokyo grew by 0.1% over 2020. In this example, we could say that Tokyo grew from a population of 1,000,000 people on January 1st, 2020, to 1,001,000 people on January 1st 2021. A growth rate shows the percentage increase of a value, such as a population, over a given period of time.Growth rates can also be applied to personal finance. For example, the growth rate of our savings was 20% year over year. That means the amount of money we have saved this year is 20% more than last year.Growth rates are also popular when looking at how businesses grow or change. If you’re considering whether or not to invest money in a certain area of business, you might want to look at how that area of business is growing.With an understanding of a company's growth rate, investors can often predict future performance and make better investment decisions. For example, you might look at the revenue of the business. Is the amount of revenue increasing? If it is, that might be a good indicator of potential.For businesses, you can use Baremetrics to measure growth rates quickly. Check out the MRR growth rate here from a real Baremetrics dashboard:You can see all of the Baremetrics metrics in the live demo, or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial to start using it now!The Growth Rate formula is:Growth rate = ((End Value) - (Beginning Value)) / (Beginning Value) Since growth rate measures change over a specific time, values from one period (e.g., August) can be compared against calculated values from the previous period (i.e., July). In this case, values from August serve as the end value while values from July serve as the beginning value.You can have both positive growth rates and negative growth rates. If the growth rate is positive it indicates growth or expansion, if it’s negative it indicates contraction.Growth rates are calculated for different metrics for SaaS companies. The growth rate of active customers, for instance, differs from the growth rate of bookings in a SaaS business. The most important growth rates in SaaS include:Unlike the growth rate types for traditional companies, such as trailing growth rates or forward-looking rates, SaaS companies utilize the growth metrics listed above. The values from these metrics give SaaS businesses a hands-on understanding of their financial health and projections for future growth. Even better, these growth metrics can be weighed against industry benchmarks to analyze growth within the proper context.Growth rates are an essential yardstick in measuring your business’s profitability and sustainability. This measure helps all interested parties understand the speed at which a company is growing and helps leaders make projections for the future. With Baremetrics, you can get a bunch of growth rates for your metrics. Many companies commit the honest error of lumping their paying customers together with users on a free trial. When users have been lumped together in this way, these companies often measure the number of users, forgetting that there’s an important distinction between paying customers and customers on a free trial. Of course, all users are significant. Users on free trials may eventually become paying customers. Still, keep in mind that it’s the paying customers that keep the lights on. Knowing how your active customers are growing is a good indicator of your company’s health.  Here’s an example of monitoring the growing number of active subscriptions to your SaaS:The monthly recurring revenue is the total revenue gained from your business every month. One-off payments like setup fees or consultation fees are not part of the MRR. The revenue counted as part of the MRR is recurring payments, such as a monthly subscription.The Baremetrics MRR tracking shows you the growth rate of your monthly revenue. You’ll be able to compare MRR from different months and see if it’s increasing, decreasing, or just remaining constant. If you have a substantial decline in MRR, it could indicate that your customers are churning at a higher rate than usual. Do you need to increase your efforts at bringing new customers? A clear understanding of your sources of revenue and the data from your MRR can give you an added advantage in creating a growth strategy. You’ll also need to know what channels to persist on and which ones aren’t bringing much ROI. As you may already know, MRR is not an independent metric, it’s interconnected with other metrics that aim to give you a holistic view of the financial health of your business. With Baremetrics, you can keep an eye on your MRR and its interplay with other vital metrics.Churn rate is the percentage of revenue or customers lost within a given timeframe. The most essential type of churn include:Both customer and revenue churn show your losses in terms of customers and revenue. Churn is checked monthly, and it shows you how many customers you are losing from canceled subscriptions, while revenue churn shows you how much MRR you are losing from all the canceled subscriptions.Here is an example of the rate of change for churn:When your existing users bring in more revenue by upgrading to a higher plan or purchasing an add-on service from your business, the new revenue is the expansion MRR. You can also track this metric with Baremetrics.Some businesses build their user experience to encourage expansion MRR, like upgrading from a user plan to a team or group plan. If your company has made plans for expansion MRR, you can take advantage of the Baremetrics tool and see if your efforts are paying off. Baremetrics provides a dashboard to track your financial data and its interplay with several other business performance data. Your company’s financial data is essential for several reasons. It provides a glance as well as an in-depth look at the overall health of your business. Your internal team will also use your financial data to analyze business performance and determine whether tactics and strategies must be changed or improved. In addition to giving you clear insight into your financial information, Baremetrics shows you how your company performs against industry benchmarks.

      "Monitor Your Revenue Performance with Baremetrics.\n",
      "Revenue Performance Management (RPM) is when a company monitors its revenue performance, tracks how revenue is affected by strategic decisions, figures out revenue drivers, and then optimizes operations to drive revenue growth. RPM isn’t easy—and tracking all your metrics just makes a difficult job harder. Instead of relying on old spreadsheets and manually pulling data from many sources, you should try Baremetrics. Baremetrics tracks the 26 most important business metrics by connecting directly to your revenue streams.Don’t believe me? There’s a couple dozen companies that are happy to let you peek at all of their financials directly by showing you their Baremetrics dashboards publicly. Our friends at Friendly have even been kind enough to give us the details on how they grew their company from zero to $1,000 MRR in only three months. This is the power of RPM.RPM is a hallmark of highly performing companies. Without the systemized focus on pushing revenue up, companies can falter. In a growing economy, stagnant sales is a loss of market share and can lead to your company being deemed irrelevant. As we will see below, RPM requires special tools in the world of SaaS, and Baremetrics is the complete toolbox. From MRR and ARR, to churn and LTV, the 26 metrics offered by Baremetrics give you the granular data you need to maximize revenue performance.When it comes to revenue management, Baremetrics doesn’t do just metrics. Baremetrics also does cancellation prevention and churn prevention. This helps you keep MRR and receive MRR even when your customers’ payments fail. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription revenue now.RPM is a systematic process for identifying the drivers and impediments to revenue, precisely measuring them, and then making the changes that will maximize your marketing return on investment and sales growth.When we think of high performing companies, the first thought is “high profit”, which is maybe followed by “high revenue” and “low expenses.” In these terms, the SaaS paradigm isn’t so different from traditional businesses. But this is where the similarity ends. Indeed, SaaS businesses earn their revenue in different ways. They also have very different cost structures. Most of all, when they project their revenue, expenses, and profit into the future, they have a completely different understanding of what drives revenue and therefore what metrics need to be tracked.Traditional businesses rely on a never-ending parade of customers making one-off purchases. Of course, they hope to offer a good experience and get repeat customers, but the relationship building in SaaS goes well beyond a series of momentary meetings.To maintain a subscription revenue model, you spend all day focused on what your clients are doing, what they want to be doing, how you are fulfilling those desires, and the pain points in your software. While you also need to evangelize to expand your customer base, the core to your company’s success can be measured in how well you retain customers, the recurring value of your customers, the growth in revenue from current customers, and how long you can keep them subscribed. There are so many metrics you should be tracking to keep a handle on your revenue performance! For now, you can find everything you need to know to calculate MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), and LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) on the Baremetrics blog.See how Baremetrics does it right here:While SaaS expenses can be similar to those in traditional tech businesses, including payroll, rent, utilities licensing fees, and hosting fees, the drags on revenue performance can be quite different. In a SaaS business, you’ll probably obsess over two things: churn and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). While these aren’t precisely expenses that can appear on your income statement, they eat away at your revenue performance and need to be considered for successful RPM.CAC is how much it costs to bring in a single client. This includes attracting customers to your service and converting them into a paying customer. Specifically, you need to make sure your CAC remains below your LTV if you want to be profitable. Churn, on the other hand, is the loss of a customer. This is one of the important items when calculating your LTV, as the longer a customer lasts before churning, the more total revenue they will generate. While revenue in and expenses out remain the same, the metrics are different and the flows are different. This requires a new way of thinking about revenue performance and new tools to be utilized.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, including churn metrics.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Check out Baremetrics LTV and churn measurements right on your Baremetrics dashboard:Now that we have established what revenue performance is, why you need RPM, and how it differs for SaaS enterprises, let’s look at how you actually accomplish RPM.To measure, understand, and act on your revenue performance, follow this simple four-step plan. It goes without saying that this isn’t a one-and-done scheme but something that you do repeatedly, especially any time your market or services change.  This is the easiest step and the most crucial one, but it is also the most ignored process and least likely to be done successfully. Too many companies don’t collect data, don’t use the data they collect, or don’t collect the right data. This is simply because they don’t have the skills available in-house to do proper data collection and analysis.The data you need to collect can be split into two types: qualitative and quantitative.For the qualitative data, want to get as much information from as many of your clients as possible while not being obtrusive. If your onboarding process is onerous because you ask too many questions, you’ll probably find yourself with more abandoned carts. If you send too many emails asking for feedback, you’ll probably find your marketing messages going unopened.So, think about what is the core information you need to know, and what information can only come from the customers themselves. This can include what needs the company went in search of fulfilling, why they chose your service, what features they most use, what needs you aren’t fulfilling, and how much value you are adding to their business.For the quantitative data, you need to keep track of all the stats you can. This includes anything you can pull from your payment gateway, as well as all the metrics discussed above—CAC, LTV, MRR, ARR, and more. You can optimize your product and marketing based on the qualitative data collected directly from current and potential clients and then track how these changes affect your revenue performance using the quantitative data. This one is a lot tougher, and we have a dedicated article just on tracking and optimizing your funnel. The funnel concept is basically how you drive traffic—the right traffic—to your website and how your website persuades those visitors to convert to sign ups. Depending on your revenue model, you may also have a free trial or freemium step in your funnel where visitors convert to your free service and then need to be further nudged into seeing the value of the paid service.  Understanding your target customers and what they are searching for will help you attract not just more visitors but the right visitors. Seeing what features are the hooks will help you convert more visitors. To do this, you need to be tracking the right information, which leads to the next step. To understand your revenue performance, you need revenue metrics. These come in all sizes and each metric can help you optimize a different part of your revenue stream. This is where Baremetrics can really come in handy.Tracking your Visitors (V) and Conversion Rate (CR) will be the key to improving marketing.Your LTV and CAC are the primary metrics you need to set your top-level budgets.MRR and ARR, and importantly their change over time, are how you track growth and can grade the changes you are making. If they are static while you make big changes, then that effort isn’t paying off and you need to go back to the drawing board. Having the data at your fingertips, the metrics that go with it, and a general idea of how your funnel is operating (as well as how you want it to operate), it is now time to make more money. Whether you decide on an email campaign or to push your social media platform, from a new blog to working with influencers in your industry, communication is the word. You have the best guess of your audience, and now you need to find them and create a dialog. Track the progress as you venture more afield to keep augmenting your messaging. This will lead to improved revenue performance.Baremetrics not only provides all the revenue performance metrics you need to track but also publishes helpful guides so that you can understand those metrics and fully exploit them.Setting up your account is easy, and you can immediately see what you’ve been missing. For revenue performance management specifically, let’s talk a bit about one of the lesser-known features of the dashboard: Annotations. In a recent conversation with one of the developers, they mentioned how excited they were about Annotations, and we think you’ll agree! Especially for RPM, Annotations allow you to add little notes to all your charts so that you can quickly see how trends change from various specific points in time.Annotations can be anything—maybe you want to note when you’ve changed prices, started a new marketing campaign, a new competitor entered the market, you released a new pricing tier, and any other relevant moment in time. Seeing whether these moments represent change points can drastically improve your trend analysis. If they help, you know to double down. If they don’t, you can easily see that you need to try something different. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.\n"

      "What Is Accrual Accounting?.\n",
      "If you remember our discussion on bookkeeping (where you can find useful definitions of many of the terms used here), which discusses the difference between bookkeeping and accounting, accounting is similarly broken down into accrual accounting and cash accounting. Cash accounting is the simpler of the two. In cash accounting, you record all revenue and expenses when the cash enters and exits your checking account, respectively. This system is often preferred by smaller companies because it requires less expertise to implement. However, many tax authorities require certain kinds of companies, as well as those over a revenue threshold, to switch to the accrual accounting method.A basic accrual definition is that economic events are recognized when they occur instead of when the monetary transactions are performed. In the accrual accounting method, you record revenue when it is earned and expenses when they are incurred. This adds complexity, but, as we show below, it is well worth the added value of having a clearer image of your company.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business: MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.Check out all the information on the dashboards here:Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.In the accrual accounting method, revenue is accounted for when it is earned. This usually will happen before money changes hands, for example when a service is delivered to a customer with the reasonable expectation that money will be paid in the future. Similarly for expenses, they are recognized when they are incurred. This is done by following the matching principle. Accrual accounting entries require the use of accounts payable and accounts receivable journals, as well as a few others for deferred revenue and expenses, depreciation, etc. In the cash accounting method, revenues and expenses are recognized when cash is transferred. This is the system used by individuals when budgeting household expenses and by some small businesses.There are two main accrual accounting principles.This means that expenses should be matched to the revenue they generate and therefore be shifted into the period in which the revenue was earned instead of being recorded in the period they were paid for.For a subscription SaaS provider, this can mean breaking up the money received from an annual subscription into the monthly periods as the services are provided. This provides auditors with an apples-to-apples comparison of a company’s financial picture that is more transparent across industries. Accrual accounting provides companies with a more accurate picture of their financial health. Since accrual accounting leads to financial statements with all revenue recorded in the month it was earned (revenue recognition principle) and all expenses lined up with the revenue they generated (matching principles), it provides a far more accurate view of the current health of the company. Similarly, accrual accounting also allows for better forecasting. Since revenues and expenses are matched to each other and to the correct time period currently and going forward, it is far easier to see how your company’s financial position is changing over time and make strategic decisions based on the information.According to many tax authorities, SaaS companies must use the accrual accounting system, which stipulates that you record revenue when it is earned. In the case of a subscription revenue stream, this means when you have fulfilled your part of the service agreement. Consider the following two subscription revenue example scenarios to make this point clear. Scenario 1 Your company offers a discount to clients that pay their bill annually instead of monthly. You have 10 clients that opt for the discount. These invoices total $360,000. Since you will provide services to these clients for an entire year and your income statements are drafted monthly, U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) standards stipulate that you should move $30,000 at the end of each money into your revenue account and keep the unearned subscription revenue in a deferred revenue account as you have not yet earned the money.Scenario 2Your company bills clients at the end of the month for the services you’ve provided during the month. Most of your clients pay within the allowed time period, but some—due to their poor financial health, issues with the payment system, etc.—do not pay on time. In this case, you might be earning $30,000 at the end of each month, but you may not be receiving all of it until some days, weeks, or months later—or, unfortunately, sometimes not at all. In the first case, you have more cash on hand than your company has actually earned. In the second case, you have less cash on hand than you have earned, and you might not even receive all the money you have earned. The same is true for expenses, which must be recognized when they are incurred regardless of when the invoice is paid. This is done by matching the expenses to the revenue they generate where possible. When this is not easily possible, then either the systemic and rational allocation method or the immediate allocation method can be used. The former allocations expenses over the useful life of the product, whereas the latter recognizes the entire expense when purchased. Let’s consider a few example scenarios for when expenses should be recognized. Scenario 1You decide to advertise your new SaaS product on Facebook. You set a budget of $6000 to hit your targeted market over a 12-week period and pay the invoice. Since you draft monthly income statements, you divide the $6000 into three monthly expenses of $2000 and recognize them over the three consecutive monthly periods.Scenario 2You spend $50,000 on new office furniture and laptops. You expect these items to last five years and have no residual value for resale. Instead of recognizing the entire $50,000 in the first year, you should list the asset on your balance sheet and use a depreciation expense to claim $10,000 per year on your income statement. Scenario 3You spend $1000 to host a family picnic to celebrate the completion of your SaaS product. This kind gesture cannot be matched to any individual sales and can be recognized under the immediate allocation method as an expense in the period it was paid.In a related article, we offer a tutorial on managing your total expenses. Click over for some useful help.The decision to use the accrual accounting method is sometimes made for you by a tax authority. However, the added costs and complexity are more than made up for by the clarity provided on your company’s financial health today and the ability to forecast better into the future. If you are currently using the cash accounting method, consider discussing with your accountants what it would take to move to the accrual accounting method and why that might be better for you.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services.

      "Best Accounting Tools for Small Businesses.\n",
      "Very few people like bookkeeping or accounting, and even fewer can do it well. However, these are the core processes to any successful business, and a failure to keep up with bookkeeping and accounting tasks means trouble—and not just with the tax authorities.If you lose track of expenses, you’ll be overpaying on taxes, if you even stay in business long enough to reach tax season. Indeed, how can you expect to make the right strategic decisions without understanding simple things such as the cost structure of your business?Without the basic bookkeeping and accounting tasks completed, and completed well, good luck moving on to the more difficult tasks such as analyzing your unit economics or performing price analysis.That’s why you need great accounting tools when working on your business. The ideal accounting tool will take the monotony and guesswork out of bookkeeping tasks so you can move on to other more important matters. That’s why we are going to give you a list of all the best accounting tools for small businesses in this article, so you can find the selection of accounting tools that fits your needs, from basic bookkeeping to financial forecasting and more.Accounting tools and forecasting tools go hand in hand to make sure you have all the GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and SaaS-specific financial metrics at your fingertips needed to make the best strategic decisions for your business.Before we give you a list of the best accounting tools, let’s consider the main functions of accounting. Accounting is the process of recording and reporting the financial information of your company. It can help you determine simple but important information such as how much money is coming in or what your expenses are. Moreover, it can help you keep control over expenses, forecast your growth strategy, and minimize your tax burden. Here are four specific functions of accounting.Budgets are the predefined guidelines of how much your small business can spend safely over a period of time. Although budgets can be flexible and you may end up spending more or less money than allocated in your monthly or yearly budgets, having a rough idea of how much you feel comfortable spending will help prevent you from letting your expenses spiral out of control.This is a management accounting process used to determine how your small business allocates costs to specific goods or services. This includes the direct costs such as materials and labor as well as the indirect costs such as overhead.Understanding your cost allocation gives you a better idea of the marginal costs of your goods or services and therefore the price you need to charge to guarantee long-term profitability. Every period your business will need to generate financial statements. Although the drafting of these financial statements might be compelled by tax or other regulatory authorities, even if this weren’t the case, you’d want to do so because they give you a great understanding of your company.The three main financial statements are the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. These statements tell you about the assets, equity, and liabilities of your small business, the revenue, expenses, and net profit of your small business, and the net cash flow of your business, respectively.Forecasting is not always associated with accounting. It is the process of taking an inventory of your current financial situation, how it has changed over time, the prevailing market conditions, and any other relevant information and then projecting it into the future. This helps your small business plan future budgets, allocate costs, and perform every other day-to-day function in the business in a profit-maximizing way.Despite the importance of forecasting as a key accounting task, it is an often-overlooked component of accounting tools for small businesses. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Every small business is different, and the functions they need in their accounting tools are also different. When selecting which accounting tools will best meet the needs of your small business, consider the following five features.If you have no physical products, then investing in software that features inventory management tools might not bring your company much value. Conversely, if your company has employees, then your will want to make sure that you have payroll functionality. Make sure the collection of software you amass has all your needed features.If the tool is hard to use, unnecessarily complex, or requires a lot of previous bookkeeping knowledge, then, even if it has all the functionality you need, you might find you don’t use it. Especially when starting out, consider a more streamlined set of accounting tools. Furthermore, consider starting out with software that has a free trial period so you have time to learn how to use the product and whether it will bring your company value before you need to spend money.Having access to your subscription and data on the go is invaluable for the founder of a new business as you can then bring it with you while on the go. Cloud accessibility is a must have for most tech-savvy entrepreneurs. When you are just starting out, you need to work lean, especially when bootstrapping.Find the product that matches your budget. Furthermore, consider whether a subscription-based solution might be better than a larger upfront price tag. If you are bringing in revenue yourself through a subscription-based revenue model, then confidence in your improving MRR might mean paying over time is prudent. Keeping costs low when you are a new business is paramount.Most entrepreneurs aim to scale their business over time. If you also want to keep growing, then try to find accounting tools that can grow with you. The last thing you want is to have to port all of your data over to a new product every few years—if it’s even possible. That continuity of process will save you time in the long run.There is no best accounting tool—just tools that meet or don’t meet your needs. Indeed, most small businesses will find value in using multiple different tools.QuickBooks is great for your tax needs, while Gusto Payroll helps with payroll and Expensify can help track your expenses. The following is a short summary of some of the popular accounting software packages available on the market.QuickBooks Online: QuickBooks is the all-inclusive automated accounting software package for small businesses.

      "What Is an Income Statement for SaaS?.\n",
      "The income statement is one of the three main statements that show the financial health of a company (along with the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows).Check out an example income statement here:ABC CorporationIncome Statement (in thousands)Year ending 12/31/2021Revenue  Monthly Subscriptions50,000  Recognized Portion of Annual Subscriptions20,000     Less returns, discounts, and refunds12,000Net Sales Revenue58,000Costs of Goods Sold  Hosting Fees, Payment Gateway Fees, etc.5,000  Labor Costs3,000Total Costs of Goods Sold8,000Gross Profit50,000Expenses  Rent12,000  Utilities6,000  Administration Expenses10,000  Salaries10,000  Depreciation4,000  Amortization4,000   Interest on bank loan 3,000Total Expenses49,000Gains  Sale of underperforming platform10,000Losses  Disposal fee for old equipment1,000EBITDA21,000EBIT13,000Taxes Owed2,000Net Income8,000This article will break down this example income statement so you can fully understand it.The income statement has many names—profit and loss account, profit and loss statement, statement of profit and loss, statement of operations, statement of financial performance, statement of earnings, earnings statement, revenue statement, and operating statement—but we’ll stick with calling it the income statement here.The income statement lists all the revenue and expenses of the company, any other gains and losses, and then it has a tally at the bottom which shows your net profit (or loss). Similar to the statement of cash flows, which shows the way cash is flowing into and out of your company, the income statement is drafted for a period of time.Conversely, the balance sheet, which shows your assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity, is drafted for an exact moment in time.In the SaaS world, your revenue is probably recurring, regardless of the revenue model you have chosen. The biggest challenges when drafting an income statement for a subscription SaaS provider will be understanding when you can recognize your revenue and expenses according to the accrual accounting method. This means knowing when your revenue is earned and your expenses are incurred. That means you need to be tracking your MRR, ARR, LTV, churn, dunning, and more. Finding the time and skills to do this in-house is a distraction from your core mission. That’s where Baremetrics comes in. Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard. Check out what the MRR graph looks like right here:Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.The income statement is very information-dense. It shows all your revenue and expenses, which are the money you bring in and the costs of your business, respectively. It also shows other gains and losses, for example interest on an account or a settlement from a lawsuit. It also shows your profit (or loss).Depending on how detailed the income statement is, it might also include other subtotals, such as your EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).  Below we’ll list all of the information that might be found on an income statement. Depending on the complexity of your company and local regulatory requirements, the information contained and the format of the income statement can vary widely.The revenue section is the very top of the income statement. It details all the money you have made based on your core business processes. It can be separated into your different revenue streams or just listed as a single item. It might also include the negative value of returns, defects, etc., which is followed by your net revenue value.There are several different places where expenses are shown. Usually, the costs of goods sold are shown after the net revenue to calculate the gross profit, while the other expenses follow in a dedicated section. Expenses can be separated into the two types of cash expenses and non-cash expenses. They can also be separated into the two types of operating expenses and non-operating expenses.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): COGS commonly follows the revenue on the income statement so that the gross profit can be calculated and presented before other expenses are shown. This is the total cost of sales or services, also referred to as the cost incurred to manufacture goods or services. COGS only includes the direct costs of producing your service and not the indirect costs, such as overhead.Operating Expenses: These are the expenses generated by a company’s core business activities. Operating expenses include payroll, pension contributions, and sales commission.Non-Operating Expenses: The expenses that are not generated by core business activities are known as non-operating expenses. Examples of non-operating expenses include obsolete inventory charges.Non-cash expenses are a lot more complicated than cash expenses. These do not involve any cash flow and are simply a way of turning long-term tangible and intangible assets (i.e., depreciation and amortization) into expenses to improve your tax situation. This is why some companies prefer to present their EBIT and EBITDA to investors as a better presentation of their current financial health, even though they are not GAAP approved.Depreciation: Depreciation is a method for spreading the cost of a long-term tangible asset over its useful life. Depreciable assets can include buildings, equipment, office furniture, vehicles, land, and machinery.Amortization: Amortization is a system for spreading the cost of an intangible asset over the course of its useful life. Amortizable assets can include patents and trademarks, franchise agreements, proprietary processes, and the cost of issuing bonds to raise capital.Gains and losses appear similar to revenue and expenses, respectively, but they are typically one-time, rare, and unexpected events. They often represent the money gained or lost from a market pivot or operations restructuring. Gains sometimes follow revenue and losses expenses on the income statement, but they can also be incorporated into those sections or follow both revenues and expenses together at the bottom of the income statement only preceding the final tally of profit or loss. In the example income statement below, we use the last option for clarity.Don’t confuse the term loss meaning a negative net profit with losses meaning these one-time negative monetary events!Gains: Gains are the results of positive financial events not related to the company’s core activities. Gains indicate the amount of money gained by the company from one-off events. They can include the sale of an operating segment. For example, Baremetrics sold Intros for $100,000. Gains can also come from selling off old vehicles, unused lands, etc. Losses: Similarly, losses are the results of negative financial events not related to the company’s core activities. Losses indicate the amount of money the company lost from such one-off events. They can include the settlement of a lawsuit or a loss due to a stock trade.Throughout the income statement, you will find some totals. Aside from total revenue, total expenses, and net revenue, you usually find the gross profit after the revenue and COGS, the net income right at the bottom, and, depending on the level of detail, EBIT and EBITDA as well.Gross Profit: Gross profit is the net revenue minus COGS. It is sometimes turned into a percentage, which is called the gross profit marginEBIT (or Operating Earnings): This is a non-GAAP measure of a company’s financial performance. It tells you how much the company has made before subtracting interest and taxes.EBITDA: This is another non-GAAP measure of profitability. In addition to not including interest and taxes, EBITDA subtracts non-cash expenses, i.e., depreciation and amortization, as well. This can give you an idea of the true profitability of the period since depreciation and amortization are accounting expenses only.Net Income: Net profit (or loss) is the amount of money your company finally earned (or lost). It comes at the very bottom of the income statement and is net of everything including COGS, cash and non-cash expenses, interest on your loans, and taxes.Below is an example income statement. At the top, you can see the company’s name, the date, and the period. This income statement is for the creatively named “ABC Corporation” and is for the year ending 2021. You can also see that this is represented in thousands (so 50,000 actually means $50,000,000 and so on).Under the revenue section, monthly and annual subscriptions are separated. This company must feel that it is important to keep track of these separately because they have different bearings on the financial health of the business.The company has $70,000,000 in gross sales, which results in $58,000,000 in net sales after all refunds and discounts. With low COGS of $8,000,000, the company has a robust gross profit of $50,000,000.However, the bulk of its expenses are not represented by COGS, totalling an additional $49,000,000. In fact, without the one-time sale under gains, there’d be almost no profit at the end of the year.You can see that net income, EBIT, and EBITDA are all presented. Net income includes everything, while EBITDA ignores the bottom three expenses and taxes and EBIT doesn’t include the last expense and taxes.ABC CorporationIncome Statement (in thousands)Year ending 12/31/2021Revenue  Monthly Subscriptions50,000  Recognized Portion of Annual Subscriptions20,000     Less returns, discounts, and refunds12,000Net Sales Revenue58,000Costs of Goods Sold  Hosting Fees, Payment Gateway Fees, etc.5,000  Labor Costs3,000Total Costs of Goods Sold8,000Gross Profit50,000Expenses  Rent12,000  Utilities6,000  Administration Expenses10,000  Salaries10,000  Depreciation4,000  Amortization4,000   Interest on bank loan 3,000Total Expenses49,000Gains  Sale of underperforming platform10,000Losses  Disposal fee for old equipment1,000EBITDA21,000EBIT13,000Taxes Owed2,000Net Income8,000The most important differences when drafting an income statement for your SaaS enterprise come down to revenue recognition. ASC 606 has defined clearly when revenue can be recognized with specific guidelines in place for subscription revenue.

      "The Principles of SaaS Accounting.\n",
      "This article will dive into the main principles of accounting for SaaS. The Baremetrics blog has a ton of articles about accounting, so be sure to check out some of our other favorites!Here we will look at what makes accounting for SaaS different from traditional accounting, as well as:Considerations for accounting with SaaS, PaaS, and beyondBookings, billings, and revenueBalance sheetsIncome statementsCash flow statementStatement of shareholders’ equity Getting metrics for your accountingBaremetrics plays a role in your SaaS accounting by providing you the metrics you need to fill out your statement sheets. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and check it out here:When running a SaaS company, tracking revenue becomes a unique challenge. This is because customers are charged subscription fees, which can change drastically from month to month depending on the pricing model. Customers often change their service level and add or remove extra services, causing MRR for that customer to change.SaaS products need to have a strong hold on their data as their business changes rapidly month-to-month. Using specific business metrics tools for SaaS is a must when running your SaaS accounting.There are many reasons a growth-oriented SaaS company needs SaaS-specific accounting:Small changes in churn, average revenue per user, etc. can drive massive swings in cash flow.Being able to accurately project revenue into the future can help your business maintain a strong cash position so you do not need to look to outside investors.Depending on your jurisdiction and annual revenue, state and federal taxes (and sales tax too) might require you to meet certain accounting criteria.In accordance with the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), you cannot fully recognize the revenue from your contracts until the services have been delivered. With varying contract lengths, different bundle options, add-on services, etc., SaaS businesses require the ability and flexibility to recognize revenue in a manner consistent with their agreements.SaaS businesses also tend to use specific SaaS accounting software and data tools from other businesses, even other startups, which require your accountant to have specialized knowledge.Early and consistent SaaS accounting standards can keep your data clean, accurate, easily visualizable, and actionable. You don’t want to get into the habit of ad hoc accounting when your business is small only to find it is a costly and difficult mess to unravel later. It is best to stick to the SaaS accounting best practices from day one.Although we’ve talked about cash accounting before, here’s a brief summary of cash vs. accrual accounting, and why it might be better for your SaaS company to use accrual accounting as soon as you have the capacity to do so. Utilizing or providing “XaaS” business complicates your tax situation as you may be required to amortize revenue or expenses over a long period of time. For example, if a company pays you $1200 annually for your service, you may need to recognize that as 12 payments of $100 at the end of each month as the services are rendered. This is where the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting becomes visible.Cash accounting is basically what it says. You record revenue when the cash enters your account and you record expenses when the invoice is paid. This drastically simplifies your journals as you do not need to worry about accounts payable or accounts receivable. It is especially useful for small businesses and enterprises that do not require much inventory.ProsSimpleEasy to know how much cash you have one handCan be tax advantageous ConsDifficult to deal with inventoryGovernment tax authorities might not accept itCan make forecasting more difficultMight make the company appear more or less profitable on paper than in realityAccrual accounting utilizes accounts receivable and accounts payable to record revenue when they are earned and expenses when they are incurred, respectively. This can be complicated, but the reward is a clearer and more accurate view of the company’s financial health. For this reason, accrual accounting is more commonly used by large businesses and is the preferred choice by tax authorities.ProsMakes forecasting easier and more accurateGives a more accurate representation of the company’s financial healthConsComplexRequires professional bookkeeping and accounting servicesThe company might have to pay taxes on revenue earned but not yet receivedThree major considerations when working on SaaS accounting are bookings, billings, and revenue.Let’s take a look at each of them.Bookings represent your customers’ commitments to pay you money for the services you provide. This is a forward-looking metric and represents the value of the contracts you have signed with customers over a specified period.Bookings can be separated into different subcategories, including renewal bookings, upgraded bookings, new bookings, and non-recurring bookings (e.g., set up fees or training fees). Bookings that have a forward period of at least one year can be considered based on either the annual contract value of the bookings, which accounts for only the current year portion of the contract, or the total contract value of the bookings, which is calculated based on the complete duration of the contract. Billings are the money owed to you by your customers. They are invoice amounts billed to customers. They are usually recorded over a period, usually monthly or for the whole year. If your SaaS business has high bookings but lower billings, this can be a leading indicator of future cash flow problems. You can find this information easily by generating detailed statements of cash flow on a regular basis, which is discussed a bit more below. Trying to get monthly customers to be annual customers through discounts, or otherwise compelling customers to move up their payments is a good way to avoid this issue.Revenue is the income that you have earned by providing services. If you are using accrual accounting, then you can recognize your sales as the services have been rendered. If you only look at your bookings and billings when assessing performance, it can lead to inflated numbers. You don’t want to be assuming profit monthly for months on end only to find out the customer can no longer pay you for the services rendered. In fact, some companies will decrease their outstanding accounts receivable by some percentage every month they are overdue, assuming that the longer payment is put off, the less likely they will see the money land in their account.Speaking of revenue, why not check out our article on how to improve revenue growth and build your business faster.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily. Check out the revenue metrics right in your Baremetrics dashboard like this:There are four basic financial statements that every company should be producing regularly—not only because tax authorities demand it, but because they offer a clear idea of how your company is doing and where it will be going so that you can double down on what is working. These statements are the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, and statement of shareholders’ equity. The balance sheet presents the following information about your company:AssetsCash and cash equivalents (anything that can be turned to cash quickly, e.g., liquid investments)InventoryAccounts receivableLong-term assets including equipment, buildings, furniture, etc.Intangible assets (your brand value, the value of your intellectual property, etc.)LiabilitiesAccounts payableSales taxShort-term debt (e.g., credit cards)Long-term debt (bonds issued, mortgages, etc.)EquityInvested equity Retained earningsNote that, while the balance sheet shows where your company is at a given moment, the following three statements are produced for a period of time and show how the company has changed during that time.The income statement includes the following information about your company:RevenueCost of goods soldGross Profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold)Operating expensesNet profitThe statement of cash flows details the following about your company:Changes in inventoryOther working capital changes Operating incomeInvestments in equipment, property, etc.Capital added (investments) or removed from the company (realized profits, e.g., dividends)Any loans paid down or new loans taken outNet cash flow, i.e. the change in your cash positionThe statement of shareholders’ equity lists the following about your company:Each shareholder’s ownership at the beginning of the periodTheir ownership shares at the end of the periodAny changes that may have occurred in these positions during the periodThe metrics you can gain, especially when considering your billings, bookings, and revenues, from well drafted books based on SaaS accounting best practices are an essential part of success.

      "What Is a Payment Ledger?.\n",
      "A payment ledger is one of the basic tools of bookkeeping. It helps to record payments related to a specific purpose. This might be anything from a small project within a company to the full day-to-day cash activities of the entire company.A ledger allows you to record the item when it is conceived and then update it upon payment, which means you don’t forget about upcoming items or forget to follow through on the payment of previous items. Payment ledgers can be used to track the money that your company owes or the money that is owed to the company. For example, a landlord might keep a payment ledger to record when the monthly rent is paid. Conversely, the same landlord might also keep track of all their maintenance expenses on a separate payment ledger to make sure that they aren’t paying contractors late.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard.

That might sound wishy-washy, but not every payment ledger needs to show all the same information, and not every bookkeeper needs to have the same information at hand. Some people might be satisfied with the name of the company, the amount owed, and a checkbox to indicate whether the bill has been paid. Others may require all of that information, as well as an itemized list of everything included in the amount owed, the date the invoice was issued, the date the invoice was paid, the country of origin, a list of all previous transactions by the previous customer, etc. What information is included might also be dictated by the Generally Accepted Account Principles (GAAP).If you are using a payment ledger to collect $10 from everyone in the office for the annual birthday cake fund, you probably don’t need it to include much detail. Conversely, if you hope to use the customer information you gathered for high-end data analysis, then collecting more information is always better—especially when it can now be done automatically without needless customer or employee time and energy.The payment ledger can really be as simple or as detailed as you need it to be.However, let’s look at some of the main items that can be included.Client Name: This item will be on every payment ledger. Purchase Amount: This is basic information that tells you how much your client needs to pay.Payment Type: This can show you how the client paid (credit card, etc.) or which payment gateway they used (PayPal, etc.). This could be important to gather how much in fees you are spending, or whether one of your payment gateways could be dropped without hurting your overall MRR too much.Associated Transactions: You could use this to keep track of other transactions performed by the same client. This might help you calculate your expansion MRR.Order/Payment Dates: This can help you understand how long the delay is between when your service is ordered and the payment is received.Group: On Baremetrics, you can set up groups based on anything to separate your clients into useful groups for data analysis. This might be based on country of origin, the pricing tier they’ve selected, the length of their contract lifetime, the size of the company, or even more exotic differentiating attributes.Notes: Sometimes it is important to add small information about a client to their different transactions in the payment ledger. This can, for example, help jog your memory when it comes time to interact with the customer in the future. This information can be used to add a personal touch to emails.Address: The customer’s address can also be important, especially if physical deliveries are going to be made.Transaction Number: Giving each line in your payment ledger a unique number can help when tracking the transaction across variation spreadsheets, etc. If links get overwritten, sometimes a unique number is the fastest way to track down the original payment ledger entry.Status: This could indicate whether the transaction has been completed, failed, paid, refunded, etc.While watching your bank account might be enough for an individual, the small discrepancies between the shown balance and the actual available funds increases with the number of transactions being made and can land a large, complex company in trouble.For example, checks can take a week to show up on your bank statement, while credit card payments can be posted days later. With daily transactions numbering in the tens, hundreds, or even thousands, those discrepancies quickly add up.If you are using multiple payment gateways, which also post transactions with a delay and take time transferring cash to your accounts where it can be used for operating activities, this issue is further compounded.While a payment ledger doesn’t solve all the delays, it does help prevent the delays from getting you into trouble with overdraft charges, late payment fees, and all the other small costs that can really hurt a company’s profitability.The following is a simple example of a payment ledger:Payment LedgerTransaction NumberDue DateCustomer NameAmount DueNotesDate Paid123…While not particularly comprehensive, this simple payment ledger still gives you a lot of information. With a transaction number to attach this information to other sources, you can access further details elsewhere. With both a due date and a date paid, you can see whether a payment has been made and, if so, whether it was on time. You can also see the value of the transaction and which customer made the order.For a SaaS enterprise, it is unlikely that you will have a physical payment ledger, although keeping track of important information with a pen and paper can still be helpful so don’t eschew such practices entirely. For example, keeping track on a notepad of larger clients during their first few billing cycles, clients you are afraid might churn soon, or clients that have had credit card failures recently will remind you to take extra care to check on their payments when their subscription fee is due.That being said, the majority of your payment ledger activities will be digital—and probably in the cloud. Your payment gateways likely provide a lot of information about transactions—successful or otherwise. Accessing that information to arrange it in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand payment ledger can be difficult. That’s where Baremetrics comes in handy.Baremetrics can work as a payment ledger for your company. In addition to all its other amazing features, such as Baremetrics Recover to prevent failed charges or Cancellations to help you understand why customers leave so you can prevent it from happening, there is a live stream of your payments coming in.All of these different tools function together to be a payment ledger for your business. The live stream can even filter out specific transaction statuses. For example, you can see only your new customers, customers that have upgraded, refunds handed out, or failed payments.Using this information helps you make strategic decisions based on the status of the transactions.Let’s take a look at some of these features:Figure 3.1 and 3.2 shows the live stream of all the transactions occurring on your platform. On the right we can see only the failed charges filtered. This can help give you the information needed to take strategic actions based on the status of the transaction.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start using it as your comprehensive payment ledger.\n"

      "SaaS Balance Sheets – With Example.\n",
      "The balance sheet is one of the three main financial statements, along with the income statement and statement of cash flows, that show your company’s financial health. Unlike the statement of cash flows and income statement, which cover a period of time, the balance sheet is unique in showing the value of your company in a moment of time. The balance sheet includes your assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. While liabilities are the amount the company currently owes to customers, suppliers, or banks, equity is the portion of the company owned by the investors. Assets are all the things of value possessed by the company, whether financed by liabilities or equity.In the case of a SaaS business, your most valuable assets are the contracts you have with your clients and the platform they use.Speaking of your users, it is important to understand how much revenue they are generating with the best possible estimates of your MRR and ARR. It is also important to track the contracts to minimize churn and prevent dunning.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. You can use Baremetrics to pull metrics out of your business, and then input those numbers directly into your balance sheet. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.A balance sheet is usually divided into a left side and a right side. On the left side you have assets. On the right side you have liabilities and equity. The left side must equal the right side (hence the name balance). This leads to perhaps the most fundamental equation in accounting:Assets = Liabilities + Equity (ALE)or, if you don’t drink alcohol you might prefer,Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity (ALOE)Whichever abbreviation you prefer, this equation must balance. Before switching from your day-to-day bookkeeping work to the end of period financial statement drafting, you should double check that this equation balances (as well as all your journals) with a trial balance. If you do find yourself with an “imbalance sheet” (no, accountants don’t call it that, but they might chuckle if you do), some of the main culprits are the following:While the prototypical balance sheet, as mentioned above, is split into a left side and a right side, the reality is that a random landscape page in a company’s prospectus is not visually appealing. For this reason, often the left side is placed above the right side so that, from top to bottom, the balance sheet lists the assets, then liabilities, and finally equity. This makes it look more similar to the other financial documents and therefore easier to read, even if you need to keep “ALE” in your mind to see the balancing. As with all other financial statements, there are many nested categories on the balance sheet. Within assets there are current and fixed assets. Similarly, there are current and long-term liabilities. There are also different types of equity, even if they amount to “what the owners own”. Let’s take a closer look at the items on the balance sheet. Some of these items have far bigger meanings in SaaS than elsewhere, while others will hardly appear at all.Current assets include basically everything that is currently cash or will be turned into cash within a year.Cash and Cash Equivalents: The first part is pretty straightforward. Cash can be anything from notes in your petty cash to the balance of your checking account. Cash equivalents are those items that can be turned into cash immediately, such as marketable securities (bonds and stocks).Accounts Receivable: This is one of two items that only appear on the balance sheet under the accrual accounting system and not the cash accounting system. Accounts receivable includes the revenue that your company has recognized but not yet collected. As you receive payments for the services you’ve already provided, this account will decrease while your cash account will increase.Inventory: Inventory includes all supplies on hand to produce products for sale as well as the products ready to be sold. Many SaaS businesses have zero inventory. Fixed assets include all the assets that will not be turned into cash within a year. These are typically items that are used to operate your business over the long term. While SaaS businesses that are trying to bootstrap their way to profitability may not typically have many tangible fixed assets, they certainly will have intangible assets. In fact, for a SaaS business, intangible assets are probably the most valuable assets.Plant, Property, and Equipment (PP&E): PP&E is a catch-all term for the company’s tangible fixed assets. The line item is noted net of accumulated depreciation. Some companies will separate PP&E into its various components, such as buildings, land, and equipment.Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are marketable things of value that cannot be touched. They can include patents, technology, licenses, contracts, and brands. Current liabilities are the debts you owe that must be paid within the next year. For a SaaS business, the deferred revenue category is particularly important. Accounts Payable: Along with accounts receivable, accounts payable are only used in the accrual accounting system. These are expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid for, such as the utility bill sitting on your desk or invoiced services that you do not need to pay immediately.Current Debt/Notes Payable: These are the debts you need to pay completely within a year.Current Portion of Long-Term Debt: Some companies separate out the part of long-term debt that needs to be paid within the following year. For example, your mortgage might be 25 years long, but the current portion includes all the payments you’ll make over the next year.Deferred Revenue: Counterintuitively, if you have collected money for services that have not yet been rendered, this is a liability because you owe the client for those services.Long-term liabilities are pretty self-explanatory. These are debts that you do not need to pay off within the next year. For example, if you have sought outside investment into your business, instead of selling a stake in your company, you may have sold bonds.Bonds Payable: This account includes the amortized amount of bonds the company has issued.Long-Term Debt:  This is any other debt that you owe and will not be paid off within the next year. Mortgages are a common form of long-term debt.This is everything owned by the investors. This includes the initial investments by the founders, additional investments by venture capitalists, and any retained earnings the company has managed to generate.Capital: This is everything put into the company by the founders as well as any venture capitalists.Retained Earnings: This is the profit that the company has not paid out as dividends.Treasury Stock: Instead of retaining earnings as cash in the company, it might decide to buy treasury stocks to bolster its share price.The balance sheet is important because it can give you specific information about the company’s financial health. For example, by comparing the equity and liabilities, you can see if the company is over-leveraged, that is the debts are dangerously high.It can also give you a view of the efficiency of the company by showing you how much retained earnings have been generated relative to the amount of assets. Perhaps most important of all, it can give you an understanding of the liquidity of the company. By calculating the quick ratio,  you can see immediately whether the company is moving towards a cash crunch. In addition, if the accounts receivable, and especially the written off amount as bad debts, are getting out of hand, then you know the company is unable to collect what it is owed from customers.For this last point, there is no need to calculate these metrics alone. Baremetrics can monitor your SaaS quick ratio for you. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.While the look and feel of a balance sheet doesn’t change much in the SaaS paradigm, the specifics do. As mentioned above, you are likely to see some items balloon in value, especially accounts receivable, deferred revenue, and intangible assets. Conversely, you are likely to have far less in the way of property or equipment, especially if you are outsourcing any server needs.You’ll also need to monitor this information differently. A really high deferred revenue isn’t a problem so long as you are confident in your ability to render those services when due. Similarly, large accounts receivable values are fine so long as you aren’t eventually writing off a large portion as uncollectible. Baremetrics can help you keep your accounts receivable in check with its dunning tools.Let’s look at the example balance sheet below. At the top, we can see that the balance sheet was made on December 31st, 2021 for ABC Corporation. We can also see that it is reported in thousands (so the 5,000 in cash and equivalents is actually $5,000,000). The company has $6,300,000 in current liabilities which is higher than the $6,000,000 in current assets, but, since most of those liabilities are in the form of deferred revenue, the quick ratio isn’t too concerning. The intangibles have a very high value, which might indicate a lot of value or that the company is representing itself as more valuable than it is in reality. It is hard to say, but, with retained earnings of $4,500,000, it might be true, especially if it only took a year or two to reach so much added equity.ABC CorporationBalance Sheet for 12/31/2021 (in thousands)ASSETSLIABILITIES AND EQUITYCurrent AssetsLiabilitiesCash and equivalents5,000Accounts receivable1,000Current liabilitiesAccounts payable300Total current assets6,000Deferred revenue6,000Fixed assetsTotal current liabilities6,300Equipment100Intangibles30,000Long-term Debt10,000Total fixed assets30,100Total liabilities16,600EquityShareholders’ capital15,000Retained earnings4,500Total equity19,500Total assets36,100Total liabilities and equity36,100Baremetrics can help you draft your balance sheet by tracking the value of your contracts.

      "Examples of Assets in SaaS.\n",
      "In general terms, assets are anything of value owned by someone or something. Assets can be anything from a building to a copyright. They are items that can be converted into cash, and assets can be owned by an individual, company, or government. In this article, we discuss assets, give you lists (really long lists) of examples of assets, and give some tips on how to get the most out of your assets. We also show you what assets you are specifically likely to see while running your SaaS company.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior onto a crystal-clear dashboard.With Baremetrics, you can get the most out of your assets by putting them to productive work generating more revenue.  Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Assets have three main properties:Assets make up the left side of the balance sheet, which is one of the three main operating financial statements (along with the income statement and the statement of cash flows). They are all the items owned by a company. Assets can be purchased using owner’s equity or liabilities. While a liability is everything the company owes (including, strangely, your deferred revenue), assets are all the items a company owns.Assets can be classified in many different ways. Here are some of the ways that they can be classified:There are many ways to separate assets into different types. Let’s look at some of the ways we can differentiate assets into different classes. First, assets can be tangible (things you can touch) or intangible (things you cannot touch). Let’s look at some examples of assets in these classes.Tangible assets are any assets that you can touch. They are physical goods.Examples of assets classified as tangible include the following: buildings, cash on deposit, cash on hand, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, corporate stock, debentures held, equipment, federal agency securities, federal treasury notes, guaranteed investment accounts, inventory, land, loans to members of insurance trusts, loans receivables, marketable securities, money market funds, mortgages (receivable) held directly, mutual funds, notes receivables, repurchase agreements, “restricted” cash and investments, savings accounts, state and local government securities, time deposits, and warrants (to purchase securities).Depending on the stage of your SaaS enterprise, you are likely to encounter buildings, cash and cash equivalents, and equipment as tangible assets. However, for most SaaS companies, especially young ones, your most valuable assets are likely to be intangible. Intangible assets are non-physical, meaning they cannot be touched. Their value is attributable to the advantage they represent to a business or organization. Examples of assets classified as intangible include the following: accounts receivable, blueprints, bonds, brand names, brand recognition, broadcast licenses, buy–sell agreements, chemical formulas, computer programs, contracts, cooperative agreements, copyrights, customer relationships, databases, designs and drawings, distribution rights, development rights, distribution networks, domain names, FCC licenses, film libraries, franchise agreements, goodwill, historical documents, joint ventures, laboratory notebooks, landing rights, licenses, loan portfolios, location value, management contracts, manual databases, manuscripts, medical charts and records, methodologies, mineral rights, musical compositions, natural resources, patents, permits, procedural manuals, product designs, property use rights, proprietary technology, royalty agreements, schematics and diagrams, securities portfolios, security interests, shareholder agreements, solicitation rights, supplier contracts, technology sharing agreements, title plants, trademarks, trade secrets, trained and assembled workforce, training manuals, and use rights for air/water/land. As a SaaS enterprise, you are likely to possess at some point intangible assets such as accounts receivable, brand names, brand recognition, computer programs, copyrights, customer relationships, databases, designs and drawings, domain names, goodwill, joint ventures, management contracts, product designs, proprietary technology, trademarks, trained and assembled workforce, and training manuals. Indeed, especially if you rent your premises or have taken the pandemic cue to go permanently work from home, it is likely that most of your assets are the platform you’ve built and the contracts you’ve accumulated.This is why Baremetrics is so important. It monitors how effectively you are using your resources by measuring your MRR, LTV, and more. It also helps you manage those valuable contracts by preventing involuntary churn. Sign up for a Free Baremetrics Trial to start tracking your business in real-time.While most assets appear on your balance sheet, not all of them are permitted by the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This is usually because they are internally generated and their value on the open market is nil, if they are transferable at all.Examples of assets that are not recognized include the following: internal quality control processes, internal research and development processes, staff training investments, and the value of a brand image.Assets can also be separated into personal assets and business assets. Let’s look at some examples of assets in these categories.Of course, individuals or households can also own assets, and they include the following: cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, physical cash, treasury bills, property, land, buildings, collectibles, furniture, jewelry, vehicles, annuities, bonds, the cash value of life insurance policies, mutual funds, pensions, retirement plans, and stocks.Indeed, as the founder of your SaaS enterprise, your stake in the company (i.e., your equity) is also a personal asset. We do not need to repeat those massive lists above (Though we have some more information for you below), but the assets of your business can be intangible or tangible, recognized or not recognized, and current or fixed. Current assets are cash and anything that can be turned to cash quickly, while fixed assets are the things that stick around for a longer time and help generate revenue long into the future.Current assets are assets that can be converted into cash within a year, and they usually are converted into cash within one fiscal year. They are used to manage the day-to-day operations of your company.Examples of current assets can be placed into the following categories:Fixed assets are held by the company for a longer period and are usually difficult to sell in a timely manner. They are sometimes grouped together on the balance sheet under the section “property, plant, and equipment”.Examples of fixed assets include the following: vehicles (such as company trucks), office furniture, machinery, buildings, and land.Another major difference with fixed assets is that you can often use depreciation to slowly recognize fixed assets as expenses. We discuss this further when considering the income statement.Assets are everything your company possesses, even if you don’t own it. That is, assets can be purchased with equity or liabilities. A simple personal example would be your house. Your house is your asset whether you have a mortgage or not. If you have a mortgage, the part you own is your equity while the mortgage amount is a liability. Whatever share you own, the asset is in your possession.Recurring revenue is a stream of revenue and not an asset as recognized by GAAP. However, the “gap” between GAAP and the boots-on-the-ground reality of the SaaS world means that you likely track your MRR and ARR as closely as traditional companies track their contract assets, and certainly your customer relationships and their contracts are intangible assets.Cash is the simplest asset. It is the most current, most tangible asset available, and it deserves your attention. Cash problems can often precede other financial issues, and in the SaaS world they are often caused by credit card failures.As easy as it is to write up a company’s MRR or ARR once the variables are extracted, the numbers are messier before they get to that point. Your SaaS company likely uses payment processing software, and the data required to compute all required MRR values can be all over the place. Baremetrics can help with this by computing your MRR, ARR, and many other metrics automatically.Baremetrics can help you keep track of your most valued assets—your customers and their contracts. The crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your expenses, profit, and forecasted cash flow for specific timeframes.Baremetrics’ dunning tools can even help keep the cash flowing into your company by monitoring dunning.Sign up for a Free Baremetrics Trial to start tracking your assets in real-time.\n"

      "What Is Price Leadership?.\n",
      "When one company, or a group of companies, has a large enough market share in an industry, it may be able to push the price away from the equilibrium. This is called price leadership. This mainly occurs in industries with strong barriers to entry, for example the need for a large amount of capital to compete, where advanced technologies are required, or the government elects to only allow certain companies to control the market. While in some cases the barriers to entry make it impossible for other companies to enter the market at all, in most cases, it means that smaller firms must accept the prices the price leader has chosen.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, dunning, total customers, and more. If you’re interested in whether or not your company has the right pricing, or could leverage into price leadership, try out Baremetrics.The Baremetrics dashboard provides all the information you need to understand your company’s revenue and expenses. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial to start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.There are three main models of price leadership:Barometric: In weather, barometric pressure, or the local pressure exerted by the atmosphere, is used for weather forecasting. Similarly, some companies are particularly skillful at understanding the current mood of the market and making subtle price changes to stay in a lead position. Since barometric price leadership relies on a company’s ability to better forecast the market, it is a particularly unstable form of price leadership. Since a barometric price leader cannot force its competition to change prices, this price leadership position only lasts until a mistake is made. Regardless, adept companies can use some proven tactics to raise their prices without upsetting its customers.Collusive: This form of price leadership generally occurs in industries that have very high barriers to entry. In this case, a few very large companies, with known and similar cost structures and selling perfectly substitutable goods, collude to set a price point higher than would ordinarily occur naturally. In some places, this is illegal. The most famous example is OPEC, which sets the supply of oil to manipulate the price—driving it up or down depending on economic conditions.Dominant: This model occurs whenever there is one massive, marketing-controlling company in the same market as many smaller companies. In this case, the large player dominates the market and can set the prices, while all smaller companies are forced to follow the dominant player’s pricing model. Similar to collusion, a dominant company could find itself in legal jeopardy if it uses its powers to set predatory prices in hopes of bankrupting competitors and enacting a full monopoly.Regardless of the SaaS pricing template you choose, understanding what your prospective clients are willing to pay is important. When trying to figure out your market, consider all the different SaaS pricing models. If it makes sense, try to segment your customers with a tiered pricing model.Baremetrics can help you understand the data coming from price experiments, reduce your churn, and stay on top of your revenue growth so that you can find your way to being the price leader. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.To gain a price leader position, your company needs to have some specific advantage over the rest of the market. The following are only a few of the ways you can gain price leadership.By understanding your customer and knowing what you do best, you can match your strengths to their desires and earn more money by charging higher prices.While being a price leader has many advantages to the firm, simply working towards such a goal is also advantageous. Sometimes a small pricing change can have an outsized effect on your revenue.Instead of focusing solely on being the price leader in your sector, see if there is a specific niche you can carve out and then defend. By understanding your clients’ needs, you might be able to charge more by focusing your development time building the functionality they need.Whatever clients are willing to pay, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data. When you have many clients, some are subscribed on an annual basis while others monthly, with multiple tiers and various add-ons, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), and so much more.Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Baremetrics can monitor all the data you need to see if you have optimized your pricing model to maximize your revenue stream.

      "What is equity in accounting?.\n",
      "If you’ve ever owned stakes in a company, then you may already know what is meant by equity. However, equity accounting is not just about the shares owned by founders, investors, and shareholders. The concept of equity can be applied in a couple of different ways.For today’s discussion, however, we will focus on the concept of equity that is linked with company ownership. We will dive into the major considerations when handling equity in your accounting.If you want to see your business metrics on an easy-to-use dashboard, sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and get started.If your books are in order, your balance sheet should delineate your assets and liabilities. A company’s total equity can be measured either as the company’s book value or the company’s market value. A company’s book value is the difference between the total assets and total liabilities. The book value may be regarded as an owner’s equity but only when the company is owned as sole proprietorships or partnerships. The market value is the price a company would get if it were sold. For publicly listed companies, the market value is easily understood as the total number of shares multiplied by the share price. For non-traded companies, it’s unclear what the market value of a company will be until it’s sold, especially in SaaS. The final market value at the time of selling will be determined by negotiation and auction-style principles. Positive equity refers to the financial situation where your business’s value is worth more than what it owes. It is the best situation to be in because it means that assets are more significant than liabilities. As you may have guessed, the reverse is the case for negative equity.Whether your business has negative or positive equity is an essential factor to watch out for in your company’s accounting. Overall, knowing the book value of your equity can point out a company’s financial health regarding assets and liabilities, regardless of whether the company is privately owned or publicly traded.The following two sections describe the market value and book values of equity in greater detail.The market value of equity, also known as market capitalization for publicly traded companies, is the total dollar value of a company’s equity according to the market. The market value of equity is a measure that investors can use to understand a company’s size. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of shares owned. You can think of the market value of equity as how much investors think a company is worth today. The market value of equity changes throughout the trading day based on investor sentiments. The market value of equity for private companies is more challenging to calculate than public companies. Private companies do not make their financials available as public companies do. Valuing a private company is often achieved by using a comparable company analysis (CCA) approach. According to this approach, to value an equity stake in a private company, an interested person looks for a similar, but publicly-traded company to compare specific financial growth metrics. When a company purchases a stake in another company, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that the investor use specific methods to account for its investment. The equity accounting method or the cost accounting method is usually employed. The cost accounting method is used when the investor’s ownership stake in the investee is not substantial, usually less than a 20% stake. As such, the investor does not assert any influence or control over the investee. In utilizing the cost method, the stock purchased is recorded on a balance sheet as a non-current asset at the historical purchase price. The record isn’t changed unless the shares are sold, or additional shares purchased. For instance, if a company, XYZ, buys a 15% stake in another company for $2 million, that’s precisely how these purchased shares will be valued on XYZ’s balance sheet, irrespective of the current share price. If a dividend of $15,000 is paid to XYZ at the end of a quarter, they’ll add this money to their company’s income. Equity accounting methodology is used when the investor’s ownership stake in the investee is substantial, typically a minimum of 20 to 25 percent. The investor will exercise a high degree of influence over the investee’s business strategy and operating decisions with equity accounting.Similar to the cost method, equity accounting records the investment as a cost. The investment is subsequently adjusted to account for the investor’s share of the company’s profit and loss. For instance, a company, ABC, acquires a 45% stake in another company, DEF, for $25 million. This $25 million investment in DEF earns ABC a seat on the board of directors. If, at the end of an accounting period, the DEF records $6 million income, ABC would get 45% of that income amount. This income would be accounted for as income.The standard definition of equity is the compensation that represents ownership. Simply put, equity in SaaS is the value of owning a SaaS company. This value is sometimes expressed as shares or sometimes expressed as just ownership. Equity is commonly split among investors, founders, and sometimes the employees. The multiple stakeholders in a business split equity to ensure that some form of insurance is available if an unfortunate event should occur in the company. This insurance arrangement is especially common in startups. In SaaS, equity is the same as with traditional companies, but many people get into difficult situations when splitting the equity amongst coworkers. Consider the following when splitting up the equity of your startup:The meaning you derive from considering these points should help you develop a framework for fairness in splitting the equity. Other factors that would lend to clarity include:Ultimately, strive for fairness during the split so that all professional relationships are maintained, and teammates have enough incentive to continue bringing their best to the company. Earlier, we pointed out more forms of equity beyond the first two types listed in this article. Equity as a concept goes beyond evaluating how much money a company is worth. Think of equity as ownership in any asset after removing all the debt associated with the asset.If you think of it this way, different variations of equity exist, such as: In determining the equity of some companies, especially big companies, the assets being evaluated may go beyond tangible assets, infrastructure, and machinery. The company’s reputation and brand identity are considered a form of equity in itself. Take the Coca-Cola and Microsoft brands as an example. Throughout the growth phases of these large companies, their marketing and product or service delivery have gathered a considerable fan base, which gives the brand name some intrinsic value. This is called brand equity, and this is the value of a brand relative to a generic alternative. Brands like Coca-Cola and Microsoft make up a significant part of their parent companies’ market value. Brand equity doesn’t refer to an actual monetary value, but it does contribute to the overall value of the company.Equity in a property simply represents the value contained in the ownership of the property. A property owner can measure this by subtracting the mortgage debt owed from how much of the property they own outright. Property equity comes from the payment made against a mortgage, including an increase in the property value. Property equity is often used as proof of net worth, and property owners can use that equity to get a loan. For instance, suppose Company N owns an office with a mortgage on it. The office has a current market value of $175,000, and the mortgage owed totals $100,000. Company N has $75,000 worth of equity.Equity can be described in terms like net asset value, book value, and shareholder’s equity. The meaning of a specific reference to the term equity would depend on the context. Still, equity (whether in book values or brand values) generally refers to the value retained in investments after all liabilities associated with the investment have been paid off.Baremetrics gives you information about your company’s book values by monitoring metrics such as MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of active customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.\n"

      "Revenue vs. Profit.\n",
      "When discussing the financial metrics for a SaaS company, revenue vs. profit is among the most common comparisons encountered. This is because these two terms are essential determinants of a company’s financial position.When a SaaS product or service has been developed, tracking the ROI (return on investment) involves always keeping revenue vs. profit at the top of mind. However, these two financial terms are sometimes misrepresented in the books.It’s important to keep these two metrics separate. If you are looking for an easy way to keep track of revenue vs. profit, start tracking your subscription data with Baremetrics.Revenue is the total income brought into your SaaS company from your core business activities. It is often synonymous with a simpler term that you are already familiar with: sales.Revenue is measured over a certain period (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). When calculating your company’s revenue, no deductions are made. All monies, no matter how little, add up to yield the company’s total revenue. Net revenue, however, does deduct the returns, discounts, and refunds made.You can monitor your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) when you sign up for Baremetrics. Get on the Baremetrics platform to get better measurements of your revenue!Understanding your revenue alone may be insufficient to give you a holistic view of your company’s financial health. The reason is simple: revenue does not represent your company’s “true” return on investment.Here, profit can give you more information. Profit is the amount that remains after operating costs and variable costs have been deducted from the total revenue. Profit shows you the money on your income statement that belongs to your company after all expenses have been deducted from your revenue. It can then be added to the owner’s equity on the balance sheet under the title “retained earnings”.When someone purchases your SaaS subscription, that sale must be filtered before you can get a profit value. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses take a chunk out of the total sales amount. After these costs are deducted, the remaining amount is your company’s profit or net profit.Profit, as with revenue, is calculated for a specific period (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, or annually). A SaaS company can count on several ways to grow its sales. Revenue for a SaaS business may be challenging to track due to the different channels (e.g., different subscription packages, upgrades, or add-on) from which SaaS products and services make sales.Baremetrics helps you keep track of the different kinds of revenue that your company may acquire.Calculating revenue from disparate sources is why SaaS financial accounting is so different from the financials in traditional industries. However, revenue can be easily tracked and visualized when you have Baremetrics integrated with your system.There are clear reasons you need to understand your company’s revenue over specified periods:Later in this article, you will find discussions on revenue vs. profit as well as revenue vs. other financial metrics relationships. Together, these financial metrics boost your knowledge of your company’s financial health. The profit margin is the percentage of profit made by a company from its sales. It’s a financial metric used to assess a business’s ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue. If a business reports that its profit margin during the first quarter of the year was 40%, it means that the business had a net income of $0.4 for every dollar of sales created.There are four different types of margins. These margins are used to measure a company’s profitability at different cost levels. They include: The profit margin is among many other profitability ratios that present an excellent way to evaluate a SaaS company’s profit-generating ability. The profit margin also makes it possible to compare your profitability to your competitors relative to an industry benchmark. A company with a higher profit margin relative to its competitor or relative to a previous period shows a clear indicator of a healthy business.Suppose you wish to compare your SaaS profitability ratios such as profit margin with other companies in your industry.Baremetrics offers SaaS financial benchmarks that will show you, at a glance, what’s standard in your industry.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now. Simply put, revenue is total sales, and the costs are the expenses involved in creating those products and services for sales. Revenue and expenses are represented on an income statement for every product or service a business sells. The general goal of a company is to reduce costs while increasing sales so that the profit margin continues to increase.An important dynamic to note for revenue vs. profit is that a company can have revenue without making a profit. When a business collects payments for goods or services rendered to customers, it’s easy to think that business is also making profit. However, revenue values alone aren’t a true mark of profitability because, if the expenses of a business exceed its revenue, the company will make a loss rather than a profit.A company may have significant revenue but enjoy minimal profits from its sales. It often happens because the company’s expenses are so high that it is difficult to earn profit. An increase in business costs could dwindle profits if the business is not bringing in enough revenue. Business costs include direct costs such as wages and materials, indirect costs, and operating costs such as overhead. A business’s profit margin can be improved by carefully finding new ways to manage costs.An aspect of strategic management is resource management. Your SaaS company can choose dunning management solutions such as Baremetrics Recover as their resource management tool for failed credit card payments.However, resource management should never be at the expense of the quality of goods or services delivered. A continued increase in the cost of business would eventually lead to losses even if revenue increases.When the cost of business is reduced, but the revenue remains constant, the profits should increase. However, if cost reduction means lowering the quality of the company’s goods or services, the company might also need to reduce their price to maintain the same level of sales.Any reduction of quality (as a result of reducing the cost of business) will likely eventually lead to a gradual loss of market share. Market share is lost because it is usually challenging to maintain revenue when the quality of service is reduced. Companies that reduce cost without affecting quality and sales price can find a clear path to higher profitability.Sometimes, a business may meet misfortunes, for instance, a lawsuit that affects the business so much that it takes a huge loss. A situation such as this is usually called an extraordinary item in accounting because it’s not expected to occur again. If a company suffers a one-time loss, profits will suffer. Still, a focus on revenue can help the company return its fortunes quickly enough to show stakeholders that it is determined to get back to profitability.The goal of any business is to maximize profit by reducing costs and/or increasing revenue. A company’s effectiveness at achieving that goal depends on the relationship between its total revenue and total costs. While every business will strive to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve profit margins, it’s crucial to always keep an eye on industry benchmarks with in-depth cohort comparisons.The Baremetrics Benchmarks feature provides your company with the vital signs it needs to grow and succeed.

      "Matching and Revenue Recognition Principles.\n",
      "While companies are a bit more free to perform bookkeeping according to their own needs, accounting is a very organized and rigid discipline. While that can make it daunting at first—with so many rules and regulations to follow—as you become familiar with them, it takes all the guesswork out of the process. We are going to look at two of those principles here: the matching concept and the revenue recognition concept.Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26+ metrics about your business including: MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, so information about your customers is automatically shown on the Baremetrics dashboards. You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.The matching principle and the revenue recognition principle are the two main guiding theories underlying accrual accounting. They are defined in U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and should be used by any entity following the accrual accounting system. Matching concept: This principle stipulates that accountants should record all revenue and expenses in the same reporting period. This means that expenses should be matched to the revenue they generate and therefore be shifted into the period in which the revenue was earned instead of being recorded in the period they were paid for.Revenue recognition concept: This principle refers to the period and manner in which a company realizes its income. A company should recognize revenue in the period in which it was earned, and not necessarily when the cash was received. For a subscription SaaS provider, this can mean breaking up the money received from an annual subscription into the monthly periods as the services are provided. This provides auditors with a so-called apples-to-apples comparison of a company’s financial picture that is more transparent across industries. In the accrual accounting method, revenue is accounted for when it is earned. This usually will happen before money changes hands, for example when a service is delivered to a customer with the reasonable expectation that money will be paid in the future. Expenses are similarly recognized when they are incurred. This is done by following the matching principle. Accrual accounting entries require the use of accounts payable and accounts receivable journals, as well as a few others for deferred revenue and expenses, depreciation, etc. In the cash accounting method, revenues and expenses are recognized when cash is transferred. This is the system used by individuals when budgeting household expenses and by some small businesses. The matching concept or revenue recognition concept is not used in the cash accounting method.According to many tax authorities, SaaS companies must use the accrual accounting system, which stipulates that you record revenue when it is earned, i.e., the revenue recognition principle. In the case of a subscription revenue stream, this means when you have fulfilled your part of the service agreement.Consider the following two subscription revenue examples to make this point clear. 1. Your company offers a discount to clients that pay their bill annually instead of monthly. You have 10 clients that take advantage of the discount. These invoices total $90,000. Since you must provide services to these clients for an entire year and your income statements are drafted monthly, U.S. GAAP standards stipulate that you should move $7500 at the end of each period into your revenue account and keep the remaining unearned subscription revenue in a deferred revenue account as you have not yet earned the money.2. Your company bills clients at the end of the month for the services you’ve provided during the month. Most of your clients pay within the allowed time period, but some—due to issues with the payment system, a forgetful manager, the invoice hitting the spam folder, etc.—do not pay on time. In this case, even though you are earning $7500 at the end of each month, you may not be receiving all of it until some days, weeks, or months later—or, unfortunately, sometimes not at all. In this case, you still recognize the revenue of $7500 each month using an accounts receivable journal entry and then later move the revenue to your cash account when you receive the payments.In the first case, you have more cash on hand than your company has actually earned. In the second case, you have less cash on hand than you have earned, and you might not even receive all the money you have earned. The same is true for expenses: they must be recognized when they are incurred regardless of when the invoice is paid. This is done by matching the expenses to the revenue they generate where possible. When this is not easily possible, then either the systematic and rational allocation method or the immediate allocation method can be used. The systematic and rational allocation method allocates expenses over the useful life of the product, while the immediate allocation method recognizes the entire expense when purchased. Let’s consider a few examples for when expenses should be recognized. 1. You decide to advertise your new SaaS product on Twitter. You set a budget of $12,000 to hit your targeted market over a four-month period and pay the invoice. Since you draft monthly income statements, you divide the $12,000 into four monthly expenses of $3000 and recognize them over the four consecutive monthly periods.2. You spend $25,000 on new office furniture. It is expected that these items will last five years and have no residual value for resale. Instead of recognizing the entire $25,000 in the first year, you should list the assets on your balance sheet and use a depreciation expense to claim $5000 per year on your income statement. 3. You spend $2500 to host a party to launch your new SaaS product. Since this party cannot be matched to any individual sale, it can be recognized under the immediate allocation method as an expense in the period it was paid.The matching concept and revenue recognition concept affect the various financial statements in different ways. Let’s look at how these two principles affect the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement with a simple exercise.Consider the following set of information. You purchase inventory in Year 1 with cash. The inventory is then sold on credit in Year 2. The customer then pays the amount owing in Year 3.The purchased inventory affects the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). The sale of the inventory to the customer affects the revenue. Even though the customer doesn’t pay until Year 3, the sale was made in Year 2, so we should record the revenue earned in Year 2 according to the revenue recognition principle. Then, according to the matching principle, since the inventory purchase should be matched to its sale, even though we paid cash in Year 1, it should also be recognized under COGS in Year 2.Inventory is considered an asset, so it shows on the balance sheet. Similarly, cash is also an asset and shows on the balance sheet. In Year 1, the balance sheet will show an increased value in inventory and a decreased value in cash (which is sometimes called “cash and cash equivalents”). Then, in Year 2, the inventory will show a decrease while the accounts receivable shows an increase from the sale. Finally, in Year 3, when the customer settles their bill, accounts receivable will show a decrease, while cash will see an increase.The inventory was purchased using cash in Year 1. This is shown as a negative cash flow, i.e., a decrease in the cash account. In Year 2, the inventory was sold on credit, which doesn’t change the cash flow. Finally, in Year 3, when the customer pays for their purchase, it is recorded as a positive cash flow. There are two key takeaways from this simple example. First, the two transactions occurred over three years in reality, but both are used in the same middle year for the income statement (and therefore taxes). This can be problematic without proper planning, since you would be out cash in Year 1 to the supplier of your inventory and out the taxes owing in Year 2 for the revenue, but you won’t receive any cash until Year 3 when your customer settles their bill. Second, since large and complex businesses recognize revenue and match expenses independently of cash flow, keeping track of the cash position of the company is more difficult than it would be otherwise. Producing high-quality cash flow statements, monitoring customers closely to make sure they pay as soon as possible, and tracking any and all metrics of your company are immensely important tasks to prevent a cash crunch.This is a lot to take in at once, but with practice you’ll be able to quickly deduce when and where your revenue and expenses need to be reported. Good financial statements are the heart of any business, and keeping them in order is a surefire way to keep tax authorities happy. Having a system that can automatically segment your customers and report your revenue over specified periods makes these concepts a breeze to follow. That’s where Baremetrics comes in.Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and visualize the information about your customers and their behavior on a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Just a few of the metrics Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, and Quick Ratio.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.\n"

      "The Perfect SaaS Landing page.\n",
      "First impressions matter.This concept applies to businesses every bit as much as it does to people.So what’s the first thing a prospect sees in relation to your business?In most cases, it’s the landing page.Once a prospect has landed there, you only have a few moments to convince them that your service is right for them.That does not mean flooding your audience with information about the product. In fact, the fewer words and images it takes to convey the essence of what you’re offering, the better.In order to maximise sales, your landing page must provide key pieces of information quickly and effectively. Are you looking for financial insights into your SaaS business? Baremetrics offers over 26 different metrics to track insights. Sign up today for a  free trial.What should be on the main landing page?Information on the perfect SaaS landing page breaks down into 5 core areas:Explain the outcome of using your productShow its best features in actionWhat problems does this service fix?How do I use it?Overcome the prospect’s resistance to convert over from their current solution provider/Convince the prospect of why they need this service in the first placeHow is it better than my current solution?Is it worth the hassle of switching over?How will this tool make my life easier?Detail the ways in which your product is the best tool on the marketWhy should I choose your service specifically?Address potential resistance points and concernsWhat problems could I encounter by switching over to this service?How difficult is the set up?What happens if I change my mind?Are there any leaving penalties or hidden fees?Is this tool cross-compatible with other services I’m using?Set up pricing under the ‘save money’ principle: demonstrate that your tool saves a prospect more money than it costs themIs this service worth the fee?Each section above addresses two different perspectives: the SaaS business vs the prospects.It’s important to represent both perspectives on your landing page.Founders usually talk about their product based on what they themselves find important and interesting.This perspective is invaluable because it gives the product life, shows the values represented by the company, and focuses on what makes the business unique. The founder’s voice gives that service time to shine.This narrative, however, often fails to address any concerns a prospect may have.This happens for various reasons. The founder isn’t in the same position of having to convert over from another service, needing to train team members in new software, or consider cross-compatibility with other tools. For that reason, they might not pre-empt certain types of problems, or could consider certain details too obvious to mention. Founders also tend to have a much more detail-oriented view having spent however long developing a tool, and focus on different aspects of the product that overall are less important to the prospect.For that reason, it’s critical for a successful SaaS landing page to understand a prospect’s perspective, in order to head off any burning questions they may have.Ambiguity is one of the key reasons for losing a sale: in the age of impatience, presenting well-structured information with absolute clarity is essential. If a common question can’t be answered without clicking away to another page, you will be losing a proportion of potential sales.Are there cases in which information should be spread over multiple pages?Yes. Some types of information call for additional pages.Examples of where this is most effective include sections such as ‘meet the team’, ‘our mission’, ‘detailed FAQ’, ‘feature updates’ and so forth.As a rule of thumb, if it doesn’t qualify as a ‘central concern to the prospect’, take it off the landing page and give it its own space. Not sure what questions a prospect might have?Surveys and phone calls to customers are a great way to find out what matters to them.You can also have yourself and your team participate in product questionnaires:Next time you’re looking to buy something that requires some research, whether it’s a service or physical item, write down your own questions while browsing the product description, reviews, and competition.As a next step, put yourself in the shoes of a consumer when you browse your own SaaS landing page in reference to the questions you noted down.Is all the necessary information present?How far do you need to browse to answer each question?Are the answers clear and unambiguous?Is there a better format in which to present this information?Information can be presented in a multitude of ways.Consider different formats, and their respective strengths (i.e., what type of information about your product they’re best suited to communicate):It’s best to create a balance between text and other formats in order to avoid information overload and create a dynamic, memorable page.Be mindful as well of how to use static vs moving graphics.Any key information must be static. Having make-or-break decision factors such as pricing or core features move around on screen is nothing short of a design sin, and will put off prospects sufficiently to go elsewhere.When used correctly, moving graphics can, however, be a powerful way to convey a message. Information that is of less direct consequence, and suggests that ‘there’s plenty more like this’ can benefit from moving graphics, as long as it doesn’t distract from the central details.A stream of positive testimonials wiping left off screen, or a looped video of browsing through a service dashboard are prime examples of information that works well in motion.Check out the following section for more design ideas for a SaaS landing page.Explain the outcome of using your productShow its best features in actionWhat problems does this service fix?How do I use it?This section is your service’s calling card. What are you offering, and how does it work?In a few lines, here we learn the purpose of Baremetrics’ Cancellation Insights feature, and are given easily comprehensible oversight into how the tool works.The more specific the ‘how it works’ section is, the better. That doesn’t necessarily mean going into great detail: these annotated screengrabs tell the prospect all they need to know about cancellation insights.Overcome the prospect’s resistance to convert over from their current solution provider/Convince the prospect of why they need this service in the first placeHow is it better than my current solution?Is it worth the hassle of switching over?How will this tool make my life easier?One of the main goals here is to remind prospects of problems and irritations with their current service, and demonstrate to them why you’re better.Baremetrics’s pricing page starts off by asking prospects about their current solution.Whichever option is chosen, the next page explains all the ways in which Baremetrics’ tool is better. It then offers immediate access to the free trial. This approach is especially effective because it’s interactive, and the customized response conveys that the full software experience is also a tailor-made fit.Detail the ways in which your product is the best tool on the marketWhy should I choose your service specifically?What do you offer that your competitors don’t?In the case of this data augmentation tool, the description suggests that this feature offers something new that competitors don’t: tracking of external data.Address potential resistance points and concernsWhat problems could I encounter by switching over to this service?How difficult is the set up?What happens if I change my mind?Are there any leaving penalties or hidden fees?Is this tool cross-compatible with other services I’m using?Each prospect will have their own unique resistance points and concerns. You can head off some of the more common ones as you break down the features of your product.Here’s an example from Baremetrics’s Analytics API feature, addressing the possible concern of cross-compatibility.Set up pricing under the ‘save money’ principle: demonstrate that your tool saves a prospect more money than it costs themIs this service worth the fee?The most effective way to convert a prospect is to show that their business is losing more money by not investing in your service.This is the very first element you see on the landing page of the Baremetrics’s Recover feature.This dunning solution is introduced as a means to recover failed payments and demonstrates that it essentially pays for itself.Basecamp is another great example of proving your worth.In one simple graph, the project management software lists its key tools, gives them clear $ value, and shows the much higher cost of equivalent tools offered by the competition.What your SaaS landing page looks like exactly will of course depend on the type of product you offer.The aesthetic should also be as unique as your team – don’t be afraid to inject some personality!That said, what details should be conveyed is essentially the same across practically all SaaS services.Make sure to address each of these 5 core areas, and make your landing page the calling card your business deserves!Baremetrics is a business tool that tracks over 26 different metrics about your business, including gross and net revenue, income, life-time value and more.

      "MQL vs. PQL vs. SQL: How to Better Qualify Leads.\n",
      "Before the advent of lead qualification, sales and marketing teams would spend way too much trying to convert leads generated during marketing campaigns.With the lead qualification process, there’s now a straightforward way of finding the ideal customer who is most likely to make a purchase.It simply starts with the definition of quality. What do the marketing, sales, and product teams define as a qualified lead? Keep reading to learn about MQLs, PQLs, and SQLs, as well as how Baremetrics can help you track insights about these leads as they progress through your funnel. Start your free trial of Baremetrics today. A marketing qualified lead (MQL)  is a term used to describe prospects who have interacted with a brand’s marketing content and are considered to have a purchase intent.A lead becomes marketing qualified when they perform simple actions like opening emails, website visits, and even providing their contact information on a landing page in exchange for an online resource, for instance, an ebook.The criteria that define an MQL are specific to different organizations. Company X may choose webinar registrations as an MQL behavior while Company Y may choose an MQL as a lead that downloads multiple white papers.These criteria are typically set by considering a lead’s behavior within the customer lifecycle. A product qualified lead (PQL) is a term used to describe prospects who have experienced a brand’s core product or service through a free trial or a freemium usage model. A lead isn’t classified as PQL for simply signing up for a free trial or freemium model.To be considered PQL, a lead would need to perform some predefined tasks before they are classified as product qualified. Every company has their own definition of a PQL, and that definition evolves as the product matures into different stages. A sales qualified lead (SQL) is the term used to classify leads who are considered ready for a sales pitch after experiencing a brand’s various marketing messages. To be considered an SQL, a lead would have to show enough interest in the product or service.Company Y may decide that an SQL is a lead that has had five webinar attendance. SQLs typically move from being MQLs.After MQLs attain a specific lead score (a score assigned to leads for having multiple attributes) or lead behavior, the marketing team will tag them sales-ready. Although the definitions of MQL, PQL, and SQL are subjective and depend entirely on the business model of a specific company, these three lead categorizations form the core pillars of lead generation.Here are some key differentiators of these lead types.Some examples of behaviors of MQLs include downloads of a brand’s content (ebooks, brochures, white papers, and software), submitting forms (mailing list or newsletter), and engagement metrics such as liking, tagging, and tweeting. For example, people who use the free version of Google Hangouts would qualify as PQLs. They’ll need to upgrade to the paid version in order to unlock extra features, which presents a sales opportunity. Examples of SQL behaviors include leads asking about pricing and package offers, leads filling out a “ request a free quote” form, and leads who skip product demos and reach out to a salesperson. Once the definitions of SQLs, PQLs, and MQLs are clear to both the marketing and sales teams, they can work better to ensure that internal communications are efficient and drive growth. With that synergy in place, it’ll form the basis for passing leads to sales. Typically, a lead scoring system is employed within a CRM; leads are scored based on engagement. Those who reach a specific lead score get passed to the sales team along with other relevant information that the marketing and sales synergy would have already discussed. It depends on the team, but sales and marketing teams will usually work together in converting PQLs into paying and repeat customers.First, marketing teams work to get visitors to sign up and become PQLs. Then, sales teams will encourage PQLs to decide which plan is right for them and share  additional offers. With Baremetrics, you can monitor MQLs and their progression through your marketing funnel. To do this, you’ll need to import information using the Baremetrics API or apps like Zapier. Once this data is in Baremetrics, you can use the People Insights tool to segment your customers based on custom attributes. Here are some examples of MQL segments you could create: When users sign up for a free trial, they explore the exciting features of your service, while deciding if it’s the right solution for their needs.  During their trial period, they may decide to connect to data sources like a file, a particular database on a database management system, or even a live data feed.This action could mean a new level of commitment to paying for your service. You could also track the behaviors of clients who are on a free trial. One of such behaviors is usage intensity. Knowing the intensity of usage of free trials is an essential factor in determining how easily they can be converted from PQLs to closed sales. It means that they remember the value derived from the service, hence the usage frequency. Targeting free trial customers with marketing communication and information about their usage usually has a massive impact in encouraging them to retain the service. With Baremetrics, you also can track your product-qualified leads. These are leads who have meaningfully engaged with your product during their free trial. As mentioned earlier you can easily segment your customers and discover meaningful comparative insights after importing data from the source of your choice. Here are some examples of PQL segments you could create. On your dashboard, you can identify your customers on free trial accounts, their sign-up timeframe, and usage intensity. You can also track free trials across various customer segments. With Trial Insights, you can track conversion rate, new trials, and active trials.  You can segment your trial customers based on different categories and easily monitor the customers that show the highest potential for conversion. A crucial part of getting leads to convert is tracking their intent at every stage of the sales funnel. Different behaviors have different meanings and are assigned a level of importance. Here are some examples of ways you could gather insights about SQLs using imported data. If a customer connects their credit card, it’s a strong indicator of purchase intent. On the other hand, if the customer opts out of the product just before they’ve been alerted of an impending debit on their card, then they may not want to make a payment for the service. A drip campaign is a series of emails sent to customers who take specific actions.Suppose you set a drip campaign for free trial customers who use your service for 14 consecutive days. Your drip campaign can offer them a discount when they sign up, or simply suggest a plan that may be better than the one they are currently using. When a customer converts from a free trial to a paid plan, you’ll be notified in the Baremetrics control center. Here you can track their entire journey, starting from when they signed up to the present day. In the Baremetrics app, important events like payments, credit card changes, and upgrades will appear in your customer’s profile. Customers who became paying customers within the last week will appear on the Breakdown in the Baremetrics Control Center under “New Customers.” Efficient sales and marketing teams track leads as they progress through the funnel and get closer to paying for a product or service. By organizing these leads as MQLs, PQLs, and SQLs, teams can focus their efforts, as well as measure the efficacy of different marketing channels. SaaS and subscription businesses rely on Baremetrics to segment customer attributes, track 26+ business metrics, and gather data-driven  insights.

      "Growing traffic into conversions is the ultimate goal for all of us, but is your site stagnating despite all your best efforts?Sure you may have all the textbook strategies in place, integrating applications, subscriptions, site registrations with member discounts, etc. but there is more to it than ‘If you build it they will come’.In short, it’s not what you do, but how you do it. If you’re looking for strategies to push your conversions to new heights – it takes more than simply pushing products out on Google, you need to tap into building a growth focused sales funnel. So what exactly does that entail?You’ve probably  heard of a website funnel, but just in case you haven’t, here is the gist. Traffic pours in from a high level overview of a product and flows down to a point of conversion, whether it be a sale, vote, subscription, or other desired user behavior. Looking at the basics, a conversion funnel is no more than a relationship between Entity ⇾ Action. You present the product (entity) to your target audience via the SERP, and expect a behavior in return. You can determine the typical user journey through the funnel with the following 4 step process:At the surface these steps may seem self-explanatory, but each has its own intricacies for success. Let’s dig into them in more detail.Before plotting out our course, let’s first remember the cardinal rule of any promotion as defined by the marketing guru Simon Sinek.“People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”  -- Simon SinekBy looking back at the four stages of the user journey, let’s build off of these concepts to increase the effectiveness of your funnel during each stage of the buyer’s journey. Expected result: The site is ranked for queries in the subject, and the target audience sees it in search results.Here, our main objective is visibility. In the old days, sites often promoted themselves with the spam and pray method – carpet bomb the www realm with links and emails, hoping for results. These tactics not only no longer work, but are also a fast track to getting filtered out of the SERP. Take it from Forbes, a reputable publication, who learned the hard way when they themselves were penalized in 2011 for selling links.What exactly works today? To increase visibility, you must add valuable and relevant content. If you do this, search engines will begin to view your pages favorably. Here’s how to do it:Google records all requests users make to the search engines. Query statistics will help you discover which phrases your target audience searches for, taking into consideration several factors including geographical region, your personal search history and other habits the search engine monitors.Where can I get query statistics?One way to see Google's query statistics is to use the Keyword Planner tool. It's part of the Google Ads service. To access the planner, you need to log in to Google Ads using Gmail and create an account. Keyword Planner can autocomplete options in the search bar and then reproduce them in a systematic way.Another option is a platform for SEO specialists, which derives statistics from different sources, such as SE Ranking or Ubersuggest, which can help establish key search query variations.How do I search for query variations?First, you need to identify the seed keys of your semantic core, the keywords and phrases of your niche for your target audience to find you. For example, an outdoors outlet may have a large section for camping equipment containing sub-categories for tents, sleeping bags, and other equipment. The name of the game here is to find the balance between relevance, and keyword difficulty. Sure, “camping” sounds great, and describes exactly what we are offering, but if you’re going up against heavy competition who have unlimited budgets, it’ll be quite the uphill climb to get any results… And quite expensive too. Instead, let’s follow a data-driven approach to strike the best effort to reward ratio. Taking your seed words and phrases, you can generate a Keyword Research report in SE Ranking that will detail the difficulty, search volume, and related queries to help define your strategy. Looking at the following table, we can determine:As you see, Similar queries are close to your seed keywords, which usually have the same \"root\" (\"sleeping bag for child,\" \"ultralight sleeping bag\"). The Related columns are variations of the same keywords that are close to the subject. According to them, the same pages are ranked as the ones ranked according to seed keys (\"camping blankets,\" \"outdoor vitals aerie\").Low search volume queries involve three or more words. They are also called long-tail keywords (\"backpacking sleeping bag comparison,\" \"alpine designs sleeping bag 0 degrees\").You may be asking, “which keywords work best for your conversion funnel?” Let’s take a look at picking out the best options.So how do I determine what’s relevant and what’s not?First, retrieve the keywords that match the site's subject and delete the irrelevant ones. For example, the queries \"military sleeping bag\" and \"cotton sleeping bag\" can be removed if they are not in the range of your products. By selecting relevant keys and eliminating unnecessary ones, you form the semantic core of the site.When selecting prospective keywords, such parameters as the query's intent and search volume are important. How do I select queries by intent?Are you focusing on a particular geographic location or a specific purpose for your offers?A query's intent is the user's intention or purpose behind their request to a search engine, e.g., to order a specific service in their city or buy a product from a specific brand. When keywords on a website match the intent of potential customers, this generates high-quality traffic and more conversions.Put yourself in your customer’s place and ask,Examples of queries with different intentsYour goal should be to focus your attention on matching keywords with user intent.For example, “sleeping bag hiking New Hampshire” identifies a specific purpose as well as a geographic location. Keyword modifiers will help you a lot with setting up the particular keyword to the user intent.But what if you have a great semantic core, without getting much traffic? That’s where the search volume plays a critical role.How do I select queries based on search volume?As mentioned above, search volume affects the number of displays and site traffic. Avoid selecting queries that have a very low search volume. At the same time, queries with a very high search volume, as a rule, face more competition, and it is difficult to get to the top positions. The Difficulty parameter helps when evaluating the effort of promoting a keyword. When going through SEO output reports, and unless you have unlimited resources to try to break into the market, steer clear from overly saturated key phrases. We recommend selecting keywords with the optimal search volume and difficulty among that match topic and intent. In the long run you’ll find you get the best bang for your buck.Take a look at the keywords your competitors are focusing on and try to spot any weaknesses in their strategy. You may have noticed that Google doesn’t offer a competitor analysis tool, so be sure to choose an SEO platform that will give you the information you need to rise above the competition.Looking at the following table, do you see any opportunities in the ‘chocolate cafe’ industry?When analyzing your keys, do you notice any similarities between them? An important step is placement, that is ensuring your target audience gets from point A (the SERP) and point B (the product page). This is done by tailoring your keys for a specific landing page. While mixing keywords from different groups on a page is acceptable, best practices are to remain relevant between keywords for optimal results. For example, sites that describe several products. In this case, you should divide the text into thematic blocks, selecting a different key for each one. This will help search engines better identify the subject of the content.Expected result: users find the site pages in search results interesting and relevant to their queries and go to the site.Have you ever searched for something only to find the SERP doesn’t contain the results you’re looking for? This is a common issue, particularly when events such as trending news overshadows your landing page’s intent. For this reason, quality vs quantity will almost always win the day. Focus on providing an excellent user experience that adds value and answers specific search queries. And how do we accomplish this?The right type of content, depending on the niche and the needs of the audience, will help generate user interest. This can be reviews, instructions, news, and other articles. In addition to texts for landing and sales pages (homepage, categories, product, and service descriptions), it is worth creating an article section or blog. Useful texts with the right keywords will attract enthusiasts in your niche and as a result, conversions for the site.Here’s an example of optimizing landing pages:Often, we get lost in the technical aspects of our SEO activities that we forget our ultimate goal of bringing in more traffic. Whether you hire content writers or follow a DIY approach, always take a step back and read through the lens of prospective customers who may have little knowledge of your offerings.As an uninformed browser, ask yourself the following questions: does your site look appealing? Will it answer my questions? Will it provide me with the products I need?Once you have the scope of the reader’s perspective, we can then focus on having the technical requirements mould into the needs of the audience.Experience has shown that SEO is an ever evolving process. Even thinking about trends from a few years ago… Ice bucket challenges, Pokemon Go, Justin Bieber, we can see that staying on top of the SERP is never a finished process.Landing page improvement and updating is the back-bone of maintaining high organic search rankings to get customers to find their way to your conversion funnel.It’s highly recommended when putting together your SEO strategies for key pages, to periodically re-run an analysis to ensure your original strategy is still within the scope of current trends.Be sure to eliminate dated content and replace it with something fresh for readers to take interest in.Ever have an impulse for a coffee or a bite to eat and couldn’t be bothered typing in your search? You’re not alone. Voice search is hot and it’s not going away.According to Invespcro, voice shopping is targeted to hit over $40 billion in the USA by 2022.. To optimize your site for voice search, add keywords that are as close to spoken language as possible, i.e.,“Who was William Henry Harrison”, “Where to find cheap gas”, “What concerts are tonight”.People click with their eyes and the appearance of a page in the SERP determines its clickability. Create informative and attractive snippets to help increase the organic CTR. Let's discover what points you need to include in your SEO strategy to boost the effectiveness of your pages in SERPs.Anyone who’s been involved with naming a brand or project knows the never ending back and forth of finding that perfect name that sounds interesting and describes a product.Presentation is everything, especially in SEO, but here we are lucky as the goal is to be as informative and concise as possible.So what goes into drafting the best title and description for your site’s snippet? First, the title and description must be unique. It is also important to maintain the optimal length when filling them out.There are no strict rules about the number of words, but consider that about 60-70 characters for the title and 160-180 for the Description will generally fit on a SERP. To increase CTR, add call-to-action phrases, structural elements, and emoji to your snippets. How do rich snippets differ from the usual ones with the title and description? Additional elements – star ratings, cost, product availability, a FAQ section, and others. Such snippets are more informative, and attract more attention. Usually, Featured snippets appear when a user is looking for an answer to a question or information like \"what is it,\" \"how to do it,\" \"where is it,\" \"top of the best,\" and so on.But how do you get rich snippets?For your pages to be displayed as a rich snippet in the SERP, you will need to add micro-markup to the HTML code by attributing the proper data types to various content fragments.There are several ways to do this, for instance, by using a special CMS plugin or Google's Markup Helper. When you add these features, your search presence will pop-out to users and generate more interest to your pages.Having a few snippets is not a guarantee they will display on the SERP. It's up to Google to decide when to generate featured snippets and which sites to show in this block.Still, more often, such results display pages that are already in the top 10 for similar queries and have well-structured content, with a text related to the question and a clear answer to it.So, the best way to get your rich snippets to display in the results, is to ensure the pages are highly optimized with valuable content that stands out amongst your competitors.Even if your site features compelling content paired with the best keywords and graphics, a technically inept site will fall to the depths of the SERP. So let’s take a look at how technical SEO drives behavior and builds conversions.Expected result: The site's content meets user expectations. They can easily find the information they need and see value in the resource.No matter how useful your content is and how exceptional your website structure, slow loading speed, and incorrectly displayed pages can wash away all your efforts. Several optimization techniques can help improve a site’s usability, make a positive impression on users, and lead visitors to purchase. Here’s how we guide the user to the decision making process. If we take a look into changes Google made to its ranking algorithms In 2021, we see they started taking Core Web Vitals into account. What are Core Web Vitals?They determine how quickly and correctly the content of pages is displayed. Here are a few elements Google references.The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) indicates how quickly large elements are displayed. First Input Delay (FID) indicates the period from clicking on the URL in search results to the response of the browser displaying the page. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is an indicator of the shift of page elements as they load.The rule of thumb is to think lean with the design of your landing pages. You can best achieve this by minimizing Javascript, compressing image files, and using thumbnails where practical and rewriting any spaghetti code that may exist.You can view the Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console (if you verify your rights to the site) and other SEO services.You may be thinking that graphics and videos are key drivers in moving products, which is true.But imagine you’re on a site that seems to have exactly what you are looking for but the page takes forever to load so you click back and choose the next option on the SERP rendering all those images and video presentations useless.To avoid this, analyze the size of images with special tools and find and optimize bulky files.In short – Adaptive website. On the go and need to find out what’s playing in the cinema tonight? Heading home from work and don’t feel like cooking, but you’re in the mood for Thai food? Friends ask what you want to do tonight and you want to check what events are downtown? Mobile devices are taking over the digital marketplace and for good reason – convenience.More and more users convert using smartphones compared to laptops.If a website doesn’t display properly, content doesn't fit on the screen, or loads too slowly, users bounce and the number of conversions fall. Not to mention, Google prioritizes sites that feature mobile adaptability.To keep your site in the top, analyze the quality of your website's adaptability for smartphones and improve these metrics.Factors to consider: the presence of a viewport tag responsible for display on different screen sizes, the text to HTML ratio, which affects speed, and others.Looking at your site, do you notice some pages getting a lot of traffic, but no results? Perhaps there are even cases when users spend a good amount of time on your site but sales remain flat, why is this? The exact way a user interacts with a website helps find the strengths and weaknesses of the resource. Here are a few indicators that will be useful for analysis.A list of the URLs which users come to a site. It helps find the most effective pages in terms of traffic and those that need to be improved.The time from the moment a user enters the site to the end of a session makes it possible to identify pages and keywords that lead to shorter sessions. Typically, this indicates that the page content is not meeting user expectations. The reason could be content, poor usability, or other issues.With this indicator, you can find out the number of users who didn't view more than one page on the site. Similar to Average Session Duration, it helps find and fix weaknesses in the content and internal optimization.If a visitor has viewed more than one page, this indicates the desire to learn more or perform an action on the site.As with other parameters, it is worth tracking the correlation of pages/sessions with keywords.Expected result: visitors to a website make conversions, and tracking those actions allows you to deepen your analytics, know the conversion rate of all keywords, and use this information in different SEO strategies.So now we’ve made it to the primary objective of the user journey, building our customer base. Let's see how to analyze user actions on a website and link that data with SEO to get the conversion funnel flowing with velocity.Building yourself some benchmarks is a great way to generate a site report card to measure expected results vs actual results and will give you a starting point to measure the success of your efforts.One way to track conversions is to set up Goals in Google Analytics, defining the desired actions of visitors to the site. For example, you can specify the URL of the landing page, the expected duration of content viewing, and the action (filling out a form, subscribing to a newsletter) as the goal.As a result, the system will record all of the specified user actions, and you'll get more detailed and informative statistics.Earlier we covered in detail the importance of selecting the right keywords and building your semantic core… But did we choose wisely?Conversion tracking allows not only analyzing the traffic to target actions ratio but also seeing which keywords are most effective for the website. You should pay more attention to them by increasing optimization and monitoring their positions in search results using a rank tracker like keyword.com.In the beginning we may have selected what we thought were the best keywords, phrases, and placements on landing pages, but the SERP tells a different story. Tracking our conversions will give us a sobering story if our semantic core isn’t working and it’s time to make adjustments.Marketing is one of those games that can be a bit unpredictable. From emerging trends to search engines re-working their algorithms, frequent changes are to be expected. That’s why your company’s investment in SEO should be seen as a work in progress. With the help of the SEO techniques above, you’re able to increase your website's efficiency at all stages of the funnel. What are you waiting for?

      "What is Recurring Billing?.\n",
      "Most SaaS businesses adopt a subscription-based model supported by a recurring payment system.Setting up a recurring payment system can be complicated and requires the right tools to measure, manage, and review payments regularly. Recurring billing happens when a merchant automatically charges a customer for a service on a prearranged schedule. It requires the customer to sign up and provide their information and permission.After that, the vendor makes recurring charges with no further permissions required. That typically continues throughout the customer lifecycle until the client terminates the subscription or a pre-agreed upon expiration date is reached. Processing such payments can be complex. However, you can read more about choosing a payment processor on the Baremetrics blog and sign up for a Baremetrics demo to see what recurring revenue metrics and insights would look like in your company. Generally, there are two methods of setting up recurring billing. First, the company must set up a recurring billing merchant bank account to take deposits from credit or debit cards.Yet, having a merchant bank account does not include the processing and actual delivery of  payments from your customers.Therefore, companies typically outsource the entire process to a payment service provider, such as Stripe. Stripe can process and deposit funds and meet the compliance requirements for security and recurring billing.  When using a payment service provider, such as Stripe, customers can choose their recurring payment option when they opt for a specific product or service tier on the SaaS website. The payment service provider will take care of everything from prompting the customers for credit card numbers, to sending payments between accounts. After accepting the terms and conditions and receiving authorization, customers just provide their payment information and agree to the amount they have to pay. Recurring Payments are usually made daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. Customers typically receive a receipt or notification when billing is processed, either via email or text message.  Recurring billing can be fixed or variable. Fixed recurring billing charges a customer the same amount each time, like a Netflix subscription or gym membership. When customers are charged using variable recurring billing, the payment amount depends on the cost of the services the customer uses during the payment period. The most common example of variable recurring billing is a cell phone or utility bill that varies depending on your usage for the month. Recurring billing can be used by businesses that offer their services on a recurring basis, such as telecom companies with metered billing, newspaper subscriptions, or SaaS applications like Slack or Dropbox. By using recurring billing, companies benefit from consistent cash flow, an ongoing relationship with their customers, and a lower barrier to entry.That said, there are not only benefits for businesses, but for customers, too. With recurring billing, especially recurring billing facilitated by a payment provider, customers reduce the time and effort they spend on manual billing and are much less likely to miss a payment leading to a disruption in service. Most of us encounter recurring billing on a day-to-day basis. Some companies charge a flat rate, such as the eCommerce Saas platform Carthook.Carthook charges $300 per month for access to all features. There are no fees for additional usage or seats. Monday.com or Jira are good examples of standard recurring billing based on the number of seats. If more users are added, pricing goes up.Companies like SaaS social media management platform Storrito sell usage plans based on the number of social media posts they help their users publish per month or year.Few SaaS companies get billing right from the start. Churn, demand, growth, and changing customer expectations may see your billing strategy change over time.This is why it is crucial to keep an eye on your subscription and revenue analytics. It’s also crucial to manage your accounts receivable through tools such as Recover.Baremetrics provides subscription analytics for individual brands and companies that are running Subscription Billing through a payment provider service. This includes monitoring for Monthly Recurring Revenue, Annual Run Rate, subscriptions, subscription value, and more. Baremetrics can integrate with most billing software solutions, including Stripe, Checkout, Shopify, and more. View a live demo now to see how everything works. There are advantages and disadvantages to recurring billing for businesses and consumers. Fortunately, the positives far outweigh the negatives:Businesses typically find that recurring billing is straightforward and accessible, with low risks. They can also set up clients with a free trial and then sign them to a recurring payment schedule when the trial ends. Other benefits include: As with everything, recurring payments are not without drawbacks. Companies must use the right tools to track and manage their recurring billing subscriptions integrated with their existing software platforms.Some of the disadvantages to recurring billing include:Keeping track of recurring revenue is nearly impossible without proper subscription analytics. Using a tool like Baremetrics is almost essential to keeping it all straight. Still, most of the cons are overcome or at least managed with the right analytics and insights at your disposal. Most SaaS companies use the MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) model. However, no SaaS company is compelled to use a recurring revenue model. Recurring revenue is just a monetization strategy, one of many to choose from, in fact. Some SaaS companies sell the use of their platform at a fixed price and don't charge for upgrades. Microsoft, for example, sells technology as a unit at a fixed price. Licensing fees apply, and new releases have to be bought as they roll out. Most SaaS companies opt for an MRR model because it is highly beneficial for them and their customers. The SaaS model is so popular because it offers flexibility and scalability, even as customers' needs change.Customers can scale up or down, add features or remove them when they need to. Month-to-month subscriptions allow them to stay agile. Use Stripe Billing to bill customers with subscriptions and capture your recurring payments globally. Here's how to set it up:Setting up recurring payments with Stripe is free, but each recurring transaction costs 2.9% plus a flat rate of 0.30 USD. Baremetrics is a subscription analytics platform, enabling businesses to monitor their customer's recurring monthly revenue, lifetime revenue, and churn rate. Your ARR or Annual Recurring Revenue is your recurring revenue per annum. In a SaaS business, you'll regularly see new customers joining and existing customers leaving, which can cause your monthly revenue to fluctuate.MRR captures the movement to show whether or not your revenue is growing or shrinking, giving you an overview of the financial health of your business. It also makes it easier to forecast your future revenue so that you can make decisions about investing, scaling, or budgeting. Check out this example of monitoring MRR and ARR in Baremetrics:Your Customer Lifetime Value helps you measure how valuable a client is over time, then you can compare that to the cost of acquiring that customer (CAC). You need to have this data available at a glance to help plan out your marketing and sales. Your churn rate measures the rate at which customers stop doing business with your organization (e.g., cancel subscriptions). Unsurprisingly, you need to keep churn rates low to maintain a healthy business.Baremetrics also provides insight into dunning, helping companies recover revenue due to payment errors such as failed credit cards. On top of that, Baremetrics offers revenue and subscription forecasting tools for detailed insights into your financials.Manually tracking new customers, upgrades, and lost customers is considerably challenging, especially if you offer customization or usage-based billing. So, it’s a good idea to use a recurring revenue analytics tool so you can actually see how much money you’re making. Recurring revenue isn't the only monetization method SaaS companies use, but it's an effective one. Start a Baremetrics about a free trial to take control of your recurring revenue streams. \n"

      "Earned and Incurred Accounting: What’s the difference?.\n",
      "Depending on the accounting method your company chooses (or is forced to use by tax authorities), two words that you will come across regularly are “incurred” and “earned”. Let’s take a look at incurred revenue, earned revenue, and all the related accounting principles.When money comes in and services are rendered on different timelines, it can be difficult to keep track of what invoices have been collected and who is still owed services. Baremetrics can help you keep track of your growing business by providing 26 metrics about your business: MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, etc. Let's go through how that works below together.There are two main types of accounting. The first, accrual accounting, is mentioned above, while the second is cash accounting. Let’s take a look at them before we move on. As stated above, according to many tax authorities, SaaS companies must use the accrual accounting system, which stipulates that you record earned revenue only following the revenue recognition principle. In the case of a subscription revenue stream, this means when you have fulfilled your part of the service agreement. The following two subscription revenue examples will make this point clear. Example 1: Your company offers a discount to clients that pay their bill annually instead of monthly. You have five clients that take advantage of the discount. These invoices total $120,000. Since you must provide services to these clients for an entire year and assuming your income statements are drafted monthly, GAAP standards stipulate that you should move $10,000 at the end of each month into your revenue account and keep the remaining unearned subscription revenue in a deferred revenue account as you have not yet earned the money.Example 2:Your company bills clients at the end of the month for the services you’ve provided during the month. Most of your clients pay within the allowed time period, but some—due to issues with the payment system, the invoice hitting the spam folder, among many other reasons—do not pay on time. In this case, even though you are earning $10,000 at the end of each month, you may not be receiving all of it until some days, weeks, or months later—or, unfortunately, sometimes not at all. In this case, you still recognize the earned revenue of $10,000 each month using an accounts receivable journal entry and then later move the revenue to your cash account when you receive the payments.In the first case, you have more cash on hand than your company has actually earned. In the second case, you have less cash on hand than you have earned, and you might not even receive all the money you have earned. This shows the importance of keeping track of your incurred expenses and earned revenue on the one hand and your cash position and cash flows on the other hand.Similarly, expenses must be recognized when they are incurred regardless of when the invoice is paid. This is done by matching the expenses to the revenue they generate where possible. When this is not easily possible, then either the “systemic and rational allocation method” or the “immediate allocation method” can be used. The former allocates expenses over the useful life of the product, while the latter recognizes the entire expense when purchased.Let’s consider a few examples for when expenses should be recognized. \n",
      "Alternative Marketing Strategies for SaaS Businesses.\n",
      "The phone rings. It’s the sales rep from that new gym you’ve been checking out. Do you pick up? Or do you dismiss the call after a few rings?If you chose not to answer the phone, you’d be in the majority. And that holds true even if you had every intention of signing up for the membership.It all comes down to the simple fact that most people do not like talking to sales representatives.If you’re in sales: it’s not you, I promise. I’m sure you’re lovely. And a great listener. People love talking to you on the phone – just not necessarily when you’re selling something.Now why is that?There are a few psychological factors at play here.The first is scepticism. Our predecessors had to learn the hard way not to be quite so trusting. That fallen tree over there? Look again mate, that’s a crocodile and it took Bruce last Friday. Tempted by those delicious-looking berries? Go on, you’ll be dead by sundown.In the modern day, we apply much of that same scepticism to our financial and emotional survival.Generally speaking, we don’t blindly trust the packaging, we check the list of ingredients.This item is on sale? Great, but is it actually good value, and do I really need it?This platform is free to use, but how will my private data be handled?These are very important questions to be asking, and show that we’ve gotten wise to some of the more questionable marketing tactics and business practices we’ve been subjected to over the decades.Unfortunately, this also means that our guard is up even when it comes to being sold a product or service that can actually help us.It’s an innately natural response to feel that the more someone tries to convince us of something, the more we want to resist.This brings us to a need for control.When the phone rings, or an email pops into our inbox, we are put in a reactive position. We don’t control the timing, and we don’t control the narrative.And not being the driving force in a situation rubs a lot of people the wrong way right out the gate - especially founders who’ve essentially built a business on proactivity.I’m not saying ‘don’t call founders’. I’m saying, consider how you can hand over some of that control, whether real or illusionary. It could even be small things, like letting them decide the timing for a call.Finally, there’s an implied promise in taking a sales call. Knowing that the other party has a specific goal that we have the sole power to either fulfil or deny, adds stakes to a conversation.We might even feel indebted to a sales rep for taking up their time.This puts pressure on buyers and makes them feel guilty for not fulfilling the wishes of the sales rep.Essentially, these three factors can make a prospect feel like they’re always on the back foot. As a sales person, knowing that it’s most likely not your fault that prospects aren’t answering your calls is but small consolation when it’s affecting your sales numbers. However, understanding the psychology behind this phenomenon can help you improve not only your approach, but your entire campaign strategy. So how do we combat these psychological tripwires?The solution is anathema to most marketing strategies: take away the goal of selling anything.Yes, spending campaign money that might never see returns is risky and counter-intuitive. In any case, the results will be unpredictable, and perhaps only come to fruition in the long term.Something magical happens, however, when you take away the pressure to buy.The connections you make through alternative marketing run on different tracks entirely to the usual sales funnel: instead of converting prospects, you develop business partnerships, form long-term trust relationships with peers, and build your brand identity.Here are a few ideas on alternative marketing strategies:Tip 1: Build communityTip 2: create a word-of-mouth buzzTip 3: make high-touch contactAre you looking for in-depth insights into your business metrics? Baremetrics tracks over 26 different metrics, and is currently holding a free trial.Hosting events is a great opportunity to meet and develop a community of business partners, peers, and potential customers.Some ideas of occasions to create events for include company anniversaries, achieving a major business milestone such as funding or acquisition, change in leadership, new hires, and launching a new campaign.You could treat these events as customer discovery too, and ask participants for light feedback on your services.The point is that community-driven events shouldn’t revolve directly around sales at all.Instead, these are an opportunity for your community to see the values that you as the founder, as well as your business, are built upon.Depending on what’s feasible for your business and what makes sense for your product, these events can be in person or online, and range from invite-only curated dinners to open attendance pop-up stalls.Note that if you’re hosting an online event, it’s especially important to create an incentive for people to actually show up and participate. This could be through raffle prizes, information give outs, or simply sending out quality RSVP cards.This will also help allocate your marketing funds more effectively – if someone can’t commit to an RSVP, they certainly won’t commit to your business long-term.Another method of community-building is through information sharing.When you’re in the starting phases of customer discovery, blogs, video content, and podcasts with good SEO are powerful tools for attracting a wide range of people, some of whom could eventually become clients based on the quality of your content.You might consider giving this community a voice by hosting a comment section, or another means to respond to your content to attract more engagement.It’s usually a good idea to separate your marketing outbound domain from your main business domain, and this goes double for any community-uploaded content. Remember, you can always import some of those contributions (with permission from the authors, of course) to your main business profile as testimonials.Take your community to the next step by offering workshops and mentorship.Ideally, workshops should be monetised, not only to offset some of the costs of your alternative marketing campaign but also to encourage participants to truly commit. When it comes to information, people really do value paid content over the free variety.Even though the educational route in alternative marketing takes a less direct approach to sales, this doesn’t mean you’re not looking for long-term returns. The goal is absolutely for a proportion of workshop participants to eventually become customers, business partners, or even your new team-members.To reap the full benefits of this approach, you need to commit to keeping people engaged in your content longer-term. If this level of commitment to the indirect sales approach isn’t practicable for your business in the long term, read on to the next tip on shorter term content ideas.Going viral and getting people to recommend your services without recompense is not a process you can fully control. But there are a few things you can do to further your organic reach.Collaborations are a prime example. Contacting related businesses to run a joint campaign will not only allow you to reach each other’s audiences, but could also give you some fresh ideas for your own startup.In order to find potential partners, think of services that are compatible with yours, but not in direct competition. As a SaaS business, your immediate ‘product neighbours’ likely include online payment systems, project management tools, and any other tools that your customers also use.Of course, you can also go further afield and collaborate with any business with whom a joint campaign makes sense.Let’s say your SaaS provides a service that helps reduce paper waste and energy consumption. Environmental groups would make great partners for a ‘Go Green’ campaign.Another way to achieve word-of-mouth attention is to be featured by influencers and content creators active in your field. These promotions could be paid, equivalently reward-based, or in some cases purely organic.The closer the content of a given medium aligns with your services, the more audience members will be interested in converting to your product.The benefit of this is that instead of having to build up a following of your own, you have access to the existing audiences of content creators across a multitude of channels and interests.If eventually you did want to invest in creating a social media following of your own, you have a few ‘media personas’ to choose between, all the way from the ‘informative blog’ like Baremetrics, to the ‘merciless roast channel’ like the Wendy’s infamous twitter account.In his book How to Get a Meeting with Anyone, famous Wall Street Journal cartoonist Stu Heinecke describes his tactics for scheduling meetings even with the most elusive of people.How? With an arsenal of unique, high-touch campaign strategies that include, you guessed it, drawing cartoons.Is this approach effective? Yes.Is this method fool-proof and efficient? Absolutely not. So use it wisely.And by ‘this method’, I don’t exclusively mean ‘draw cartoons’. What your upper echelons of personalised contact look like is entirely up to you!In essence, this high-touch approach is a ‘special occasions’ kind of contact to be reserved for the most promising of prospects, and potential business partners of VIP status.Now what if I told you that there’s a cheat code?With new technology ever evolving, software can now emulate a high-touch approach that requires only a small amount of customisation.Lemlist offers one such service. Its artificial intelligence creates custom images and video content that appears to be unique to the prospect. How does it work?Essentially, the customisation process is the same as for any cold email template.It’s a broadly one-size-fits-all email that contains a personalised hook adapted to each prospect.In the case of a video message, the custom-made hook is a recorded screen-grab of the prospect’s home page, while the other side of the spliced video featuring the sales person remains exactly the same.Here’s what that looks like. On the left is a template recording of the sales rep. On the right is a screengrab of the prospect’s own pricing page.Of course, the video and audio won’t sync properly for any customised lines, such as the prospect’s name. This is masked quite easily with a small glitch effect that looks like a buffering issue.Ingenious, right?In a few years, this approach might become standard. As it stands, this technology is pretty novel, and rarely fails to create quite the first impression.The take-away: don’t hesitate to use technology in unorthodox ways!Ultimately, alternative marketing is underpinned by three core concepts:In a world where we’re incessantly being sold to, that feels incredibly liberating. The second is, don’t be afraid to experiment with new methods, new technologies, and lean into what makes your SaaS unique.And finally: however you do it, make the first contact meaningful.SaaS businesses can greatly benefit from tracking financial insights.

      "Everything You Need to Know About ARR.\n",
      "The advent of cloud-based SaaS offerings has revolutionized the way of doing business. Gone are the days where software used to be purchased based on a one-time license or developed in-house. Now companies want to focus on their core problems and not be distracted by developing applications for auxiliary functions.SaaS offerings facilitate this flexibility. SaaS companies generate their revenue from the subscription payments that customers pay for using their software. This revenue goes into maintaining the service’s infrastructure, developing new features, fixing existing problems, and marketing the product further to increase its reach.The eventual profit of a SaaS organization is the difference between the subscription revenue and the cost incurred in doing the above-mentioned activities.As with any business, there are specific metrics that help top management run organizations and track the progress towards their target. If you are part of such an organization and want to use such metrics to understand more about your business, check out Baremetrics.This post is about Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), a key metric for measuring the success of a SaaS offering.Annual recurring revenue, as the name suggests, is the total forecasted annual revenue of a SaaS company based on the subscription contracts it has garnered. It only measures the income that is guaranteed and excludes all one-time or trial subscriptions.This means ARR is generally calculated based on year-long or multi-year contracts. Even if the payment is made on a month-to-month basis, if there is a contractual arrangement or auto-renewal agreement, then the revenue forecasted is included in ARR.That said, the calculations vary from business to business, and some organizations include all clients that they are reasonably sure will stay with the product. The critical element is that ARR considers the churn of customers and hence can be a good indicator of how well the product is doing.For a company that sells its products or services based on subscriptions, ARR is a critical metric that tells the story of its whole business model. Let’s explore why it is essential in measuring business success.ARR takes into consideration all the existing customers of the company that the organization is confident they will retain. This means it provides a reasonably accurate assessment of the current state of the business. Only an unforeseen circumstance with disastrous effects on the company’s infrastructure or service-providing abilities would trigger a change in the state deduced via ARR.ARR helps organizations forecast their profit for the entire year ahead. ARR can be considered as the minimum revenue the company will get even if it does not win any new clients or upgrades for the rest of the year, so it helps the organization to set a baseline for their revenue forecasts.The whole point of a subscription business model is hoping that people will continue to pay for its services for the foreseeable future. ARR helps in asserting this and gives an indication to the management of whether the subscription business model is a viable alternative in that specific domain.ARR considers only subscription revenue. In that sense, it is different from total revenue, which may include other sources of income such as one-time payments or add-on products, so it helps management focus only on specific products and the customers that use that product. It is also possible to calculate the ARR of individual products if the company has multiple products in its portfolio.As mentioned above, ARR denotes the minimum revenue the company can garner in that year. Hence, it plays an important role in deciding how much money can be spent on product features, sales promotions, employee appraisals, etc.ARR should only be used by organizations that earn most of their revenue from subscriptions. Such organizations generally run based on customer relationships, and the churn of customers is a big factor in the business’s success. Using ARR for measuring business success only makes sense in organizations that meet the following conditions.Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly in your Baremetrics dashboard. Just check out this demo account here.Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources, and start seeing all of your revenue on a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments. Since ARR provides an accurate picture of the health of a company, it can be used in many ways to improve business outcomes.Since ARR gives a real-time metric about the health of your business, it is very valuable when you are trying to get investors to grow your organization. If your business is predominantly subscription-based, investors only need to look at this single metric to get an idea about your current status. A cursory look into how your ARR has varied over a period of time will give investors all the information they need to assess your potential. ARR provides an accurate forecast of how a company’s finances will look in a year’s time. Hence, it gives senior management visibility into how much money is available for product development and allows them to plan the feature rollouts to prioritize the most loyal or tentative customers depending on the circumstances. ARR helps set goals that are achievable but not too easy at the same time. An organization with a low ARR has infinite potential to grow, and the senior management can pursue aggressive growth targets. On the other hand, an organization that already has a high ARR like Netflix or Amazon Prime can only grow them at a lower rate. Managers can prioritize steady growth vs. risky aggressive growth based on the current value of ARR and how it has varied.Variation of ARR over a period of time gives you an idea about how well your sales team is performing. You can even analyze ARR in a granular way to find out which sales group brings in the most revenue or has the highest ARR. A positive change in ARR can be incentivized as a good motivational metric for the sales team.Recurring revenue calculations help to determine the budget that you have access to even before the annual or quarterly reports are out. Offering raises at critical times is a key element of retaining employees. Having access to real-time ARR helps you make quick budgeting decisions to retain your star employees.ARR is calculated by considering the total amount of yearly subscriptions, the number of yearly upgrades committed, and the number of cancellations.The formula for calculating ARR is as follows: For example, if you have three customers that have agreed to buy the subscription at $10 per month, then the revenue from yearly subscription revenue normalized for the year is 3 ✕ $10 ✕ 12 = $360.Now, imagine that one customer upgraded to a pro membership for an extra $2 per month in March. The second element of ARR, the revenue from recurring upgrades for the rest of the year, becomes $2 ✕ 9 where 9 is the remaining number of months.Similarly, if a customer canceled their subscription, then the third element, the revenue lost from cancellation, becomes $10 ✕ 12 = $120.The ARR is thus $360 + $18 − $120 = $258. As evident from above, it is very difficult to accommodate cancellations that happen in the middle of the year in ARR. So, ARR is best used when you have reasonable confidence in the contracts signed by your customers. An alternative that can be considered here is MRR, which is better when most of your contracts are short term.Other than ARR and MRR, there are many relevant metrics that can help in measuring the success of a SaaS business. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is a key metric that can help in knowing your customers better and deciding which ones are worth your attention. It is calculated by multiplying the annual revenue by the average customer lifetime. Another metric is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), which indicates how much the company needs to spend on average to onboard one customer.The key to succeeding in business is measuring the current state and setting realistic goals. Metrics like ARR are an important part of that puzzle. The smart analytics tools provided by Baremetrics help you uncover these metrics and their meaning from the information you already have. Intuitive dashboards help management to better understand their products, sales teams, and customers.Interested in reducing churn, driving growth, and making decisions with data-backed confidence?

      "What Is Owner’s Equity in SaaS?.\n",
      "Few business owners are as passionate about what they do as those of SaaS companies. Baremetrics has supported hundreds of SMEs with comprehensive analytics as they develop, build and maintain their business over time. In fact, many of these owners remain in the industry for years, while others sell their businesses for a healthy profit.In both cases, these businesses need to understand the owner’s equity to make strategic decisions about the company’s future. The owner’s equity is used to obtain investment loans or when selling a company as an investment.Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources and start seeing all of your revenue on a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenue now.Owner’s equity is the proportion of the total value of an organization’s assets that its owners and shareholders can claim. To calculate the owner’s equity, add up the book value of all your assets.Assets can either be current or non-current assets. Current assets are any items that can be converted to cash within a year, such as inventory or accounts receivable. Your non-current or long-term assets are items that aren’t consumed or converted to cash within a fiscal year, including real estate properties, equipment, patents, etc.Once you’ve established the value of your assets, all the liabilities (loans, payroll, accounts payable, etc.) are deducted from the total amount. The amount left after the deduction is the owner’s equity or net worth.For example, if you have $400,000 of assets in your company and took a loan of $300,000 to cover expenses, your owner’s equity is $100,000.Your owner’s equity increases when the owner or partners increase their capital contribution or if profits increase through sales. Your owner’s equity is lowered by making withdrawals, the depreciation of assets, or any losses.First and foremost, owner’s equity helps you evaluate your finances. At the same time, it helps you make crucial decisions about expansion and maintenance. You can compare your owner’s equity from one period to the next to determine if you’re gaining or losing value over time. Remember, when you’re seeking financing, you need to show equity to investors and lenders.Furthermore, the owner’s equity only shows the book value of the business and not the market value. Market value is the price of assets sold, while book value reflects the purchased amount of an asset. Therefore, your market value can be either higher or lower than the book value because of your business’s earning potential and revenue.Owner’s equity includes the money invested by the owner of the business and the profits generated since its inception, minus any funds taken out of the company or lost by the business. In the case the company is structured as a corporation and ownership is widely held by shareholders, your equity will also include the following.Companies may opt to distribute their profits as dividends to shareholders or retain and reinvest the money into the business. The funds kept on the balance sheet and not paid out in dividends form a part of equity.The shares of a corporation issued and purchased by investors are known as outstanding shares. In other words, these are the shares on the open market held by insiders and company officers. However, outstanding shares can fluctuate if the company issues new ones when exercising employee stock options or raising extra capital. These decrease in number if the company repurchases shares.Treasury stock or treasury shares are previously outstanding stock bought back from shareholders and held by the company. Companies often do this if they feel their stock is undervalued. To raise the market value of the remaining shares and earnings per share, the company might reduce the circulating number of outstanding shares through repurchasing. Additional paid-in capital or contributed capital is the amount paid for shares above their par value. Simply put, it’s the amount of money investors paid for shares above their nominal value. It cannot be distributed as dividends.While owner’s equity is calculated based on the assets owned by the company, it isn’t reflected as an asset on the balance sheet. Technically speaking, owner’s equity is the assets of the business owner and not the business itself.Business assets are all the items of value owned by the company, while owner’s equity represents the owner’s claim to what would be leftover if the business sold all of its assets and settled its debts.The owner’s equity can be either negative or positive depending on the company’s balance of assets and liabilities.If a business’s liabilities are more significant than its assets, the owner’s equity will be negative, and the owner may wish to invest additional capital in the company to cover the shortfall. Negative owner’s equity can have tax implications, too. If the owner draws money from the business, the draws are taxable as capital gains.It’s critical that the business monitors its capital accounts and avoids withdrawals if the balance is negative. Read more about the importance of understanding equity as a start-up on our blog.The owner’s equity is recorded on your balance sheet at the end of the accounting period. Assets are shown on the left side, while, on the right side, you can find the liabilities and owner’s equity.Keep in mind that the owner’s equity is always indicated as a net amount, showing the amount of money taken out as withdrawals by the owner or partners throughout a designated accounting period. The company will also maintain a capital account that reveals the net equity resulting from the owner’s investments.Finding owner’s equity isn’t rocket science, as basic math is more than enough.Just deduct liabilities from the total value of assets to calculate it:Owner’s Equity = Total Assets – Total LiabilitiesThe same calculation also determines shareholder’s equity if the company is a registered corporation.The fundamental difference between the balance sheet of a SaaS company and other businesses is the way revenue is generated. To determine your net profit, you’ll need several metrics on hand, including: This metric represents the average annual contract value of a customer subscription, including new bookings and renewals. Additionally, you’ll also need to account for lost ACV that occurred through churn. Keep an eye on your ACV in Baremetrics.This includes your total subscription and usage-based revenue for the year. Companies selling physical products would list the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) on their income statement, but SaaS companies use the Cost of Revenue (COR) instead. They are the direct costs incurred by delivering your product in the accounting period. That can include hosting and infrastructure costs, customer support, cloud operations, third-party software, or data fees.Operating expenses include marketing, administration, and product development. These costs determine your net profits, found at the bottom of your income statement. Net profit can also be recorded on the balance sheet under retained earnings if it is not, for example, divested through dividends.Your shareholders’ equity is calculated in the same way as the owner’s equity where a sole proprietorship or partnership is registered. It represents the total dollar amount that would be returned to shareholders if its total assets were sold and debts settled.Shareholders’ equity is also recorded on the balance sheet at the end of a financial reporting period and determines financial health.The simple calculation is:As a business owner, understanding your equity is vital to determining your growth and your business’s potential if sold as an investment. You can’t assess your equity without understanding your revenue, which is why you need a comprehensive tool designed to measure and manage your critical SaaS metrics.Baremetrics is a metrics, forecasting, and engagement tool for SaaS businesses.

      "Sales Outbound 101: The Best Tools for Startups.\n",
      "An effective sales outbound strategy needs to balance two opposing elements: efficiency vs. personal touch.There are dozens of templates out there for writing killer cold emails. But even the most brilliantly drafted email will remain ignored if the receiver doesn’t connect with its content.On the flipside, who has the time to spend ten minutes on each prospecting email with no guarantee of returns? Nobody—and certainly not the busy founder.Luckily, these days we have access to sophisticated software to help solve that exact problem.Do you want to know how to connect with your ideal customers, send them automated customized emails, and avoid landing in the spam bucket—or, worse, Google SEO’s naughty list?Then take a look at our favorite tools for supporting you through all stages of outreach.Are you looking for insights into your business metrics? Take a look at over 26 different metrics using Baremetrics.The best emails are the ones that go straight to the right people. It doesn’t matter how good the pitch is if the audience isn’t in the market for what you’re offering.By now you should know your ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) (and if not, here’s a guide on determining your ICP), but how do you reach them? We recommend starting with LinkedIn’s own Sales Navigator.Let’s say your ICP is a web developer running a startup on the East Coast. Using Sales Navigator’s search engine, you can filter results by plugging in various titles, locations, industries, company headcounts, and so on, to come as close as you can to your ICPs.With advanced automation, you could also extract LinkedIn search results to your CRM.You can get pretty granular with this, such as selecting how many years someone has been in their current job position.The goal is not to compile one master list of all your possible ICPs—it’s much more effective to run different searches for specific types of people, gathering up to 1000 people per list.There are two reasons for this. Firstly, for the next steps to work correctly, this data has to interface with other pieces of software that just don’t perform as well with larger datasets.Secondly, if you’re reaching out to more than 1000 people at once with the same email template, chances are these emails won’t be customized enough to truly connect with anyone on a personal level. This will result in poor open and response rates.Sales Navigator principally works for outreach to individuals. To prospect for startups, Crunchbase Pro's database is the place to go.Here’s where we come to another crucial factor in connecting with your ICP: timing.The key here is to find companies showing recent signs of growth, such as high-level staff hires, first significant media coverage, and having their website break on the main search engines.These inflection points in a business usually generate new needs (and spending capacity) for monitoring services and other SaaS infrastructure.Crunchbase Pro enables you to look at some of the most significant triggers, notably which companies recently raised funds. Here, we’ve searched for organizations that raised Series A investment in the last 30 days.Now that you’ve found your prospects, time to shoot them some emails!But wait, LinkedIn and Crunchbase Pro don’t necessarily include external contact information. How do we overcome that?Apollo contains a detailed database for both individuals and companies. Most importantly for our purposes, it interfaces directly with LinkedIn’s URLs.This allows you to cross-reference the profiles you’ve selected through Sales Navigator with Apollo searches, pulling up the contact information for prospects listed on either database.(Note: Some email addresses are actually the software’s automated best guess, based off the name and company. This is why it’s crucial to verify this contact information—we discuss this further under “email validation” below.)Apollo’s full plan comes with an SMB level price tag; as a startup, you probably want the basic plan.This requires a bit of manual exporting; essentially, you’ll need to pull data from every page individually by clicking “add to list”. This might be a good time to get assistance off Upwork.Here’s a screenshot of Apollo’s search function. The filter system is pretty sophisticated.For smaller-scale outreach in particular, Interseller is a fantastic tool.Like Apollo, Interseller allows you to export profiles from Sales Navigator, search for contact information, and send customized emails.The chrome extension offers a “select all” feature for a variety of databases on the top right corner to begin the process.Interseller’s automator will then go on to create an email combining the data it mined automatically, with your personal touch.The proposed email should look something like this:Because it’s so customizable, Interseller is great for small-scale outreach. If you want to make the most use of its personalization capacities though, you’ll need to put in some manual effort of your own.Outboundly offers a different approach to personalization. Their software actually uses AI to generate hooks you can go through and select which ones to use.If you’re looking to do sales outbound at scale with minimal manual input, PhantomBuster is a full-service automatic growth tool that also interfaces directly with LinkedIn.Tried and true sales wisdom tells us that a single email is rarely enough to convert a prospect. A general rule of thumb is the triple contact rule—any more than that can get annoying. For a list of all the emails we send during the lifetime of a client, take a look at this article.With PhantomBuster, you can easily set up a multiple-email pattern, such as a longer introduction with two follow ups.Their phantoms also allow you to automate connection requests, follows, endorsements, and commenting on LinkedIn.(Note that LinkedIn recently changed its terms to bring its connection limits from 150/daily to around 100/weekly.)Some other automatic growth tools worth checking out are Expandi.io and LaGrowthMachine.Expandi.io allows users to plan an entire campaign from a single platform.Here you can plug in profiles from Sales Navigator, set up automated connection requests, and send out personalized messages.If you’re looking to create a campaign that leaves no stone unturned and no prospect behind, LaGrowthMachine has you covered.Offering 17 separate micro-services, there is practically no platform that this software can’t touch.For a regular audience, this cross-platform strategy might be a little overkill. For targeting high-value prospects, however, it’s well worth it.Due to the nature of databases, some of your farmed contact information will be invalid. Inevitably, a proportion of emails sent out will bounce.For emails pulled straight out of Apollo and similar databases, we’ve found that this rate lies around the 8–10% mark.According to industry standard, the bounce rate needs to remain under 2%. Above that level, you risk being flagged as spam, or even having your accounts shut down.Email validators like BriteVerify, Bouncer, Interseller, and Lemlist provide critical tools for cutting the bounce rate down to safe levels.Here’s an example from Interseller.Plug in a .CSV list of contact information, map fields manually, and the software will give you its assessment on the viability of the emails you’ve put in.Lemlist offers another highly useful tool: domain warming.It’s always a good idea to set up a new domain for outreach. This should have a name that can be recognized as part of your business but remain apart from your main operating domain.Firstly, this separates high-priority communications with current clients and team members from the lower-priority mass of outreach emails sent out on a daily basis.Secondly, if things do go wrong and your domain gets flagged as spam, you don’t risk having your actual operations domain shut down.With a separate outreach domain, you can also afford to get a little more experimental in your campaign approaches.Once you’ve set up a fresh sales outbound domain, make sure the SPF and DKIM records are set up properly.Now we’re good to start emailing! Not so hasty though—the fastest way to end up marked as a spam account is to go from 0 to 60 on Day 1.Instead, you’ll need to build up slowly. Lemlist’s “lemwarm” feature takes care of this nicely: all you need to do is set the “start” and “goal” numbers for emails and determine the time period to build up over. We recommend a minimum of 2–4 weeks to be on the safe side.If you’re looking for a magic bullet to do all your outreach for you, the bad news is that it doesn’t exist.The simple fact is that no tool can mimic your voice and passion, because no tool understands your product like you do.What these tools do offer, however, is a way to reach a larger audience more quickly, more reliably, and with less effort, so you can focus on other aspects of your business.SaaS businesses can greatly benefit from the financial insights that Baremetrics offers.

      "Creating the Ideal Customer Profile as a Startup: A Step-by-Step Guide.\n",
      "The most sure-fire way to achieve rapid growth in your business is to make sure you’re marketing to the right people.In the early stages of founding a startup, finding clients can be a bit of a shot in the dark. If you’re not sure who could benefit from your services yet, casting a wide net and targeting a broad market is one path towards identifying them.This process is quite inefficient, however, and you might find yourself spending a lot of time, effort, and development money on customers who, in the long run, will do little to help you grow.So how do you find the perfect sales target?Here’s where the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) comes in.You may have heard of the term “customer persona”, i.e., fictionalized archetypes of people most likely to use your services.An ICP is more specific: the key word here is ideal, as in, within your market corner, who are the golden goose consumers who will help you grow the fastest.Here’s a simple step-by-step guide on how to create your Ideal Customer Profile and use it effectively.Step 1: Identify ICPs within your current user base.Step 2: Interview a sample of current ICP users.Step 3: Compile the data.Step 4: Action the insights you gained in marketing and R&D. The ideal customer profile has three main characteristics:Essentially, your ICP should bring in high revenue in both the short and long term, while requiring minimal support from your team.The first step is to look through your database of existing customers to identify who possesses these traits.Start by segmenting your clients.If you want some ideas on how to do that, here’s an easy guide on how to use Baremetrics for customer segmentation. Baremetrics offers over 26 different metrics for business insights and is currently offering a free trial.Here are some examples on which metrics to segment against revenue and LTV:Looking through this data should highlight a few broad commonalities among your high revenue, high LTV, and low hassle customers, such as where they operate from, their role within their field, and how they are using your services.Consider using the Baremetrics segmentation tool to make this process easier and track the progress of the groups separately afterwards. Here's an example of segmenting customers based on:When it comes to getting honest feedback, nothing beats a phone call. Surveys will provide some basic answers, but these won’t be anywhere near as detailed or informational as a direct call.One of the most valuable pieces of information to be gained here is how people are trialing comparable services, and why or why not they settled on yours.Phone calls also provide some added opportunities. You can educate a customer on how to use your product better and encourage them to upgrade. A user about to churn could be brought back if a pain-point is addressed in the conversation.Use the insights you gained through segmentation to select about 20–30 customers to interview.Ideally, these interviews should be conducted by the founder or other high-level staff in your SaaS enterprise.When looking for a contact at a customer’s company, remember that businesspeople tend to be more receptive to picking up the phone than developers, and that decision-makers are less likely to have the time for an interview, but their feedback is usually the most valuable.Instead of focusing exclusively on high-value customers, include medium-value ones too. A large number of middle-of-the-pack users is more likely to generate actionable feedback than a small number of high-value customers using a more tailored service.If you have the opportunity, consider expanding your interview base to include churned customers, closed losts, unconverted trials, prospects, etc.While hearing the positives about your product from confirmed users is invaluable, so is gaining an understanding of why your services aren’t for some people. You might find that simple changes are enough to reconvert them to your product and render your services more attractive to undiscovered prospects like them.Don’t like these? Adapt your own!As you discover things about your users, don’t be afraid to incorporate new ideas into subsequent interviews! Hurray, you’ve completed the interviews! Now what?First off, you’ll want to transcribe the information with a service like de-script or outsourced help from Upwork.Then, you need a good system for categorizing the answers.Remember, the purpose of compiling this data is to help you understand why ICPs are choosing your product to determine where you can find high-value prospects like them.If you’ve included churned customers, closed losts, and unconverted trials, it will also spotlight areas for development if you so choose.In each transcript, highlight important points and make sure any quotes and references are linked back to this source document for context.Keep track of key points from each interview in a spreadsheet and list them against metrics such as company location, role of the person interviewed, revenue, etc. This will be helpful later on when trying to find common issues or desires from customers of a certain region or industry.Make a separate document listing real pain points to send to your developers for fixing, as well as the sales team to include, for example, in “come back” emails to churned customers.Finally, create a rubric of answers where you can easily cross-reference how many times a similar answer was given and the type of customer who voiced it.You’ll want to break that down further by subcategories, such as [your product] vs. competitors, friction points, triggers to buy, etc.And that’s it! This process will show you exactly who your ICPs are, how they are using your product, and where you can reach them.So now you know who your ICPs are, time to put the insights you’ve gained to work.This data should tell you which platforms your ICPs use, their key demographics, and what features they care most about. From there, you can build an effective marketing strategy that directs sales towards potential customers who not only will use your services, but use them in a way that benefits your business the most.It will also give you an idea of whether your price points are where they should be, if there is room to raise subscription fees, or if you should consider creating a lower-level service tier.With permission, you might even pull out quotes to create some customer testimonials on your website and for ad copy.The interviews will no doubt have highlighted some common areas of friction. Some might be easy fixes while others require complete overhauls. Something to bear in mind is that, even if an issue is raised multiple times, fixing it might not actually directly result in growth. In other words, weigh up development costs against lost revenue and potential growth when making major development decisions—as a founder, ultimately, it’s your call.Are you looking for insights on your business metrics?

      "LTV: Why You’re Measuring LTV Wrong.\n",
      "If your company only tracks one metric, the one that should top the list is LTV (Lifetime Value). You are probably already tracking many KPIs, but the one that sits at the heart of your business is LTV.LTV helps you monitor the analytics of your business in perpetuity while streamlining the customer acquisition strategy, marketing budget, and profitability.In this article, we’ll discuss the typical ways of measuring LTV, and why that might be giving you wrong results. We will cover a few other factors that should be integrated into calculating LTV and show you the best way to calculate the right LTV.The most straightforward formula for measuring LTV in a subscription business is as follows:LTV = customer lifetime ✕ gross profitwhere gross profit is calculated as Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA) ✕ gross margin and customer lifetime as 1/customer churn rate.Thus, the total calculation looks like this:LTV = ARPA ✕ gross margin/customer churn rateFor example, if we calculate LTV using the above formula with a customer churn rate of 3% per month, an ARPA of $200 per month, and a gross margin of 80%, we get a customer lifetime of 33.33 months and an LTV of $5,333.33.You can also replace the customer churn rate with revenue churn rate. This provides a second type of churn rate. We will discuss this a bit more below.For now, the formula to calculate LTV with the revenue churn rate is:LTV = gross profit/revenue churn rate. These formulas are a good start, but here are a few basics you should keep in mind when you calculate LTV using the above methods.By default, many people calculate customer lifetime value not with gross profit but with revenue. The problem is that, if you calculate customer lifetime value using revenue in the formula, the projection will be overly optimistic. Therefore, it’s essential to use gross profit.But what is gross profit? It’s the money left over after deducting all costs associated with providing your service from the revenue generated.The formula is:Company’s revenue − costs of goods sold  = gross profit.Coming to the next point, when calculating your churn rate, make sure you segregate the customers with annual plans from those with monthly plans.Thus, when you have a mix of annual and monthly subscribers, you should measure their LTV separately to get more actionable information.Some companies determine the LTV of customers that pay different amounts per month at the same time, but this might not give you the best information. Consider segmenting your customers based on how much they pay and measuring their LTV separately, so that you can make varying strategic decisions for your different service plans.Read More: How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and Increase Customer ValueThe customer churn rate tells you about the percentage of customers you lost, while the revenue churn rate, also known as MRR churn, informs you about how much your revenue is decreasing monthly.For example, if your company loses ten customers that pay $1 per month, then your customer churn is 10 and your revenue churn is $10. Now, if your company lost one customer that paid $100 per month, then your customer churn decreases to 1, but the revenue lost with that one churn is $100.So, if you do not calculate LTV with customer churn rate and revenue churn rate, then you cannot get an accurate representation of your company’s financial health. The various formulas for measuring LTV give you different information, and they should all be used.You need to know the value of your customers, i.e., the revenue or loss they are generating, which requires calculating LTV with both customer churn rate and revenue churn rate.When you need customer churn and revenue churn data, there’s no need to battle through datasheets to do the calculation. Use Baremetrics to give you accurate insight into both. It’ll make the rest of your calculations effortless and accurate.Interesting Read: Do Churn-Based LTV Calculations Mislead Us?When you have a small SaaS business, you do not have many employees and the profit margin is high, often 85–95%. So, measuring LTV with revenue is acceptable.But, as your enterprise matures and with it has larger expenses and more employees, you can no longer rely on revenue-backed LTV. To scale your business safely, you need to use gross profit instead of revenue.Imagine you spend $10, including all company costs, to acquire a single customer. Then, that customer subscribed to your service for three months at $10 per month. The calculation would look like this:LTV = 3 purchases ✕ $10 = $30.This results in your LTV being greater than your CAC (Customer Acquisition Costs).When your CAC is lower than your LTV, and your LTV is rather high, the service can be a money-making machine for your business.However, don’t calculate LTV with revenue as it overestimates the value of your customers and can have you spending far more to acquire new customers than is prudent; instead, use gross.Every CEO of a SaaS business craves negative churn. This means that your expansion revenue from existing customers is greater than the lost revenue from their churn. This expansion revenue does not include income from any new customers, just the existing ones.Sounds great, right? Well, achieving this is not as straightforward as it seems to be, although it is doable and SaaS companies actively work on achieving this goal, declaring it to be their primary focal point.LTV becomes infinite when calculating it based on the above formulas if your company has negative churn or a very long customer lifetimeHere is where the problem lies: If you have a very long customer lifetime or have achieved the milestone of negative churn when you calculate LTV, it will result infinite, which is impossible. So, the formulas break down here since they show results that are not rational.David Skok, a serial entrepreneur who has a great passion for helping entrepreneurs and startups, suggests different formulas for use with negative churn. With his experience and elaborative guide, he explains how to calculate LTV with negative churn in his article “What’s your TRUE customer lifetime value.”In the article, he suggests assuming a positive churn rate, which makes sense as the churn rate cannot be lower than zero.Here is an example of how to use his suggested formulas. If the negative churn rate of your company is 12%, then you should take it as the result of two variables:Thus, in this case, instead of calculating your LTV with a negative churn rate, use 10% for churn, while the 22% growth in existing customer sales can be factored in elsewhere when projecting your future revenue growth.In addition, he suggests that you should assume existing customers will increase their spending by a certain percentage from the original contract value over time. In this way, the lost revenue from churned customers will eventually be balanced by the expansion of the average sale from retained customers.The following steps will improve your LTV measurement process:Here is a real-time example in a Google Sheet you can follow to calculate your LTV.This sheet has examples of the LTV calculation and cohort-based projection of LTV. To calculate your own LTV, you can copy or download the sheet and replace the sample data with your own. Or, you can simply use the formula below to get your results.Instead of the original formula of LTV = ARPA ✕ (gross margin/customer churn rate), David Skok suggests an advanced procedure to calculate the LTV realistically:LTV = ARPA ✕ gross margin ✕ (1/(1 − K) + (G ✕ K)/((1 − K)2))The concepts of G and K can be explained as follows:The formula for K is given below.K = (1 − customer churn rate) ✕ (1 − discount rate)The LTV calculated using the above data and formula will be accurate and not overly optimistic. When measuring LTV, these are the essentials for an accurate calculation.Note the points mentioned above and make sure to have only the most accurate data for the best LTV approximation, and remember that LTV is always an approximation as you can only know the actual lifetime value of a customer after they have churned.\n"

      "What is Net Revenue?.\n",
      "Owning a business is easy, but running a business is not. Making money isn’t easy, but managing it is even harder. Here, we will introduce you to one of the most important financial metrics for tracking the performance of a business—net revenue.There are hundreds of tools available online to help you track this particular financial metric, and choosing the right tool has never been harder. We discuss this metric in depth, and, to make it easier to track, we recommend Baremetrics.Baremetrics will provide your business with a single dashboard for monitoring various metrics. You can see your gross revenue, MRR, net revenue, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more directly on your Baremetrics dashboard. Check out the demo account here. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now. Net revenue is the total revenue earned from the sale of your product minus returns and discounts. Some businesses also get revenue from shares, interest, or other sources. These are not included in net revenue.Net revenue is calculated based on the amount earned only from your core business. It does not take expenses into account such as licensing fees, employee salaries, and rent. This means that net revenue gives a rough estimate of how your business is doing and the market share that your business holds in your domain. It is also used to calculate your net income once you have tallied all the expenses you have incurred. Net revenue is simply your net sales number—the amount of money you have taken in after all discounts, returns, etc. have been accounted for. Although high revenue is the first step to high profitability, without understanding your expenses, you cannot jump to the conclusion that your company is financially healthy. Before we can calculate the net revenue, we need to calculate the gross revenue, which equals the sum of all sales transactions without discounts or refunds. Let’s assume you provide a SaaS service. In a particular month, your company has 1,000 subscribers at a monthly price of $200 each. So, gross revenue is $200,000. In addition, assume that it costs you $100 per customer to render your services.Of the 1,000 subscribers, 200 received an introductory discount price of $150. This is a total of $10,000 in discounts. In addition, 10 customers cancel their service in the first week for a full refund. The cost of returned services is $1,000.The mathematical formula for net revenue would look like this:In the above example, your net revenue = 200,000 – (10,000 + 1,000 + 100,000)= $89,000Net revenue can be calculated using the amount earned only from your core services. It does not take expenses into account such as licensing fees, employee salaries, and rent. This gives you a rough estimate of how your business is doing and the market share that your business holds in your domain. Gross Revenue is the overall amount that you transacted by selling your product but does not exclude the important factors of discounts and refunds. With just gross revenue, you will not have as clear an idea of how your business is doing. Net revenue is important for every aspect of the sales side of your business. It is important to track changes to revenue as you change prices, adjust your marketing strategy, etc., to see whether your decisions are having a positive effect. You should also take a particularly close look at net revenue when you are offering a new service plan to see if it is finding new customers or only cannibalizing clients signed up to other, potentially more expensive, plans. Baremetrics is a comprehensive tool that will help you visualize your net revenue. With this tool, you will even be able to prevent losses from failed payments and identify churn metrics to understand why your customers are leaving.

      "Is Deferred Revenue a Liability?.\n",
      "Yes. Yes, it is. But, if you want to know why, you might need to read a bit more of this article — this article will dive into what are liabilities, what is deferred revenue, and how you need to document these values in your accounting. If you’re in need of financial metrics for your SaaS, Baremetrics provides an easy-to-read dashboard that gives you all the key metrics for your business, including MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and easily.Simply put, a liability is something that your company owes. This can be anything from a 30-year mortgage on an office building to the bills you need to pay in the next 30 days. If you want a refresher on all the basic accounting jargon, we have you covered. We will definitely be using some of those terms here. Now, you might be wondering: If a liability is something you owe, then how can revenue be a liability? Well, to understand this, you need to appreciate what is meant by deferred.For a SaaS business founder, it is crucial to understand how deferred revenue works because dealing with subscription revenue is a crucial part of  SaaS accounting. If you go to a store and buy a computer with cash, everything happens at once for both you and the shopkeeper. In one instance, the shopkeeper receives the cash owed and has earned the revenue. Likewise, you lose the cash and receive your laptop.However, with a SaaS subscription model, often you have earned revenue you haven’t received yet or received revenue you haven’t earned yet. If you have earned revenue but haven’t received it, then you have revenue sitting in an accounts receivable journal. If you have received revenue that you haven’t earned yet, then you have generated deferred revenue.But why is deferred revenue a liability you may ask? The simple explanation is that you owe your client services, as they have paid you for services that you have not yet rendered. A liability is something you owe, and even if you owe services, it is still something owed.This isn’t a bad thing, but it does require some caution. Deferred revenue has some interesting characteristics. Let’s look at some of them.1. Deferred revenue should be treated differently from other cash.Since you haven’t provided the services yet—services for which you may incur expenses—you should treat the cash received as deferred revenue more carefully than other revenue. Although it looks the same sitting in your bank account, you should be careful not to rely on revenue that you have not yet earned. At best, this is leveraging your future profitability, while at worst you could be spending money that might end up needing to be returned if a customer cancels their subscription early. 2. Deferred revenue is good debt.Assuming that you can keep your customers happy enough to not cancel early and that you have the skills and capacity to deliver your services, then deferred revenue is an interest-free loan from your customers. 3. Deferred revenue impacts your financial statements differently.Because you have cash coming in that is not yet earned, deferred revenue will show up on your statement of cash flows but not your income statement. It also shows up as a liability on your balance sheet. This pinpoints one of the many ways your financial statements show different and complementary information. You need them all to truly appreciate your company’s financial health, and we will look at how all this works in detail below.There are two main accounting systems: cash accounting and accrual accounting. Which one you use will depend on the size of your company, its ownership profile, and any local regulatory requirements. In cash accounting, revenue and expenses are recognized when they are received and paid, respectively. That means there is no deferred revenue. Once you are paid, the revenue goes on your income statement. In accrual accounting, things are a lot more complicated. Revenue is recorded when it is earned and not when the cash is received. If you have earned revenue but a client has not yet paid their bill, then you report your earned revenue in the accounts receivable journal, which is an asset. Conversely, if you have received revenue from a client but not yet earned it, then you record the unearned revenue in the deferred revenue journal, which is a liability.Deferred revenue affects the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows differently. Deferred revenue shows up in two places on the balance sheet. First, since you have received cash from your clients, it appears as part of the cash and cash equivalents, which is an asset. However, since you have not yet earned the revenue, deferred revenue is shown as a liability to indicate that you still owe the client your services.Since most prepaid contracts are less than one year long, deferred revenue is generally a current liability. However, if you are in the enviable position of having clients paying for multiple years of service up front, then part of your deferred revenue will be considered a long-term liability. Deferred revenue does not appear on the income statement. However, each accounting period you will transfer part of the deferred revenue account into the revenue account as you fulfill your part of the contract. Then, the recognized revenue will appear on the income statement.The statement of cash flows simply shows what money is flowing into or out of the company. Since deferred revenue is cash received, it shows as a positive number in the operating activities part of the cash flow statement. It doesn’t matter that you have not earned the revenue, only that the cash has entered your company. Let’s look at how deferred revenue journal entries work. Consider the following three simple scenarios. For simplicity, in all scenarios, you charge a subscription fee of $500 per month for clients to use your SaaS product.This is the simplest case. You receive cash at the same moment that you earn the revenue. Since they overlap perfectly, you can debit the cash journal and credit the revenue journal.In this scenario, you need to use two sets of journal entries. On January 31st, you earn the revenue but do not receive the cash, so you credit the revenue account the same as in Scenario 1, but instead of cash you debit accounts receivable to show that you are still waiting on the cash. Then, on February 28th, when you receive the cash, you credit accounts receivable to decrease its value while debiting the cash account to show that you have received the cash.In this scenario, you have received cash before you have earned the associated revenue. On January 1st, to recognize the increase in your cash position, you debit your cash account $6000 while crediting your deferred revenue account to show that you owe your client the services. Then, at the end of each month, you will reduce the deferred revenue liability by crediting it $500 while debiting the revenue account on your income statement to show that you have now earned a portion of the deferred revenue.Whether you have earned revenue but not received the cash or have cash coming in that you have not yet earned, use Baremetrics to monitor your sales data.Baremetrics makes it easy to collect and visualize all of your sales data so that you always know how much cash you have on hand, which clients have paid, and who you still owe services to. When you have many clients, some are subscribed on an annual basis while others monthly, with multiple tiers and various add-ons, it can be difficult to calculate your MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), and so much more. Thankfully, there is Baremetrics to do all of this for you.Baremetrics can even monitor your SaaS quick ratio so you know immediately if your accounts receivables are getting out of control. It can even help make sure you collect on delinquent accounts. Integrating this innovative tool can make financial analysis seamless for your SaaS company, and you can start a free trial today.\n"

      "Monitoring MRR Expansion from Upgraded Subscriptions in Stripe.\n",
      "Arguably the most beautiful aspect of SaaS or subscription based businesses is the recurring revenue that comes with them. As a business owner or founder, you worry far less about how much cash is in the bank with the predictability that Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) brings.  Then comes the opportunity to expand revenue with the help of upgraded subscriptions. Upgrading or downgrading subscriptions can be as simple as effecting a price change for your current features and products. In the situation that upgrades go well, your customers get more of what they want, while revenue shoots up to the right. As my dad says, “Well that’s not hard to take.”When considering expansions and offering customers upgrades, two things need to be considered:In this article, we’re going to talk about just that: how can you best monitor expansion for customer upgrades in Stripe. Let’s go!An upgrade is simply a change to an existing subscription plan. Suppose your pricing plans and features are well-structured. In that case, these changes should be a regular occurrence that allows your company to identify patterns and determine if they will be termed recurring, adding to MRR values. Two ways a subscription can be upgraded is by changing the price or changing the quantity.In the subscription plans your SaaS company currently offers, there is most likely more than one plan for your customers to choose. SaaS subscription plans feature an average of 9 plans with varying and incremental prices. To change the price to effect an upgraded subscription, consider this example.Customer X signs up for the monthly basic plan on your website or marketplace. The basic plan costs $16; after the first month, Customer X opts for a different plan that costs $25 because it has more features or allows more functionalities with your product, or has a more extended billing period. In Stripe, a series of API codes initiate the switch from one subscription plan to another using Customer X’s retrieved ID.  If the switch is between two monthly subscriptions, the billing dates will remain the same. However, when the upgrade is made from a monthly subscription to a yearly subscription, the billing date automatically changes to the day when the upgrade was completed.Where the most common way of upgrading subscriptions in SaaS is by changing price, changing quantity is also a way to go. It isn’t unheard of that custom offers are given to clients who request them. Often, SaaS companies develop pre-set quantities for each subscription plan. However, for the proper negotiations, quantities may be moved around, and sometimes for higher price rates. Regardless, an increase or add-on of quantities can be classified as an upgrade.It’s an unfortunate part of business, but customers will need to downgrade subscriptions from time to time: rough couple of months, unforeseen financial changes, changes in product needs, etc. Similar to upgraded subscriptions, subscription plans can be downgraded by changing the price or changing the quantity.If Customer X decides after the first month of the upgraded version that costs $25, that they would prefer to go right back to the basic plan, the switch will result in a downgraded subscription. The price for Customer X’s subscription will be moved down to $16 once more.As with the sequence for upgrading subscriptions in Stripe, you’ll downgrade a subscription in Stripe using a different set of API codes. Once the downgrade is initiated, the codes will  run automatically.Let’s say Customer X decides that they don’t need particular features in the subscription plan they are currently paying while retaining some other remaining perks. To downgrade a subscription in this situation, simply change the quantity available in that subscription plan.Now you know how to manually upgrade and downgrade subscriptions in Stripe. Let’s move on and talk about how to best manage plans and features for your SaaS.Many established SaaS companies have a leg up on the early stage startups that can’t be overlooked. Companies that have been around understand well what pricing plans features work best in each package. But how’d they get there? It has all come through trial and error.For a SaaS company with only a few years under its belt, figuring out the best strategy for subscription plans takes diligence, attention, and experimentation. If this is you, here are a few things to keep in mind early on:When deciding what units, quantities, or features should go into each package, consider the best positions that will prompt your customers to get an upgrade. This strategy is tried and proven, and you can find it almost everywhere. Let’s say that you start with three subscription plans with incremental pricing; understanding that one out of the three will keep your MRR in tip-top shape can be your plus. For some SaaS companies, you’ll find that the subscription plan in the middle is often positioned to be the “one.” Your “one” preferred subscription plan should then contain features that the basic plan does not have but which a customer could use if they want to make the most out of your product. Compared with this preferred plan, the advanced (or in some cases “enterprise”) plan may contain all the same features, but include more perks that the customer can do without and still enjoy your product. Those additions in the advanced package won’t typically do much to sway their interest in the preferred plan (unless a customer’s needs are more aligned with an enterprise plan). In addition to keeping track of subscription payments and reducing churn, subscription management software can provide several more perks. For example, Baremetrics provides financial metrics that can help your company hit the ground running. Also, if you’re wanting to pull information on SaaS companies in your industry, Baremetrics Open Benchmarks offers insights into things like the Average Number of Plans that SaaS businesses operate with and more. This kind of information can be a game-changer when trying to position your subscription plans as well as (or better than) your competition. Nothing hurts an intended upgrade like a failed charge or declined payment. More often than not, payments fail due to your billing system that’s integrated with your website. Keep in mind though that there are multiple other reasons why failed payments fail. Whatever the reason, an efficient payment system, such as Stripe, is meant to work hand-in-hand with your customer service to help both your customers and team seamlessly handle upgrades.Tracking your company’s MRR as subscriptions are upgraded or downgraded is essential. Hopefully you’re still not one of the few manually making those calculations in a Google Sheet. Instead, you should be using a tool that presents all the necessary revenue metrics in an easy to access dashboard. Insert Baremetrics. 😉Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics about your business, most especially your MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. From there you can integrate directly with your payment gateways, ensuring information about your customers is automatically piped into a central, crystal-clear dashboard. Additionally, you’ll have the ability to see more clearly into Stripe Analytics when it comes to metrics like:Join the other 90% of our customers using Stripe analytics to monitor MRR increases seamlessly.

      "How to Create an Effective Go-To-Market Strategy for Your SaaS Product.\n",
      "With more than 15,000 SaaS companies operating worldwide, the global SaaS market is constantly growing as new products continue to enter the market. Whether you're a startup or an established company, launching a new SaaS product isn't as easy as it was 15 years ago. You need to have a strategic approach that includes identifying your market fit, developing appropriate positioning and marketing strategies, and measuring performance. Here's where having a go-to-market (GTM) strategy comes into the picture. It acts as a product launch blueprint for your business, enabling you to reach customers and sell your product more effectively. Here's how you can create an effective GTM strategy for your SaaS product. Leading SaaS and subscription businesses rely on Baremetrics to track the success of product launches, essential business metrics, and more. Start your free trial today.Before delving into the importance of a GTM strategy, let's discuss the types of markets. Most markets fall into the following types:In a thriving market, customers have a well-defined need, and there are a few leaders offering stable product choices. The scope for innovation is minimal, and even if it happens, it is rarely game-changing. Take the restaurant business, for example. A few selected names, such as Starbucks, McDonald's, and Domino's, have dominated the space for decades. In a new market, innovation is the key. Take the smartphone market, for instance. Every year, companies need to develop new features and specifications, or else they'll be outdone by their competitors. SaaS falls into the new market, where companies that chase product innovation can get a first-mover advantage and redefine the entire market. Back in the day, when the SaaS industry was in its early stages, product innovation was sufficient for SaaS companies. Not many products existed, and a company with a revolutionary product could easily get eyeballs and new consumers. Things have changed now. Users are more informed than ever, and product innovation alone isn't sufficient to engage customers and drive conversions. While product innovation can get you a seat at the table, you'll need a well-devised GTM strategy to introduce your product to the market, reach customers, and get sales.A GTM strategy can work wonders for SaaS businesses because it lays out a complete blueprint of launching a product, delivering it to the customer, and generating revenue from it. Let's say product innovation is your core strength. You have a highly skilled and competent team that keeps coming up with new product ideas. But what if you don't have a great marketing team that can turn your product's features into benefits and communicate them to the right audience? Or, what if you have a fantastic marketing team that generates quality leads, but your sales team isn't competent enough to convert them into high-paying customers? Perhaps you have an excellent sales team that brings in new customers, but your customer service team isn't able to deliver quality customer service, resulting in a high churn rate. For your SaaS product to succeed, you need to tick all the boxes. You need an amazing product with an effective marketing, sales, and pricing strategy supported by user-centric customer service. What makes a GTM strategy so important and unique is that it helps you put your best foot forward in all these departments, thereby escalating the chances of the product's success. Furthermore, it enables you to build financial models, measure a product's success, identify scope for improvement, and adapt to market trends.The GTM strategy is unique to each company and product; however, certain elements are common in each GTM strategy. These include:Now that you have learned about the importance of key elements of a GTM strategy, let's look at a step-by-step process of creating a GTM strategy that sets your product up for success. The primary step in any GTM strategy is to determine where your product would fit in the market. This step is also known as determining your product-market fit. No market need is one of the biggest reasons why startups fail. Consider 101 Studios, for example. 101 Studios had a great idea – they produced video games to simplify complex learning concepts for school students. The idea was to create a line of fun-to-play games that would also help players enhance their knowledge on different topics. While the concept was great, people weren't just willing to pay for an edutainment product. Therefore, it is critical to understand the need for your product before even entirely developing it. You can realize your product-market fit by answering the following questions:Once you understand your product-market fit, create your minimum viable product (MVP) prototype and give free access to potential customers. Get feedback from them to realize if your product will succeed. You can use the 40% rule to test the viability of your product. Ask your users how they would feel if they could no longer use the product? Give them four options:If more than 40% of responses are \"extremely disappointed\" and/or \"somewhat disappointed,\" you are on the right track. The next important step after verifying the demand for your product is to identify and understand your target audience. There are three levels of target markets for SaaS businesses:Don't try to attract all types of consumers, as you'll risk presenting yourself too thin. You can expand your customer base after establishing yourself as a renowned SaaS company. But if you are in the early stages, stay focused on a single target market. The next step is to establish your unique value proposition, which, simply put, means how your product can help your target audience in a way that no other product can. A customer value matrix is an effective approach to highlighting your product's value. It comprises three sections:Having a streamlined marketing, sales, and distribution plan is essential, regardless of whether you are selling to small businesses or enterprises. Here's how you can develop these strategies. Your marketing strategy should essentially include how you intend to position your brand and product in the market and which channels you want to choose. Let's briefly discuss brand positioning by comparing two prominent names in the SaaS industry: SAP Technologies and HubSpot. When you visit the SAP website, you'll notice that SAP positions itself as a highly professional and specialized industry leader in the enterprise technology space. Their positioning reflects in everything from their web design to web copy to color palette. HubSpot's website, on the other hand, gives a youthful, energetic, and approachable aura. In addition to establishing expertise in sales and marketing, HubSpot tries to position itself as a friendly and easy-going company. You also need to decide how you want people to perceive you. Do you want to be a serious and sophisticated company that people look up to for expert advice and thought leadership? Or, do you want to be someone approachable with whom people can interact and engage?There's no right or wrong approach to branding, but ensure that you maintain brand consistency across all your communications and channels. Talking about channels, most SaaS businesses rely on organic traffic for lead generation (through a free trial or email newsletter sign-ups). Content marketing has proven to be one of the most effective marketing strategies for SaaS companies. You can also take your content marketing efforts offline with QR codes. You can use a QR code generator to create a QR code and put it up on your offline marketing materials, like billboards or newspaper ads. Link the QR code to your free trial sign-up page. Users can scan the code from their smartphones to visit your website and sign up for your product. Paid advertising on search engines and social media is another helpful marketing strategy. It can help you reach a larger audience in less time. While organic SEO is highly effective, it takes time. Paid ads allow you to get on-demand traffic to your website. Finally, SaaS businesses can use referral marketing to increase sales. It involves incentivizing your users and partners for bringing in new customers. The use of referral marketing in the SaaS industry is growing, and rightly so. Referral leads have 2x higher conversion rates and shorter sales cycles. There are numerous other marketing channels and tactics you can use, such as cold emails, cold calling, direct marketing, and more. But if you're looking for a starting point, a combination of content marketing, paid advertising, and referral marketing will help you get started. Definitely check out this seven-step process for creating a SaaS marketing plan for a detailed blueprint. Before developing a sales strategy, you need to devise a pricing strategy for your product. There are several SaaS pricing models, including:Most SaaS companies use a combination of tiered and user-based pricing. Salesforce products are a great example of this pricing model. Take a look at Salesforce Sales Cloud pricing. Once you have determined your pricing strategy, it's time to develop a sales strategy. Three sales models are prevalent in the SaaS space:Your SaaS marketing funnel will play a vital role in generating leads and conversions for your product. A marketing funnel comprises three sections: Your marketing campaigns should be specific to each stage of your sales funnel. For instance, you should create how-to guides, blog posts, and explainer videos for TOFU, demonstrations and case studies for MOFU, and pricing information and testimonials for BOFU. Then, you can integrate your sales funnel with your marketing funnel by running paid ads, retargeting campaigns, or email marketing campaigns. SaaS businesses rely on recurring revenue. Achieving a high customer lifetime value (LTV) is crucial. The LTV you aim for should depend on your customer acquisition cost (CAC). The lower your CAC and the higher your LTV, the faster your business can grow. Suppose you spend $200 to acquire a customer. You'll need to earn $200 from that customer to be at break-even, and anything above that will be profits. So, if your average CAC is $200, your average LTV should be more than $200 for you to be profitable. Now, assume you have a $50/month plan, and a customer on whom you spent $200 signs up for it. You'd need to ensure that the customer stays subscribed to your product for at least four months (4 x $50 = $200), so you can recover your investment. The time for which a user uses your product is directly proportional to the LTV. Hence, SaaS businesses need to focus on retaining customers to increase LTV and profitability. 95% of new products fail, according to Harvard Business Review (HBR), and it can be due to numerous reasons. Lack of product-market fit is one of them, as discussed earlier. Inadequate pricing, poor marketing, and intense competition are some other reasons why products might fail. That doesn't mean your product has any fewer chances of succeeding. However, you need to measure the right metrics to assess the success and performance of your product launch. Here are key performance indicators (KPIs) you should use to measure the success of your product launch.  You have done the heavy lifting by developing and implementing a go-to-market strategy for your product. The final step is to evaluate your GTM strategy and optimize it to improve its performance. There are various metrics that you can track, such as pipeline coverage, sales team performance, lead conversion rates, etc. But let's keep the evaluation part as simple as it could get. You only need to track three metrics:As discussed, if your LTV is higher than your CAC, you're on the right track. An LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 is good, but since you're calculating it for a new product, anything better than 2:1 is fine. If it's below 2:1, you'll need to optimize your GTM strategy. Tracking channel-wise spending and revenue helps you identify which channels are performing the best. For example, if you are spending more than what you are earning on a channel, that channel doesn't fit your GTM strategy. Contrarily, if a channel is performing significantly better than others, you might want to scale it up. This guide must have provided you with the tools and knowledge necessary to build a GTM strategy for your product. One thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn't unnecessarily complicate your GTM strategy. A GTM strategy is nothing but planning every single element of your product launch process and evaluating it. It's that simple.

      "What Is Bootstrapping a Business?.\n",
      "When it was first coined, “bootstrapping” described the impossible task of “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps”. Now, we use bootstrapping to describe the not quite impossible task of building your business without financing. If you choose not to finance your business by selling part of it to venture capitalists, and you also do not want or cannot secure a loan, then you are left with bootstrapping. When bootstrapping a business, you are using your personal assets—cash, of course, but also your garage, home office, personal car, laptop, and anything else you can extract value from—to build and expand your business.When you are bootstrapping your company, you need to keep a keen eye on your cash flow. If you’re looking for a smart way to approach your SaaS business’s cash flow, with great prices for people who are bootstrapping their business, get in touch or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial today. When bootstrapping your SaaS business, you will typically progress through three main stages: the beginning stage, the customer-funded stage, and the credit stage.Beginning Stage: At the start, you’ll either not have any revenue or far less revenue than is sustainable. You might need to maintain a full-time job and treat your enterprise as a side hustle. You will be funding your dream using personal savings.Customer-Funded Stage:  At some point, your revenue stream will get to the point where customers can finally fund the day-to-day operations of the business. When revenue begins to exceed your operating expenses, you can invest in growth and will begin to see a stark increase in revenue. Credit Stage: Part of bootstrapping a company is knowing when you can no longer do it alone. For some people, this might mean raising capital from venture capitalists, while for others it is using their financial statements to secure loans from banks to finance massive growth. Bootstrapping can provide many advantages, but it also has its shortcomings.

      "Cash Accounting.\n",
      "In its simplest form, cash accounting is a system in which a company records expenses and revenues as the money changes hands. When your client hands you cash, it is reported in your books. Likewise, when you pay a vendor, the expense is realized. Note that cash accounting has many names, so you may have heard it called cash-basis accounting, the cash method of accounting, or the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, among others.If you remember our discussion of Bookkeeping for your SaaS Business, accounting is split into two categories: the cash accounting we discuss here and the more complicated, but also more accurate, accrual accounting. Unlike cash accounting, accrual accounting recognizes revenues and expenses as they are posted using accounts receivable and accounts payable journal entries.The table below gives you a quick and easy reference for the differences:There are many benefits to cash accounting, most of which are especially true for new and/or small businesses: \n",
      "Understanding Subscription Revenue.\n",
      "According to many tax authorities, SaaS companies must use the accrual accounting system, which stipulates that you record revenue when it is earned. In the case of a subscription revenue stream, this means when you have fulfilled your part of the service agreement.Consider the following two (very unrealistic) subscription revenue examples to make this point clear. 1. Your company has only really great clients who all pay for their annual subscription on January 1st. These invoices total $600,000. As much as we’d all love to take 364 days off and call that a job well done, you haven’t actually done anything yet!U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) standards stipulate that instead you should move $50,000 at the end of each month into your revenue account and keep the unearned subscription revenue in a deferred revenue account as you have not yet earned the money.2. Your company has a mix of good and not so good clients that either pay their invoices monthly or don’t seem to pay them on time for various reasons. In this case, you might be earning $50,000 at the end of each month, but you may not be receiving all of it until some days, weeks, or months late—or, unfortunately, sometimes not at all. In the first case, you have more cash on hand than your company has actually earned. In the second case, you have less cash on hand than you have earned, and you might not even receive all the money you have earned. Both situations can give you an unrealistic view of your company.It’s important to know who has given you money, and from what type of plan you have received this money. Using Baremetrics, you can measure exactly where your MRR has come from, and plan your accounting accordingly.Want to get a head start? Connect Baremetrics to your revenue sources, and start seeing all of your revenue in a crystal-clear dashboard. You can even see your customer segmentation, deeper insights about who your customers are, forecast into the future, and use automated tools to recover failed payments.There are several pricing models that can be used for your subscription revenue service. Once you have settled on a pricing model, it is time to price your model. Aside from the very technical aspects of calculating what it costs to offer your service, including the constant upgrading of what you provide, the cost of acquiring new clients, and the value add you give to your clients, there are some broad concerns to consider. Although almost any product or service can be turned into a subscription revenue model, when your SaaS company seamlessly meshes with a subscription model, the advantages are substantial. Unlike a traditional business model, where you sell to a customer and move on, a subscription revenue model gives you recurring payments from the same customer. This can allow you to offer a lower upfront price to clients, while setting up your business to receive a stable and consistent cash stream.Every time you onboard a customer, you need to create an invoice, get their payment information, and provide some immediate customer service. For a traditional business, this happens for each payment, whereas a subscription revenue model only deals with this once per customer. That frees up your effort to work on expanding your services suite or finding new clients.Similarly, for a traditional company to double their sales monthly, they’d need to find 1, then 2, then 8 (or more!) customers each month. Since a subscription revenue model maintains long, mutually beneficial relationships with customers, to dramatically improve revenue a sales team only needs to find marginally more new customers each month.Also check out: Subscription Dunning: How to Improve Revenue RecoverySince your SaaS company can maintain long relationships with clients, you can see what products they are using, and listen to what they are looking for. This gives you the opportunity to tailor your offering to the benefit of the client. This makes it easier to retain clients, better position yourself in the market for new clients, and even upsell your existing clients with new add-on features. Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.There are many, many ways to calculate your subscription revenue—and each of those ways has many, many alternative calculations that could be better for you. Let’s look at a couple of the main ones.1. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): This is the most common way to calculate subscription revenue. This metric is ideal for customers with long standing contracts that either pay up front for a contract lasting over 12 months or pay monthly with a contract in place that will last at least one year.Let’s consider these subscription revenue model examples:Although ARR can be a useful metric, if your customers pay by usage, often purchase new add-ons, or otherwise have flexibility to increase or decrease their payments each month, then calculating the ARR is difficult.2. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): This metric is similar to ARR but calculates how much your customers are paying in revenue each month. The formula is essentially the same as ARR, only the time period is one month instead of one year.Let’s look at the same two subscription revenue examples from above.1. Instead of dividing by two for the length of the contract in years, you divide by 24 for the length of the contract in months: $12,000/24 = $500.2. In this case, just stop after the first step: 20 × $1000 = $20,000.The benefit of calculating MRR versus ARR is that you can adapt it as your customers cycle through different plan tiers or add/drop some add-on features.When deciding which metrics to track, consider going through the different versions of each metric. For example, MRR also comes in a net MRR version which might be better suited to your needs.  3. Lifetime Value (LTV): Getting customers to sign up for your service is difficult—and expensive too! LTV is an absolutely crucial metric to follow so that you know how much you can spend on customer acquisition. LTV is simply how much your customers will spend on your service during the lifetime of their contract.In addition to the above information, to calculate LTV, you need to know how long your customers use your service before severing their service agreement.Let’s look at the above examples and consider an average lifetime of 10 years.Since LTV requires some estimation about churn, it can be misleading.Take a look at our article dedicated to LTV to gain more insight into how best to use this crucial metric.\n"

      "Cash Flow Statements for SaaS: Examples and Solutions.\n",
      "Cash flow is the money moving in and out of your business. It’s different from a lot of other accounting principles as it’s completely separate from your company’s profitability or value. The cash flow statement illustrates your company’s cash flow for a specific period.Operating activities are generally understood as the normal, day-to-day operations of a business. If you sell cupcakes, operating activities will include selling cupcakes or buying the sugar and flour to bake your cupcakes.In this way, cash flow from operating activities includes all the money coming into and leaving your business due to these normal, day-to-day processes. The following are some examples of cash flows from operating activities:When you hear the term “investing activities,” you probably first think about stocks. Cash flow from investing activities definitely includes the sale or purchase of stocks, but that’s not all. While the investing activities of individuals are often limited to stocks, those of businesses are more diversified.You might also buy intangible assets, which are things you cannot touch, such as new software that improves your platform or a patent. Here are some examples of cash flows from investing activities:Financing activities are how a company is funded. This includes equity and liability financing. For example, a company can use a bank loan to finance operations, or the owners can invest more of their personal savings into the business.Some examples of cash flow from financing activities are as follows:In the direct method, you need to record all the cash as it enters and leaves your business. This is a huge added bookkeeping burden because you need to keep two separate general ledgers: one for all of the activities and another just tracking the cash transactions.Not only is this method more time-consuming than the indirect method, but you will still need to do some of the indirect methods. Reconciling the cash flow statement to the income statement must still be done following the indirect method.The indirect method starts with the cash from operating activities. The net income (or loss) is taken from the income statement. Then, the accountant works backward by removing all of the non-cash revenue and expenses and adding in all of the revenue that has not been recognized and expenses that have not yet been incurred.The cash flows from investing and financing activities are straightforward in the indirect and direct methods. Since they are cash transactions, there’s no special accounting magic to be performed.The cash flow statement is intrinsically related to the balance sheet and income statement. In fact, if you have your balance sheet and income statement in front of you, then you have all the information required to draft your cash flow statement.However, there are some key differences, and they relate to each other in special ways.The balance sheet is a snapshot of the book value of a business for a specific date in time. It shows all of the assets on one side and all of the liabilities and equity on the other.The cash flow statement shows how cash has flowed over a period of time. Since the balance sheet shows things on a day instead of over a period, it’s easier to draft an accurate cash flow statement with the balance sheet from the start of the period as well as the one from the end of the period in front of you.For example, if you’re drafting a cash flow statement for the year 2021, then you should have your December 31st, 2020, and December 31st, 2021 balance sheets at the ready.The differences in owner’s equity and liabilities, as well as those for depreciation and amortization, if applicable, will directly affect your cash flow statement. We’ll see this a bit more clearly when we look at the Amazon example.The income statement and cash flow statement reveal information about the company for a period of time. The income statement presents all of the revenue and expenses over a period of time, as well as the final net income (or loss).Revenue recognition rules (primarily ASC 606) mean that sometimes the money is in your account before you have earned it or you’ve earned the revenue but not yet received the payment. The same can be said about when you pay for expenses versus when they are incurred.That means that the cash flow from operating activities are similar to the revenue and expenses found on the income statement but not the same.An income statement provides a breakdown of all the funds that have entered and left your business. This discrepancy is one of the hardest parts of drafting accurate and audit-proof cash flow statements.Take a look at the example below: Amazon’s 2016 statement of cash flow. There’s a lot of information that can be gleaned from this cash flow statement.First, the top of every financial document should show four things:A consolidated statement is simply one that has multiple periods on it. In this case, Amazon wants to show how their cash flow has changed over a three-year period.As mentioned above, there are things on the income statement that need to be adjusted for the cash flow statement. We call this “reconciling” the two documents.The first is removing/adding any revenue and expenses to match the cash flows mentioned above. The trickier one is dealing with depreciation and amortization. These are the ways that assets are turned into expenses.Let’s say you buy a laptop for $2,000 that you expect to last five years. Tax authorities allow you to claim a depreciation expense of ($2,000/5) $400 per year. However, this isn’t a cash expense.Note: This is a simplified linear depreciation example. Depending on the asset class and your location, you may be required to calculate depreciation differently. Please consult your accountant. The cash flow occurred as an investing activity because you bought an asset. The yearly depreciation is just a tax-reduction system, and no money is changing hands. That means all depreciation needs to be added back from the income statement.The same is true for amortization; only the assets are intangible, such as relationships, contracts, or patents.The red lines highlight the next cash flows from operating, investing, and financial activities. At the bottom, we can see that Amazon’s cash position has steadily climbed over this period from around $9 billion at the end of 2013 to $19 billion at the end of 2016.One final thing to mention is that negative numbers are shown in brackets. This is a standard accounting practice. If they were in red, then a black and white photocopy would be very confusing.Likewise, degraded copies can sometimes get random marks on them that might look like minus signs.Here’s an example of a typical SaaS cash flow statement. The first difference you can see is that the numbers are much smaller, in the thousands. Next, this cash flow statement is for a single year.As is typical for single year statements, subtotals are found in a middle column and totals in the right column, while individual numbers are in the left column. This improves the readability of the document.As is common for startups, this one is pretty lean. There aren’t many large equipment purchases and the values of financing activities—equity and loans—are rather small. Conversely, there is substantial cash flow in from customers and out from typical expenses. This includes labor, hosting services, and so on.Overall, the company is cash flow positive and is at little risk of unexpected expenses crushing their profitability.ABC CorporationCash Flow StatementYear Ended December 31st, 2021 (in 000s)Cash Flow from operating activitiesCash received from customers$90Cash paid to suppliers, staff, and employees($40)Cash generated from operating activities$50Interest paid($4)Taxes($18)Net cash flow from operating activities$28Cash Flow from investing activitiesEquipment purchases($5)Equipment replacement($3)Proceeds from equipment sales$1Net cash flow from investing activities($7)Cash Flow from financing activitiesProceeds from capital contributed$3Proceeds from loans$2Loan payments($7)Net cash flow from financing activities($2)Net increase/decrease in cash18Cash at beginning of the period$25Total cash at end of period$33Related: What is Net Cash Flow?A cash flow statement helps you determine your enterprise’s overall strength, profitability, and long-term viability.It helps you gauge your level of liquidity, or, in other words, whether you have sufficient cash to pay your expenses. Shareholders and investors look closely at a company’s cash flow statements and use them to determine the organization’s overall financial health.Good cash flow planning is invaluable for any company, and subscription-based businesses are no exception. Here are a few specific benefits for your SaaS business:There are several persistent cash flow-related problems that most SaaS business owners face from time to time. Let’s look at some of them.Depending on your business model, your customers’ credit terms may extend to 30 or 60 days. All too often, however, you’ll have bills that need to be paid immediately or within a few weeks, which can upset your cash flow. For this reason, it’s a good idea to set up an upfront payment structure for customers wherever possible.This problem can arise when your accounts receivable terms are more generous than those of your accounts payable. Accounts receivable are recognized revenue from customers who haven’t paid you yet. Accounts payable are incurred expenses that you haven’t paid yet.If your customers tend to pay months after they’ve used your services, consider negotiating better terms with your suppliers to match your cash flows in and out.Accounts receivable can easily get out of hand if you aren’t strictly watching out for late payments. In fact, most companies consider payments 30 days late 25% uncollectible, which then rises over time to 100% uncollectible at 120 days late.That’s why it’s sensible to set up an automated billing mechanism to ensure your customers pay you on time. Automating reminders to customers to alert them of the upcoming billing cycle is also helpful in reducing the chance of payments failing.If customers’ payments don’t go through (due to expired credit cards, insufficient funds, or other issues), you can put a dunning system in place to remind customers to update their payment information.As SaaS businesses are inherently subscription-based, when a customer stops using your software or doesn’t renew their subscription, it’s going to negatively impact your cash flow and liquidity. You should be as proactive as possible about reducing customer churn.One way to reduce customer churn is to maintain a dialog with your customers that helps you understand the features they want and then develop them.Look to advanced SaaS analytics solutions like Baremetrics to understand which customers you’re losing and why, and then move quickly to take countermeasures. The higher your customer retention rate, the better your longer-term cash flow will be.Burn rate measures how quickly your company is losing money. It can be expressed as a percentage of the total cash you have on hand or as the number of months of cash you have left.Especially getting from the pre-revenue phase through to “ramen profitability” can be difficult. One of the best ways to stretch your cash flows during this time is to use subscription services yourself. That way you turn larger upfront costs, from expensive software to servers, into manageable monthly expenses.Did you know that Flightpath by Baremetrics can generate your cash flow statements automatically? This removes tedious and difficult accounting tasks, including reconciling your cash flow statement to the income statement.If you’re looking for profit and loss, cash flow, balance sheets, and business metrics all in the same tool, look no further.

      "How to use Benchmarks by Baremetrics.\n",
      "How are you doing compared to other SaaS companies? Are your metrics where they should be? Are you on the right track?We built the Baremetrics Benchmarks feature to answer these questions.We collected data from 800+ small and medium sized subscription companies using Baremetrics, anonymized it, and aggregated it to provide benchmark data for key metrics and subscription pricing. This article will explain how to use Benchmarks to understand how your startup stacks up to similar companies, and where you can improve. Growing SaaS and subscription businesses rely on Baremetrics for better benchmarking and subscription analytics. Start your free trial today.All of our benchmark data comes from Baremetrics, of course! Baremetrics is used by hundreds of subscription companies to monitor the health of their business and improve key metrics.  To create our Benchmarks, we completely anonymize and aggregate all our customer data into one large data set. This allows you to see how your company stacks up against other companies with similar Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) values. We segment based on ARPU because it indicates how much a business charges per customer. Benchmarks includes benchmark data for: Like the entire Baremetrics toolkit, Benchmarks was designed to make understanding your data information as simple and intuitive as possible. Let’s quickly walk through what you need to know. To start, let’s look at the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) benchmark. You’ll see MRR values for the lower, median, and upper quartiles, as well as how your company stacks up. The value of Benchmarks is to not only compare your company’s metrics with others, but how you can improve, as well. To help you get started, each benchmark will provide tips for improvement. For example, if you can see that your churn is high compared to others, start with reducing churn. Growing MRR is near impossible if any new revenue you add is lost to churn.There are two main components of Pricing Insights: Statistics and Breakdown. If you’re wondering if your subscription pricing is right, or thinking about changing your pricing, this is a great place to start. Under Statistics, you’ll see four figures. These figures pertain to the Baremetrics data set, as in, 30% of Baremetrics customers with $100 ARPU offer a free plan. From a quick glance, we can see a few things:Knowing how you stack up to other companies helps you set goals and know where you need to improve in order to reach them.

      "Customer feedback: What you need to get from your customers.\n",
      "Whether you’re a startup or an established brand, getting in touch with your customers is critical. Customer feedback helps businesses identify problems and opportunities that they might overlook otherwise.Baremetrics is a great tool for automating the process of gathering customer feedback. With Baremetrics, you can automatically prompt customers with a form asking for feedback whenever a customer cancels. Then, this information is processed via the Baremetrics Cancellation Insights tool. Try out cancellation insights with a Baremetrics free trial! Get on the app, see how it works, and start getting information about your customers today.Customer feedback is information that helps business owners and managers understand what their customers think of them. Customer feedback includes opinions, insights into how your customers use your product, issues your customers have had with the UI, or any other input shared by your users about their experiences with your product.It is much more than just verbal or written communication; customer feedback can take the form of ratings, reviews, and shares on social media platforms, as well as coverage in blogs or publications.While there are so many ways of getting feedback from your customers, your focus needs to be on getting constructive criticism so you can really deliver a product that serves your customer’s needs.It is essential to know what drives customer satisfaction if you want them to be happy. Unless you understand the factors that lead to your customers being satisfied with your service, it’ll be impossible to create loyalty with them. Customer feedback is the best way to identify any inefficiencies within your user experience. The customer, being at the receiving end of the experience you provide, knows what they like and don’t like about your product. When customers are asked for opinions, they feel more involved and important. They also feel attached and a part of the product development. Getting your customers involved helps you develop your platform for them. A recent survey found that just 1 out of 26 unhappy customers is likely to complain about a service. The other 25 simply seek services elsewhere.Thus, it is vital to reach out to customers and hear about their problems, because they won’t tell you otherwise.There are multiple help desk solutions like an email ticketing system that can help you handle customer complaints and collect feedback efficiently.Get customer feedback before churn happens and be sure to avoid the top customer retention rate mistakes that companies are making today. Word-of-mouth marketing is one of the most effective strategies for any business. If you do a great job of collecting customer feedback, it will help you in brand advocacy. By proactively reaching out, listening to your customer’s problems, and then fixing the issues, great reviews are assured.When potential customers see these positive reviews, they’re more likely to buy from your company and continue spreading the word about how great it is. Your customer feedback service acts as its own customer success marketing team. Customer feedback can help you drive your business by improving the relationships you have with your customers.How do you know what customers really want? This can be inferred by the information you collect from their feedback. Here’s what information you should gather through your customer feedback form.You want to know exactly what attracts or repels a customer to your product. This is an excellent way to identify the selling points as well as the weaker points of your product.This question should be open-ended because it’s hard to guess what your customers need. There might be a simple feature you are overlooking that could revolutionize the user experience and increase sales. Providing an opportunity for customers to tell you their needs helps both solve day-to-day problems and improve the business model.This is one way to figure out if your customers are looking for something that you don’t offer. When you see a pattern in the feedback form, consider creating a poll with multiple options that ask people what features they most want.Find out exactly why your customers are choosing you vs. competitors. These reasons could be anything from price to customer service quality.Why are your customers no longer willing to pay for your services? You need to dig deep to determine the cause of cancellations to improve your products and services. An innovative way to figure this out is by using Baremetrics.The cancellation insights feature will help you track down the reasons your customers are canceling and how much revenue has been lost for specific reasons. Beyond gathering customer feedback, it can also generate automated emails to help get the customers back. When a customer attempts to cancel a subscription, they are directed to the form where they may select their reasons for cancelling. Then, personalized emails tailored to their cancellation reasons are sent to the customers.You can edit, add, or remove the cancellation reasons on your forms at any time. Customers can also share additional feedback on the last page of this process.At the end of the feedback form, leave a space for the customers to talk about their experience. You may not be able to ask all of the right questions, so give your customers the space to tell you what they really think.You might think that qualitative customer feedback is enough to achieve better outcomes, and it is massively important, but it is also valuable to take a data-driven approach and look at exactly how your customers are moving through your app. With Baremetrics you can segment your customers based on any kind of characteristic you choose. For example, you could look at what features customers are using by plan size.If only customers who are on large plans are using a specific feature, it might mean that feature is only useful for larger companies. This is the kind of feedback or insight that you need to design your service bundles and price them. In Baremetrics, you can develop custom attributes within your app, and then Baremetrics can keep track of how often those events occur. For example, specific button clicks, feature usage, or spending within the app can all be tracked with Baremetrics.You can use Baremetrics to keep track of this behavior and analyze it against the customer’s plan type, the age of the subscription, and more.With the Trial Insights feature on Baremetrics, you can monitor your customers’ behavior during their trial period. This will give you a ton of information on how your customers are responding to your free trial experience. In addition, it provides you with up-to-the-minute data on the conversion rate, average trial length, and the number of active trials.Asking customers about the barriers to purchase or what motivated them to buy can help improve your sales process. The best way to do this is to ask your customers directly in the sales call. This can be very challenging to implement operationally as you’ll need to train your salespeople, but it is very rewarding!One method of measuring customer satisfaction is the net promoter score, a customer loyalty metric that measures how likely your customers are to stick around. It’s based on a 10-point rating scale, with 0 being the lowest score possible and 10 representing highest level of satisfaction.Find out how Baremetrics increased customer loyalty by 125% in six hours. The more you hear from customers, the better equipped you are to improve their experience with your company. Customer feedback will help you:The churn rate measures the number of customers or subscribers that have stopped using your services during a given period of time. Customer feedback helps you reduce churn since it helps figure out why customers are canceling and what you can do to improve.Customer feedback helps you improve on areas that are lacking and identify potential new opportunities to offer better services.Customer feedback aims to keep your current customers happy and find out whether you can do anything to win back former customers.

      "Any online firm or business must deal with a large volume of complex data. Managing this data manually, however, results in erroneous results, aggravation, and a loss of productive time.Thanks to the many business intelligence solutions available, you may delegate these difficult jobs to them and receive accurate information to help you make the best decisions possible. One of these tools is Baremetrics.You can sign up for a free Baremetrics trial to start tracking your earnings in real-time.In general conversation, the terms revenue and income are interchangeable. However, net revenue and operating income are two separate items on your financial statements. The money you made from selling goods or services for the month, quarter, or year is referred to as net revenue or net sales. After subtracting expenses from net revenue, operating income is the amount remaining.Net revenue and operating income are two different things, and the gap between them indicates how much your revenue stream is depleted by expenses.One of the most essential lines on the income statement is operating income. It displays how much money you made from your normal company activity during the reporting period. It’s distinguished from other types of income, such as investment earnings, on the income statement.Anyone looking at your income statement will be able to tell how much money your business generates and whether it is profitable. Not only for you but also for investors and lenders, this information is crucial. Combining investment revenue with operations income would distort the company’s image.The importance of net revenue is mostly in connection to other items on the income statement. When net sales are much lower than gross sales, for example, the product may be defective, resulting in a high number of returns, or the company’s return policy may be too lenient.The difference between net revenue and operating income indicates how much your revenue stream is depleted by expenses; it may be time to cut the budget if net sales are high but operating income is low.

      "Best Invoicing Procedures: How to Handle Invoices for Small Businesses.\n",
      "Although invoicing and billing are processes where a seller issues sales documents to a buyer when compared against each other, the significant difference between the two processes is quite plain and simple.This article will explain both invoicing and billing in-depth, as well as share best practices for invoicing for small businesses.Small businesses rely on Baremetrics for smarter SaaS and subscription analytics. Start your free trial today.Invoicing is a process where a seller issues a commercial document to a buyer requesting payment. This document shows all products and services rendered, the payment owed, and the contact details of both the buyer and the seller.An invoice serves as a request for payment for specified payment terms and is typically issued after delivering the purchased service or product. An invoice also represents credit because the seller will only receive cash at a future date.On the other hand, a bill is a sales document that details a customer’s payment for purchasing products or services rendered. It’s usually written to serve as a piece of legal evidence that a transaction took place between the buyer and the seller.A bill is typically used at businesses where the customer pays for the product or service upfront, including restaurants, subscription businesses, and retail outlets.Billing on the other hand, is the process of issuing a sales document that’s used as legal proof of transaction and is usually done for one-time upfront payments. In contrast, invoicing is issuing a sales document that serves as a request for payment for products or services sold on credit. Invoicing can be done for both recurring and one-time payments.If you’re still using spreadsheets and basic dashboards to monitor and manage your cash flow, you’re not only operating inefficiently, but you’re also probably leaving money on the table.Baremetrics’ advanced analytics and reporting tools offer an affordable, fast, and flexible means to ensure you stay on top of and optimize your SaaS business’s cash flow.Our platform does all the heavy lifting for you, intelligently “automating away” meaningless numbers to uncover the true, bigger picture. A crystal-clear dashboard gives you a holistic view of your expenses, profit, and forecasted cash flow for specific timeframes. All this allows you to quickly spot inconsistencies, eliminate unnecessary waste, and more accurately model your SaaS business’s future based on multiple scenarios.Invoicing can be stressful; creating the invoice, sending it out, and following up on it can take a lot of time. Even more stressful are the recurring invoices that eventually cost you money down the line.A multitude of invoice software can help you send out invoices and manage the process efficiently. Invoicing software can save you a lot of time and money. With all your payments being managed by one software package, you’ll never lose a payment.If you’re considering invoicing software, here are a few of the best packages for your business.Wave is cloud-based invoicing software that suits small businesses. With Wave, small businesses can create, customize, send, and track invoices in one place.Wave’s other unique features are automated scheduling, automated payment reminders, and many helpful software integrations.

QuickBooks works on various digital platforms, lets you sync across your devices, and automatically stores your data in the cloud.Invoicing software is only the start. Take a look at the best financial forecasting software available on the market today.When it comes to business payment systems, invoicing is quite different for SaaS recurring subscriptions. Invoicing is a request for payment issued after a seller has delivered a product on credit, and the payment is to be settled at a future date.For SaaS subscriptions, the client agrees to an electronic contract subscription, whether the client is a business or an individual. Subscriptions are charged on a recurring interval such as monthly or yearly and clients can cancel anytime without a penalty or fee. If a customer cancels before the end of their prepaid subscription, they are typically refunded.Sending invoices to your customers is sometimes a delicate subject for business owners. When deciding the appropriate time to send an invoice, you may decide to send it right after a job, but that may be inconvenient if you are preoccupied with multiple jobs.If you decide to wait, you run the risk of disturbing your cash flow. Some other businesses adopt invoicing before the job, and that approach has its perks, but what happens if the scope of the job expands?Businesses usually send invoices in one of two ways:1. Before the work is started: There are some situations where it makes sense to invoice a client. It’s usually called prepayment or requesting a deposit. Here are some typical scenarios where you should invoice a client before the job is complete.Many businesses favor monthly subscription models because it’s profitable and offers long-term revenue growth. While considering these benefits, also consider if it’s the best option for your company and customers.Monthly subscriptions work well for service businesses that customers frequently use, and the service is frequently updated, e.g. Netflix and HubSpot. A monthly subscription also works well for businesses that sell consumables or licensed products that can be used for a limited time, e.g. subscription boxes.Innovation is critical for subscription businesses to ensure customer loyalty and their continued patronage. If the service never improves, usage will go down, and the fantastic revenues will plummet.The customer lifetime value is a metric that predicts how much a customer will spend on your product throughout their entire relationship with your business. It improves with every subscription renewal and opens up more opportunities for upselling on other services.Baremetrics is a business metrics monitoring tool that acts as a dashboard for your business.

Although some businesses adopt steps to reduce the time constraints around invoicing, some unavoidable setbacks, such as legal and regulatory requirements, must be considered while creating the layout of an invoice.Sending an invoice in multiple formats and ensuring that the layout stays the same within many platforms is stressful. When clients don’t settle invoices, your cash flow can be seriously damaged. The process of getting a client to settle their debt may leave your business repeatedly sending email reminders.In monthly subscriptions, clients are already hooked into the service and enjoying the value it adds. After the initial customer acquisition where the client usually has had the chance to try out the service, once the client opts in for the service, they’ll need to renew their subscription to continue using the service.As long as your business constantly innovates and offers new features based on customer feedback, clients will remain hooked on the service and enjoy auto-renewal benefits.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Both invoicing and monthly subscriptions drive revenue for the businesses that adopt them. There’s incredible revenue potential for companies that adopt either invoicing or monthly subscriptions. Success will depend on how management runs the business.A monthly subscription business usually delivers digital service and locks in clients for the long term. There are many opportunities to upsell and cross-sell other products and services on top of the monthly subscription.After the initial trial phase and customers register for a service, they are usually set on an auto-renew contract. In invoicing, businesses render services on credit, and businesses run the risk of customers’ debts running into the thousands, even when there are automated reminders for clients. Invoicing suffers many legal and regulatory requirements that may delay payments, whereas a monthly subscription does not.Invoicing can be avoided if your business sells conference registrations, licenses, dues, or payments to government agencies. However, if your business sells goods or services, invoicing is unavoidable. invoicing is a means of creating a legally enforceable agreement that documents the services rendered to a client and the terms of payment owed.If the transaction is between two businesses, the seller is required by law to provide an invoice. An invoice is not the same as a receipt: the former creates a sales agreement, while the latter is for acknowledgment of payment.Invoicing is always necessary if your business incurs debt in the course of selling to customers. A signed invoice will serve as a legally binding agreement that the client has agreed to pay for a product or a service. The invoice also provides details of the work being done and the timeline of completion of the work.Efficiently dealing with invoices can be an essential ingredient to the success of your SaaS business. An efficient invoicing system not only ensures that the money keeps coming in but also helps you track sales and keep accurate records for tax filings and future sales forecasting. How can you effectively handle invoicing for your SaaS company? Here are 8 steps you can adopt.Keep all information easily visible so that, when the customer takes a glimpse at the document, they can simply navigate the payment process. Remove jargon and unnecessary information; this is a sure way to help the client make fast payments.2. Ensure it’s legible and embodies your brand identity.An invoice from your company isn’t just a typical document—it’s representative of your brand. As such, your brand identity and values must be aligned with every word and formatting of the document. Leverage any chance to remind your customer of what’s great about your brand.3. Put the right date and reference number.With all the back and forth of multiple invoices, how do you keep track of the customer? Use dates and reference numbers to organize and communicate your invoices with your customer and your internal ordering.4. Ensure that the invoice has the correct terms of payment, payment amount, and due date.Another big step in keeping things clear for the customer is to include the terms of service, due date, and total amount. This practice ensures that everyone is on the same page.5. Clarify each item on the invoice.Clarity for your customer is a vital part of the transaction—a chance to explain the value you provided to the client while showing transparency in your invoicing process.Remember to keep it simple still; don’t send a massive list of items. Keep it short and straightforward. If the client has more questions, they’ll surely reach out to you.6. Address the invoice to the right person.It’s not enough to simply include the name of the company in the address. You should also attach the name of the person who supervised the work. Whether it’s a small company or a large one, doing this adds a friendly touch.7. Use emails to send invoices and activate “read receipts.”Send the invoice to your customer’s email since it’s one of the most stable and direct communication methods available. Use “read receipts” to confirm that your invoices are reaching your client’s inbox. Many invoicing tools offer “read receipts” and link tracking. This works to keep you informed on how your client has interacted with your email.Check out these great tips on how to get the most out of your Stripe or PayPal data.8. Automate recurring invoicing tasksMany accounting tools simplify the invoicing procedures by helping you automatically carry out some essential tasks. Professional services would greatly benefit from this.Some invoicing tasks can sap the company’s budget without adding any extra benefit. Use a full suite accounting software to automate manual work, save time, and reduce the chances of human error.Take some time to understand the tenets of your invoicing since you know it’s the last direct communication you have with your client. Finetune your tone of voice and use an elegant design. There’s more benefit in catering properly to current and old clients—they are easier to impress than prospective new clients.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services.

      "Customer Attrition: How to Measure It and Prevent It.\n",
      "Customer attrition is the term used to describe the loss of paying customers from a business. Customer attrition is also called customer churn and is often considered a natural part of business evolution.A customer could stop using your service for one or more reasons, whether it’s a one-time customer or a loyal customer. The big question is this: Did the customer stop voluntarily or involuntarily?The answer to this question is precisely why businesses pay close attention to their customer attrition rate.The customer attrition rate measures the rate at which customers stop patronizing a business entity over a given time. The customer attrition rate is also called the churn rate and is calculated in percentages. A company must ensure that its number of new subscribers is higher than its attrition rate, or else the business will lose revenues and profit. A higher attrition rate will eventually lead to the failure of a business. There are several ways to measure attrition, and the process differs depending on the type of business. Typically, customer attrition is calculated with the formula: There will always be customers who leave, no matter how much you try to stop them. For this reason, most businesses focus on acquiring new customers while making significant investments to understand the different causes of customer attrition.Here are a few of the tools used to measure customer attrition.This tool is available as a stand-alone service and as part of the IBM studio offer. IBM SPSS Modeler uses artificial intelligence to predict customer churn. The tool provides an interactive environment to quickly build machine learning pipelines without the need to write code.It supports many data sources and typically uses the customer churn dataset to build, test, and evaluate machine learning models that predict if a customer will stop their subscription. The tool also provides useful insights as to how businesses can address the issues leading to customer attrition and strategies to reduce churn rates. This tool is a business intelligence platform that can be used to predict customer churn. The platform has an interactive results grid that visually lets users zoom into the health and distribution datasets.The tool is a convergence of data science, analytics, and process automation. With such technology, unseen outliers are now a thing of the past, and, coupled with its powerful automation engine, companies can deploy strategic solutions to prevent customer attrition.  Trifacta is useful for cleaning and unifying messy and complex customer behavior datasets for easy access and analysis. With Trifacta, companies can focus on the quantitative analysis of the numbers of clicks, purchases, sign-ups, etc.By analyzing customer behaviors, companies know precisely who they’re targeting, and, with that knowledge, they ultimately learn what resources and tactics are required to retain these ideal customers.1. Keeping track of all of your customersWith these top customer attrition tools, it’s challenging to understand the behavior of every one of your customers. Information is gathered about many customers, and such information raises more questions. Customers slip through the cracks because of a lack of more profound insight into the information gathered. The solution is to track your customers throughout their journey with your business. 2. Knowing if they’ve contracted or churnedAnother difficult aspect of understanding customer attrition using some popular tools available is the inability to know if the customer has been downgraded or has churned completely. There are different reasons for customer attrition, and most of these tools do not provide insight into those nuances.There are many ways to win back customers that have disengaged.3. Use Baremetrics to monitor customer attrition rate On your Baremetrics dashboard, you can learn why customers canceled; you can also correlate lost revenue with cancellation reasons. In addition, Baremetrics can capture fresh insights regarding the reason for cancellation. With the insights you’ll gather on your dashboard, you’ll understand which missing features are driving your customers away and whether your retention efforts are working.Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, is the loss of a customer by a business. The rate at which a SaaS business loses customers is an important indicator of its health. Revenue churn, on the other hand, is a measure of the lost revenue by a business. Two revenue churn measurements are often crucial to SaaS businesses: revenue churn from lost or canceled subscriptions and revenue churn from downgrades.You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your subscription revenue accurately and efficiently. When considering ways to increase customer retention, keep in mind that customers don’t just randomly decide to cancel their subscriptions. There’s usually a reason behind cancellation; some of these reasons you can understand and fix, others you can’t.Here are some common reasons customers cancel their subscriptions.1. Lack of quick responsive supportA common reason customers stop using a service is a lack of quick and proactive support from service providers. When customers experience setbacks while using a product, they usually contact the support team to make their complaints.Some companies proactively have automated emails that let customers know that their complaints have been received and will be attended to soon. If the customer’s complaint isn’t addressed within a reasonable timeframe, it leaves the customer in the dark. With no feedback, the customer will most likely prefer to cancel their subscription. 2. Bugs in the productEven after you’ve tested your product over and over again, customers may still find bugs while they are using the software. Customers rely on your product for their businesses and general success. When customers experience glitches in your software, they may lose revenue, and, if it happens continuously, it may lead them to lose interest in the product. 3. Wrong target customer baseWhen you attract customers who are not a perfect fit for your business, they may discontinue their use of your product. Customers who find success while using your product are more likely to stick around. 4. Poor user experience Great features will attract customers to your product. However, if the product’s user experience is not impeccable, customers will find it hard to stay. Customer expectations based on user experience are high.These high expectations are why you see many companies losing customers because their competitor’s product has better usability. When enduring a product with a poor user experience, it’s only a matter of time until the customer finds an alternative. 5. Interaction failureYour customer adopts your product because there’s a problem they want to solve. Maybe your product offers more features than an alternative product in the same space, and that’s why your customer decided to get your product.With such expectations in mind, if your product does not quickly help your customer achieve outcomes, the customer’s morale will be dampened, and, if the customer experiences a failure in their interaction with your brand, they are very likely to discontinue use.1. Have a clear target audienceA clear target persona is crucial to increasing customer retention. When you have an intimate understanding of your customer, you’ll ensure that every part of your brand reflects the problem you are solving. 2. Give your customer proactive supportA reliable support center for your business is a worthy investment. Set a clear expectation (e.g., when feedback will be available) for customers who reach out to your support team. Prioritize real-time support (i.e., live chat windows) if you can afford it. 3. Test and improve your user experienceThe rewards for having beta testers always checking your product far outweigh the costs. When you release a new product update, collaborate with beta testers who will work with your team to discover ways to improve your user experience. 4. Make it easy for customers to report bugsWhen customers experience a glitch, how easy is it to report the glitch to you? Some brands make it possible for customers to report glitches through emails and pop-up notifications.5. Ensure that your onboarding process is results orientedThe onboarding process of many businesses does not emphasize smooth transitioning. Transitioning is essential from the moment a customer signs up to the point where they can solve their problem using your product. Understand your product’s selling point and design your onboarding process to get your customers there quickly.Preventing churn is super important to any company. Most companies even have someone solely dedicated to churn reduction. The reason for churn usually stems from the product, but there are other subtle reasons, including involuntary churn. Keep in mind that the reasons above are just a start.To learn more and stay ahead of your customer churn, you should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your attrition rate accurately and efficiently.\n"

      "How to Import, Augment, and Segment Customers in Baremetrics.\n",
      "Baremetrics makes it easy to understand customer data and make data-driven decisions. This article will walk you through the process of importing, augmenting, and segmenting customer data to get the insights you’re looking for. SaaS and subscription businesses rely on Baremetrics for metrics, dunning, customer engagement, and more. Start a free trial today. If you haven’t already, you’ll need to import data from sources like Stripe, Braintree, and Recurly. If you use multiple data sources, we encourage you to import from those sources, as well. Doing so enriches your data and makes it possible to run complex analyses and get more detailed insights.It’s important to keep in mind that multiple data sources will combine for some metrics in Baremetrics. This means you won’t be able to break out metrics by individual data source in all graphs.If you haven’t yet, connect your first data source. Allow the import and calculations to finish, and then your dashboard will be displayed. Once you have your first data source in place, head to the Data Connections page in Settings.  Now that you have a data source in place, you can think about augmenting your data even further. Augmenting your data from external sources via Zapier, CSV files, and our API allows you to enrich your existing data with even more information. For example, maybe you’re wondering which of your marketing channels is driving more MRR. Or how do the churn rates compare of customers that rated you a 5 NPS score versus a 10. With Augmentation, you can add those fields to your customer profiles and then segment by those new attributes (we’ll cover segmenting later in the article!) To start augmenting, head to the Customers tab, right under the filters for Segments.Connecting via Zapier is super simple. For more information, check our guide on integrating with Zapier.Similarly, connecting with our API is also fairly easy if you have some coding experience.If you’re looking to connect via .csv, however, there are three things you should keep in mind: Now here’s where the fun really begins. Customer segmentation breaks down metrics into smaller subsets of data. Instead of looking at broad averages, segmented metrics get really specific in dissecting customer behavior.In other words, segmenting customers in Baremetrics helps you simplify big problems and find data-driven solutions.With 25+ different attributes, there is a near limitless number of ways you can group your customers to get the information you’re looking for. Begin in the Customers area of Baremetrics. Then click \"Add Filter\" on the left hand side and you'll be able to search or scroll through every attribute available. Once you save a segment, you’ll get instant access to the MRR, ARPU, and Active Customers of the segment.If you want to refer to this segment often, or see its historical data, you can save it.To learn how the Baremetrics team segmented our customer base by:The ever powerful cohort table can be broken down by a segment. Use this to dive into when in the customer lifecycle a particular group of customers tends to churn.Cohorts are a special segment we use for measuring User Churn and Revenue Churn.

Track growth, make comparisons, and ultimately make more informed decisions powered by the Baremetrics toolkit.If you’re not already using Baremetrics, don’t wait. Start your free trial today.\n",
      "Reactivating Subscriptions: Resuming Metrics for your Subscriptions.\n",
      "What does it mean to reactivate a subscription? There are several reasons a customer would cancel their subscription. It could be that the customer got no return on investment, had technical difficulties, or they may have canceled because they achieved their set goal. Reactivating the subscription could mean many things, but primarily it means the customers decided to activate the subscription and make payment for another billing cycle.Before thinking about reactivating disengaged customers, preventing churn is super important to any company. The reason for churn usually stems from the product, but there are other subtle reasons, including involuntary churn.To learn more and stay ahead of your customer churn, you should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start monitoring your attrition rate accurately and efficiently.The Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) from reactivated subscriptions measures the revenue received from previously canceled subscriptions that were reactivated in that month. Customers may reactivate their subscriptions because they suddenly find value in your service or because they believe you offer more value than the available alternatives.Reactivation MRR is a metric that tells you why your customers decided to reactivate their subscriptions. This metric gives you the most information when you combine it with strategically asking them why they wanted to cancel their subscription and what brought them back. When a customer deactivates their subscription and signs up again, Baremetrics can continuously monitor the whole lifetime of the client, from before cancellation through to reactivation.As a Baremetrics subscriber, you have essential insights at your fingertips; you can monitor your customer sign-ups and cancellations on your dashboard while using emails and drop-in forms to collect feedback.With personalized email sequences, you can target customers who cancel their subscriptions. These emails will prompt customers to pick a reason for their cancellations and also share additional feedback.Using drop-in forms, you can collect cancellation reasons in real-time. The drop-in forms pop up when the user wants to cancel. On your Baremetrics dashboard, you can customize the form to reflect your company’s growth phase. Even the in-app widget in Baremetrics is fully customizable and offers a more convenient way to collect cancellation reasons. You can utilize the in-app widget and email to capture every possible reason for cancelation.Cancelation insights inform you on which features you can add to your product. By analyzing all the data you’ve collected from reactivated subscriptions, you can find out if the effort you’re putting in toward reducing churn is paying off. The insights go further to show you which of your competitors are costing you the most money.Using Baremetrics, you can create automated follow-up email sequences based on the cancelation reason. Inside these emails, you can offer discounts and send personalized messages that will help you gather even more feedback concerning your attrition. In the most popular payment gateways, subscriptions and billing will continue until cancellation. Besides a customer voluntarily opting out of a subscription, a customer’s subscription may also be canceled automatically after four to five attempts to bill the customer. Here’s how reactivation works on some popular payment gateways.On Stripe, if a customer’s subscription is canceled by updating the command function “cancel_at_period_end” to true and the subscription has not yet reached the end of a billing period, it can be reactivated. Subscriptions canceled instantly cannot be reactivated.To reactivate a subscription on Stripe, the customer can also use the reactivate subscription option on the client dashboard. If a customer has completed their cancelation and their subscription becomes inactive, a new subscription would be the only option if the customer wants to reactivate their account.Similar to Stripe, a subscription in Chargebee may be canceled voluntarily or after a few attempts to bill the customer. To restart the billing cycle, the customer would need to reactivate their subscription.Chargebee lets you reactivate through their API as well as their web interface. The customer can specify the date and time that they want Chargebee to consider the subscription reactivated. If you are interested in Chargebee, you should read our recent review.Customers reactivating a previously canceled subscription on Chargify have a couple of scenarios to consider.To reactivate on Chargify, the customer simply navigates the subscriptions tab on the platform and clicks on the reactivate button.When customers cancel their subscription, you don’t just fold your arms and watch them—you do everything in your power to encourage them to reactivate. Winback emails are beneficial when it comes to getting customers to resubscribe. There are several reasons a customer cancels their subscription. By strategically employing Winback email campaigns, you can get some of your customers to engage with your business again or, at the very least, find out why they opted out of your service. The reactivation campaigns that businesses employ will mostly depend on the type of product or service sold. The most successful reactivation campaigns inspire curiosity, display new concepts, and ultimately remind the customer why they signed up in the first place.For retail brands, an excellent reactivation campaign could display limited offers. This type of email serves a dual purpose of reminding the customer that your brand exists and, hopefully, triggering them to make a purchase.If your SaaS product has an inbuilt trial period, your reactivation campaigns can produce even more value. Here are three reactivation campaigns to explore.This reactivation campaign is primarily used to lure the customer into exploring a part of a product for a limited time in exchange for personal information. Some companies use this type of reactivation email to trigger customers who went halfway in performing actions on their platform, such as filling out a questionnaire or leaving a product in the cart.Suppose a customer signs up on your platform and receives a quiz designed to learn enough about them to ensure that you create the right pitch for a free trial of your product. That is all good and fine, but what happens if a customer starts answering the quiz and stops halfway? You can employ a freemium-to-trial reactivation campaign to reignite their interest. Once a customer signs up for a free trial, that event marks a big part of the customer acquisition process. The trial period could last from one week to over three months. The company should have ample time to show the customer that the product is a good investment during the trial period. However, the customer may abruptly stop using the product during the trial period, thereby missing out on the chance of deriving maximum utility from the product.You’ll need creative ways to remind customers to continue using your product to enjoy all its benefits. You also want to artfully show your trial customers the benefits of the paid version of your product—nothing cheesy, just campaigns designed to show your customers that you care and that there’s more untapped value in your business. This type of reactivation campaign doesn’t just stop at encouraging free trial customers to continue with the service; it also shows them the benefits of the paid version of your product. This type of reactivation campaign targets customers who canceled their subscriptions for one reason or the other. The reason for cancellations should be taken into account because it would impact the details employed in the winback campaign. The customer may cancel a service because they no longer have the funds for the service, they may have found a cheaper alternative, or it could simply be that the customer forgot to update their payment details.With Baremetrics Cancellation Insights, you’ll know precisely why a customer’s subscription was canceled. With such information, you’ll be able to fashion the best winback campaign that will make your customers feel like you are a mind reader. \n"

      "What Are Accounts Receivable?.\n",
      "Let’s be honest; I hate accounting jargon and hate jargon-filled explanations even more.This article will explain what accounts receivable are and how they are done in traditional and SaaS businesses.Make sure to read until the end-- I am going to tell you a secret that could save you $100,000s in annual SaaS revenue.Imagine you run a mango business named Sweet Mangoes. On a fine summer morning, Joey, who runs an ice cream parlor, comes to you and buys ten mangoes worth $5. He pays you the money right away.Here, a transaction was made—you gave the mangoes and received the money for it. You record $5 in your assets as cash received. Nothing complicated is happening here.Now, what if Joey doesn’t have that money at the moment so you give him the mangoes but don’t receive the money right away? He promises to give it to you after a week and you send him an invoice mentioning everything. We know this as selling on credit.How do you record this transaction?It depends on your accounting procedure; if you follow cash basis accounting, you record nothing until you get paid. If you follow accrual basis accounting, you record the transaction as accounts receivable.The $5 invoice is receivable to you, and it is an asset since you have earned it even though you don’t have it in cash.To put this more formally:Accounts receivable are the money your customers owe you for the goods or services you have delivered to them but they have yet to pay. Accounts receivable go on the assets side of the balance sheet since that money belongs to you, even though you have not received it yet.Now that we know what accounts receivable are, let’s learn about accounts payable .Accounts receivable and accounts payable are simply two sides of the same coin. If the money is owed to your business, you record it in the accounts receivable, since you will receive that money in the future. On the other hand, the business which owes you that money records it in the accounts payable since it has to be paid in the future.While accounts receivable are an asset, accounts payable are a liability.Let’s go through the entire process step by step to understand how accounts receivable work in a traditional business.Outstanding invoicesThe first step of documenting accounts receivable is sending an invoice to the customer.An invoice is a document that keeps a record of the transaction by stating all the goods and services you have delivered to the buyer. It also mentions the amount of money the buyer owes you and the time within which they have to pay.We refer to unpaid invoices as outstanding invoices, and, if they are still unpaid after the due date, we call them past due invoices. Both are receivables.Finding information on the balance sheetThe journal entry for the above-mentioned transaction would look like this:On the balance sheet, accounts receivable can be found under the current assets—i.e., cash or receivables expected to convert into cash within a year—while accounts payable can be found under current liabilities.Following up with invoicesNow comes the annoying part: How do you convert the receivables into cash? You have to make sure that you get paid promptly or else your business will suffer.Unfortunately, there are several reasons for which the invoices could remain unpaid. You have to follow up with your customers and remind them to pay. The best practice is to not wait for too long and to be professional.The above deals with receivables in traditional businesses. But, since you are here, you are likely more concerned with SaaS businesses. So, let's move on to that.Unlike the outstanding or overdue invoices in traditional businesses, accounts receivable in a SaaS business look different.This is because of the fundamental difference between the traditional business model involving one-time purchases and the SaaS business model involving recurring revenue.Failed credit card paymentsIn SaaS businesses, accounts receivable typically come from failed credit card payments. Credit card payment failures can occur for many reasons, such as expiration, lack of funds, or geographical location.Regardless of what caused them, failed payments can give a sharp blow to your business in two ways.First, while, in a traditional business, an unpaid invoice would only affect the fixed one-time revenue that was supposed to come from a purchase, in a SaaS or subscription business, a failed payment affects the long-term recurring revenue as well. It may also cause the customer to unintentionally churn altogether.Second, you will drain your resources following through on failed payments, which could otherwise be spent more productively.Outstanding overagesAnother type of receivables in SaaS is outstanding overages. If you are not familiar with overages, here’s a brief explanation.There are different pricing models in SaaS businesses, and one of them is the hybrid pricing model of recurring fee + usage fees. There are various pricing systems within the usage-based model as well, each with its benefits and limitations.In the overage pricing model, a company gives the customer a certain number of units for a particular period. If the usage exceeds the limit during the billing period, the customer is charged per unit for the extra usage.Now that you understand receivables and failed payments, let’s see what you can do about them.Dunning emailsDunning has a bad reputation because of how companies usually approach it, which can upset customers.Following a proper dunning process, however, not only minimizes the loss in revenue but also can help you build a better relationship with your customers by adding customer touchpoints.What is that process? You simply spend all day meticulously sending emails to your customers telling them that their payment has failed, and they need to do something about it.Sounds fun, right? And customers are willing to bang their head on a wall trying to figure out what exactly they need to do, right? Yeah, this couldn’t be farther from the truth.The truth is that you need good dunning management software to save yourself and your customers from all this fuss or else you are going to lose money.So, let me present to you one of the best dunning management tools that makes the whole thing a piece of cake.On average, SaaS businesses lose 9% of their revenue every month to failed payments (or even more, as the number of customers increases). Something must be done to prevent this.As discussed above, the answer is dunning, but it can be a complete headache if you don’t have a proper system in place.What if there were a magic wand that could fix it all with a swish-and-flick? Sadly, there’s no such wand, but there’s something just as good—Baremetrics Recover.Recover takes care of all your failed payments and stops your revenue from leaking out.Here is how you can start recovering your lost SaaS business revenue in four simple steps:1. Enable Recover on your Baremetrics Dashboard. It takes just one click to enable the Recover add-on and to recover your lost revenue. For this, you must have a Baremetrics account. If you don’t have one, sign up for the Baremetrics free trial now.2. Set up automated drip campaigns for failed payments.We have nearly a dozen ready-to-use and customizable email sequences for you.

Copy our code snippet to enable in-app reminders for your customers to let them know about the payment failure.You can also choose how much time you allow your customers to use your product before they are forced to update their payment method.4. Send your customers to a customizable form to update their billing details.Those emails and in-app reminders send your customers to an easy-to-follow credit card form. You can set those forms on a Baremetrics sub-domain or your personal domain with your own branding.That’s it!It can’t get any easier than that. It’s a one-time job that is probably the highest ROI activity you can do in your business.No, that’s not an exaggeration.

      "Quick Ratio vs. Current Ratio vs. Acid Test Ratio.\n",
      "Business leaders in every niche look to financial ratios and metrics to evaluate their company’s performance. It is no different in SaaS, and every year Baremetrics helps more SaaS companies keep an eye on these ratios to grow as rapidly as possible.Given the unique nature of the SaaS industry, it is not unusual to find that some financial ratios within this niche will look a lot different from typical industry financial ratios. This article details three key ratios for your SaaS company: the current ratio, quick ratio, and acid test ratio.Together, these financial ratios offer easy insight into a company’s sufficiency through its many growth (or dip) phases. When we say easy insight, here’s an example of what we mean:If you were told that your company’s quick ratio is below 1, would you know what it means?Yes! With these numbers at your fingertips, it’s easy to understand where your company stands financially.True to its name, the quick ratio is a financial analysis metric that is quick to calculate because it does not contain as many variables as, e.g., the current ratio in its calculation. All you need to calculate the quick ratio is accurate records of the assets and liabilities for the month under review.The formula for calculating the quick ratio is detailed below:The only assets applied during this calculation are those kinds of assets that can be converted to cash within 90 days. Take a look at the variables included in the formula above. The assets, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, include marketable investments and accounts receivable, which are the liquid assets accessible within 90 days of the analysis.These assets that are readily liquid in such a short time are called quick assets.The answer is not quite. Calculating the SaaS quick ratio is slightly different from the way it is estimated in other industries. It’s different for reasons that will become immediately clear when calculating the quick ratio of a sample SaaS company later in this article.For now, let’s just say that SaaS companies look at assets and liabilities through different lenses, and their financial analysis reflects that outlook. For very good reason, you will find that the most talked about financial ratio is the quick ratio. It’s quick, easily calculable, and an executive cannot make a wrong decision by applying only the quick ratio. However, the popularity enjoyed by the quick ratio does not make the current ratio any less useful in decision making.The quick ratio calculates values that apply to the short term, whereas the current ratio looks at longer (e.g., one year or more) periods. When you think of the current ratio, think of current assets and current liabilities; these variables are involved in its calculation.The current assets on every balance sheet include inventory, cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, prepaid expenses, and accounts receivable. The values of these assets are usually convertible to cash within one year.The current liabilities include all debts and obligations that are to be settled within one year. Short-term debt, accounts payable, and other accrued debts and liabilities are examples of current liabilities.Current assets are added up and divided by the total current liabilities to obtain the current ratio:Current Ratio = (Total Current Assets) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities)If Company A has accrued liabilities worth $100,000 while its current assets stand at $150,000, the current ratio stands at 1.5. For Company A, this means they are slightly out of trouble, but not in a great place either. With a current ratio of less than one, there are fewer current assets than liabilities, which is considered a risk to creditors and shareholders. At 1.5, the value of the current assets may be slightly higher, but, after the current liabilities are settled, the company might be in the red.The acid test ratio is actually just another name for the quick ratio in financial analysis. It is often helpful in more situations than the current ratio as it ignores all the assets that are not easy to liquidate. If the acid test ratio is much lower than the current ratio, it means that there are more current assets that are not easy to liquidate (e.g., more inventory than cash equivalents). If Company A’s acid test ratio or quick ratio is 1.1, it means that Company A depends more heavily on inventory than any other current asset. This finding is not an indication of imminent danger, but a closer look at the type of company that shows these numbers can reveal more information.If Company A is a retail store, these numbers (current ratio and acid test ratio) might not be cause for alarm because retail stores typically have a lot of inventory. However, if Company A is a SaaS company, these numbers could be terrible news.Quick assets can be quickly culled from current assets when there are no separate records of the company’s quick assets. The quick ratio is calculated using fewer variables than the current ratio, and its value can readily signal the company’s short-term financial health.If you’re worried about covering debts and liabilities within the next 90 days, the quick ratio will provide you with the most useful information. Interestingly, for companies with no inventory assets, the quick ratio and current ratio may be identical, except for a few minor differences, such as some accounts receivable that are not easy to liquidate.Whereas the quick ratio is lauded as the more beneficial financial ratio of the two, the type of company or industry where this financial analysis is conducted is worth noting. Omitting the inventory in calculating the quick ratio for a supermarket (where inventory is often moved quickly) may not provide an accurate view of that supermarket’s financial health or liquidity.In different companies, these financial ratios can fluctuate. If care is not taken, it is easy to lose sight of accurate financial metrics on which essential decisions can be based.As noted frequently in this article, the niche industry matters when financial ratios are calculated. A SaaS company’s views of its current assets and liabilities are incomparable to those of a retail store or supermarket, and this unique perspective is reflected in financial analysis.That said, a SaaS company can still apply the quick ratio to provide valuable insights on the direction of its growth.The quick ratio is defined above, and a formula is provided. However, the quick ratio formula provided is generic and applies in several industries, but the variables computed are different when it comes to the SaaS industry.The SaaS quick ratio is different from every other quick ratio calculation you may find in financial analysis articles and books: Below is an example of values computed by Company Z to depict their SaaS quick ratio.Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses that bring in revenue through subscription-based services. Baremetrics can integrate directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pull information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard.Baremetrics brings you metrics, dunning, engagement tools, and customer insights. Some of the things Baremetrics monitors are MRR, ARR, LTV, the total number of customers, total expenses, quick ratio, and more.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start managing your subscription business right.Table 1. SaaS quick ratio example.SaaS Quick Ratio = ($150k + $100k + $125k) ÷ $90k = 4.2From the information in Table 1, it may already be clear that Company Z is growing efficiently. Company Z shows increased growth MRR (i.e., the sum of new MRR, reactivation MRR, and expansion MRR) and low churn. However, it isn’t enough to glance at the table and decide the company is growing; the exact value of your SaaS quick ratio can mean different things.Understanding where your company’s SaaS quick ratio falls within the industry ranges can tell you what parts of your business need improvement. For the example above, you could decide that lowering your churn rate even more in the coming months will keep your company in the green. You may be correct, but Table 2 gives you the quickest view of the next steps for your company.Table 2. SaaS quick ratio ranges.As easy as it is to write up Company Z’s MRR in Table 1, the numbers are messier before they get to that point. Your SaaS company likely uses CRM and/or payment processing software, and the data required to compute all required MRR values can be all over the place.

      "Remote Work for Startups: 5 Tips for Virtually Managing Your Team.\n",
      "A major issue that remote startups face is managing their teams. After all, asynchronous communication can have a serious negative impact on growing companies  if not done effectively.   This article will discuss ways startups can better manage their remote team’s communication and workflow. Remote SaaS and subscription companies rely on Baremetrics for financial insights that grow their businesses. Start a free trial today.Hiring international employees can benefit your organization by bringing in skills that are scarce in your location. This not only diversifies the skill set of an entire workforce, but also provides access to a global talent pool for any job opening within or outside their expertise. Remote work benefits employees because it offers them opportunities without needing to relocate and uprooting themselves from family and friends- all while still working on something they love!Like mentioned previously, communication is the spine of a project, of a collaboration. Distance makes it harder to communicate but there are several applications, such as Slack, Notion and Calendly that make it easier to collaborate with your teammates and employees. Finally, Calendly eliminates the hassle of back-and-forth emails and makes scheduling easier than ever before, saving you precious hours that can be spent on more important tasks like growing your business or completing projects ahead of deadlines.Thanks to online collaboration tools, it is now much easier to work with remote workers than ever before. Online teams can interact with each other and brainstorm ideas and hold virtual meetings in actual real-time. On the other hand, assignment-related tools such as Trello for instance, allows the manager to assign work to various members of the team. They can check up on each other's progress and give a helping hand in a way that feels like being in the same room together.  Moreover, there are yet other platforms and you can assign them projects, discuss them with your teammates, share and exchange files related to the project with them, have them share their opinions and feedback on it, and when the project is being worked on, you can always conduct virtual meetings to take updates from them about the progress of the project.Make sure that before you choose an application for communication, you consider all of its features and choose the best one out of them.There are several methods available on the internet by which you can send and receive files securely. You could use anyone from the various options available, but always make sure that the format in which you send a file is not just limited to that particular application and try choosing a more common format. For example Google Docs is one of the best platforms out there for sharing files. You can just make a worksheet on MS Excel and paste the link of the file created on Google Docs on that list, so that everyone would be able to access it. File transfer is a crucial step since it helps you in collaborating better with all your teammates. Also, the application has to be safe for exchanging important data. There are several applications that lock a file with a password and therefore endure its privacy.Although sharing files has its own importance, it is more common knowledge. There are other applications that help with security and people might not be aware of them, such as 2 factor authentication and Team Password.  Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security measure that can be used to protect your account. You must enter an additional code when you sign in, and the Two-Factor Authentication feature supports two types of authentication methods: authenticator apps or email address authentication systems. TeamPassword is a secure password management and sharing service for teams that simplifies access to shared passwords. It lets team members log in with just one click, and shares credentials from within the app so they're always up-to-date.Something crucial for startups that could be usually overlooked is paying attention to finding writing professionals. This could be important for different reasons, such as having them write excellent reviews for your products or build a good presence for your subscription business blog with informative articles. Among this profession is a CER Writing, popular mostly in the medical field.A clinical evaluation report writer is a person who writes reports about a clinical product or method or anything that has been administered to a person or in a venture. The ACER writer is supposed to write about the time of administration and mention all the details about it, especially about the feedback, the success rate of the trial, and the side effects noticed (if any). This will help startups appear truthful in the eyes of their audience. If you're a new startup trying to figure out your journey through remote working strategy, make sure you keep a track of all the projects that are being worked upon and all the employees who are working in them. You can even hire a team or an individual that keeps a track of the work done by your employees and makes the process of evaluation easy for you.Another way of how teams can keep track of projects and hours completed is by making use of different softwares online. For instance, Project Management Software is an online platform that allows users to report the time they spent working on tasks and projects. There is also Forecast, another platform to run all project operations. Something else that definitely adds value for startups is freelancing. Freelancing as a career option allows people to take jobs of their choice and with the comfort and facility of working for as many companies they like at a time. Most Freelancers have experience in working from home, which means you won’t have to help them acclimate to a remote team setting. These people operate outside the ambit of a proper office structure. This means you are not responsible for their health insurance coverage, their medical bills, transport, and mobile allowances not to mention gratuities and provident funds. They work at their own convenience and at their own timings. Since they are not technically your employees, but outside contractors, you are not beholden to them any more than they are beholden to you. A freelancer can work on multiple projects at the same time, while you can also hire many such individuals for the same project. Startups usually hire freelancers to complete projects that small teams may not have bandwidth to accomplish. If either of you is dissatisfied in any way, you can simply discontinue working with each other. Best of all, your freelancers offer you the very best services you can find literally on this planet. When you outsource to a freelancer, you can use the whole world as your recruiting ground and buy the best possible services at the best rates. Working in an office would mean that you are constrained by geographical boundaries and certain laws regarding employing people in an office. However, a freelancer working from another continent won’t be subject to the same laws as your office workers. Start-ups are not new to the market and countless people dream of launching their start-up. It takes a lot to lead a start-up to the path of success. Adjusting to the present circumstances, several startups have started practicing working from home.  This is a great opportunity. A fresh start-up won’t have to spend precious resources on creating a working space by purchasing or hiring commercial property. They can get to work by simply hiring people from anywhere they like and on terms and conditions acceptable to everyone. They could especially focus their workforce internationally so the chances of finding even better talent are increased.While managing remote work, one should consider hiring freelancers. Choose an efficient platform for communicating, such as Slack, Notion and Calendly and find apps to secure your work. Remote teams use Baremetrics to keep a pulse on 26+ subscription metrics.

      "6 Tips for Hiring off Upwork.\n",
      "If you’re not familiar with Upwork, stop what you’re doing and read this.The online platform describes itself as a 'marketplace that connects businesses to independent talent from around the world'. To the busy founder, Upwork is nothing short of a small miracle. Busy founders often have tasks that they need done right away, but don’t have the time to do themselves.Eventually, teams might hire an employee for miscellaneous tasks. But for right now, all you need is Johnny-on-the-spot to just get it done. That’s where a marketplace like Upwork comes in.As a business, you can post a task, no matter how large or small, on your profile. People seeking work in that field will see your posting, and be able to apply for it with a work proposal. You can also seek out workers, aka ‘talents’, on the website, and approach them directly with a job.This article will cover everything you need to know to successfully hire off Upwork. To get started, it’s important to understand Upwork’s review system. Public ratings and reviews are the key to establishing mutual trust on the website. Employers and candidates alike maintain profiles that list reviews from people they’ve worked with on the site, along with ratings out of five stars, as well as other key statistics pertaining to their job activity.Here’s an example of a review written about a freelance animator. Due to the weight of the review system, talents and employers alike tend to be on their best behaviour. For that reason, Upwork hires tend to involve less haggling, nickel-and-diming, and other complications that can come with independent contracting.Having so many independent contractors to choose from can, however, seem like finding a needle in the haystack.How do you sift through dozens of proposals for the same job? How can you guarantee quality? We’ll answer these questions Growing businesses use Baremetrics to get real-time insights into 26+ business metrics. Start your free trial today.Upwork is an excellent platform for start-ups to outsource simple jobs. For maximum efficiency, you’ll want to focus on outsourcing tasks that require a minimum amount of involvement on your part after the initial hiring stage. Data entry, transcription, caller reviews etc are some examples of jobs requiring minimal training and management and thus make ideal candidates for farming out.Tasks, on the other hand, that require frequent check-ins with your company, are less time efficient. You might find that between training new hires, performing quality controls, and giving periodic instructions, you are actually wasting more time than if you handled them internally.With no enforceable employment contract, there is also no guarantee of longevity in these work relationships. Any training you provide is an investment you might never see the returns on – in our experience, it’s best to select a candidate who has the necessary skill set prior to hire, and to not shy away from letting someone go right away if their results are unsatisfactory.You should also be extremely wary of providing any sensitive or actionable data. The downside of dealing with a global workforce is that legally, you have very little come-back if you find that your data has been misused, sold, or your confidentiality breached.Like any tool, the key to using Upwork successfully is to know how that tool is best used, and sticking to that.We mentioned the risk of data misuse earlier. This also applies to your public profile: never provide any names or contact details for your company, business contacts, or clients.Publishing this data often results in enterprising talents spamming clients directly, which could easily end a business-client relationship.Now we have the profile ‘do nots’, let’s dive into the ‘must haves’.An Upwork profile represents a business’s reputation on the site. This is expressed through a combination of user reviews and statistics.If you want to attract good candidates, you need to be an attractive employer. Posting regular jobs, paying decently for them, rewarding good work with good ratings (which generally boomerang into positive reviews for you as the employer) all contribute to an attractive profile.Bear in mind that anyone can see the reviews you post. We would caution against leaving negative reviews as it can reflect poorly on your business, or even provoke a retaliatory rebuke on your front-page profile. The more specific the job posting, the more likely it is that the right people will apply for it, saving you hours of reviewing irrelevant or unrealistic proposals.Avoid vague requests like ‘make me a website’. Give precise guidelines such as ‘build a website with CSS and Javascript, no templates’ instead. You can also include ‘do nots’, for example, ‘do not apply unless you have immediate availability’.Making an explanatory video for each job posting is an efficient way to communicate your needs, especially if you’re hiring several people to work on the same project.Record yourself as you complete two example tasks. Showing the process is often the clearest explanation. In addition, running through the tasks yourself should flag any unpredicted issues, or highlight any additional information workers need to complete the task without requiring further instruction along the way.Here are some key characteristics we look for in a high-quality Upworker:Hourly rates listed on someone’s profile tend to be counter-intuitive. Often people charging mid-range prices work faster than low-range prices, so hiring someone at a higher hourly rate might eventually work out cheaper. Instead of relying on hourly rates which tend to be unpredictable, we recommend offering a fixed price for most types of work.Here’s an example of a job posting seeking experienced content writers. For larger jobs, consider jumping on a call with your most promising candidates. Beyond putting a face to the profile, establishing a two-way relationship is important for building a sense of personal responsibility and loyalty, and creates a channel for ongoing discussion. If it’s your first time working with someone, it’s important to monitor them through the early stages to make sure they’re delivering what you need. The review system is a great tool, but ultimately you do need to check the quality of the work yourself and not rely solely on external metrics. Workers submit their own qualifications, and this information is not strictly verified: in a competitive job market, people can and do lie about their own qualifications and abilities.For quality control purposes, make sure you’re checking their work after two tasks, after ten, then after fifty, for example. If they’re delivering subpar work, the earlier it’s caught the better.If you don’t have the resources to perform QC yourself, consider hiring multiple people in the early stages to execute exactly the same task in order to determine who performs the best. Letting candidates know there’s a healthy competition can also encourage productivity!Let’s say you’re hiring ten separate workers for a data entry gig. You can avoid managing each talent individually by setting up a spreadsheet listing 100 tasks, and having each person put their name against the task they’re currently tackling. This way the Upwork team can self-manage their availability and skill sets with minimal effort on your part.You might even create a hierarchical structure on the platform, hiring more senior talent to oversee a team of contributors.The team can then manage task distribution, quality control etc amongst themselves. The benefit of this is that it keeps you at arm’s length of negotiations, corrigible errors, and work allocation. The onus of training is also managed within the Upwork microcosm instead of requiring your attention.If a good trust relationship is established, consider bringing top-level Upworkers into your company slack so they can consult with the team directly.The gig system can just as well be adapted as a trialling platform to find great new talent for your team anywhere in the world: within the global pool of talent on Upwork, you might even find people to bring on board your company as fully fledged employees. Like with any form of hire on a consulting basis, there are a few risks to navigate while using Upwork to keep in mind.Legally for instance, online contracting work such as this is a grey area. Tax and employment regulations in particular are still catching up to a globalised job market.Make sure to consider legal advice, and always operate under appropriate insurance cover.Interested in a detailed analysis of your business metrics?

      "What is GAAP Accounting?.\n",
      "GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and standards. These procedures and principles are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). GAAP is important to SaaS Businesses. Revenue recognition, as per GAAP, states that payment is recognized as revenue after delivering the product or service in its entirety.  Of course, that’s not how SaaS revenue works. (We wrote more about revenue recognition here!) In the SaaS industry, subscription fees are paid as monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and can be paid in advance for up to a year. Following GAAP principles mean that revenue - even if received upfront - is calculated over a deferred period, one month at a time. If you are in the SaaS business, you need to familiarize yourself with GAAP to present your results to shareholders and other role players in a format they are already acquainted with. Fortunately, Baremetrics makes GAAP reporting (and all forms of SaaS financial reporting) easy! GAAP is the abbreviation of generally accepted accounting principles, standards, and procedures issued by the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board). Public companies in the United States follow GAAP principles to compile their financial statements. GAAP combines the standards set by policy boards and aims to improve the consistency and comparability of the accounting information. Financial reporting communicates a company's financial performance and results. By using a standardized best practice methodology, the company can benchmark accurately against its competitors. That way, the information regarding the financial position, revenues, and expenses are presented in a standardized, comparable accounting method that helps maintain consistency. GAAP ensures trust in financial markets. If every company could decide their reporting and calculation methods independently, it would be challenging for investors to analyze companies’ performance. If all companies calculate their results using the same standards, investors and regulators can compare like with like. There are ten rules that apply to GAAP accounting, including:These rules make the reporting process transparent and create standards for assumptions, terminology, methods, and definitions so that external parties can compare financial statements.  There are four basic principles of GAAP accounting. These guidelines separate the organization’s transactions from that of the owners, standardizes entries, and explicitly discloses periods used. They also draw on best practices for governance, disclosure, matching, and conservatism. This principle states that all listed values with accuracy, reflecting only actual cost and not many market value cost items or speculation. This was mentioned in the introductory paragraph of this article. Using GAAP’s revenue principle, revenue should only be reported when it's recognized. This often has an impact on SaaS businesses with deferred revenue streams. (More on this topic later!) GAAP principles govern how revenues are matched with expenses. Expenses of a revenue-producing activity are reported when the item or service is sold. It's not reported when the company receives payment or issues an invoice. For example, suppose an API developer is contracted to implement an API feed for a new SaaS client being onboarded. In that case, that expense is reported before the client’s first subscription payment kicks in. All the information that someone making inquiries about the financial status of a company needs is included in the report. Your GAAP accounting results will likely differ from your other measures. For example, in a SaaS company, you probably keep a close eye on your Monthly Recurring Revenue, but MRR is not a reportable GAAP revenue stream. For GAAP reporting purposes, you will likely report revenue pro-rata each day between the start and end date of the subscription, rather than as a monthly fixed revenue. In a practical example, you will likely recognize your revenue based on the date of invoice. Still, you would realize the payment over the subscription period (e.g., an entire month). If your client starts subscribing to your service on Feb 13th, and the subscription ends on March 12th at a $100 monthly fee, their daily fee is $3.57 according to GAAP principles. That means your monthly revenue in February (assuming it has 29 days) will be at $57.14, and the remaining $42.86 is attributed to March. GAAP is not legally binding, but all publicly traded and regulated companies must follow GAAP per the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors will usually prefer to work with GAAP-compliant companies, so it’s a good idea to follow the principles if you hope to secure additional investment. While the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prescribes the use of GAAP accounting standards in reporting, they aren’t involved in setting the actual GAAP standards themselves. Two boards are responsible for setting GAAP accounting standards, namely the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The GASB has jurisdiction over financial reporting by government entities, and the FASB is responsible for establishing rules for the private sector. Both boards are independent, non-governmental agencies. Members are appointed by the trustees of the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF). The FAF is an independent body responsible for the basic structure for establishing accounting principles. The FAF appoints GASB members, raises funding, and oversees governmental standard creation. FAF and GASB are also supported by the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Council (GASAC).Differences between GAAP accounting and IFRS accounting frameworksCompanies outside of the US are likely to use the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and not GAAP. This is an international standard developed by the International Accounting Standards Board. IFRS is used in 110 countries, including many Asian, EU, and South American countries, whereas GAAP is only applicable to the US.GAAP and IFRS standards generally share more similarities than differences, aside from two key differences. GAAP is rule-based, whereas IFRS is principle-based, as many industries may have industry-specific rules and guidelines to follow. In general, the IFRS leaves more room for interpretation and for companies to use their judgment. Under IFRS, investment property is defined as property held for rental income or capital appreciation. It’s initially valued at cost and then revalued to market value. Revaluation isn’t allowed under GAAP, but it is allowed under IFRS. You may be wondering whether you should start applying GAAP to your financial reporting. There are several reasons why GAAP reporting is a good idea, even if you aren’t a publicly traded entity. As mentioned, GAAP is viewed favorably by lenders, creditors, and investors. Many financial institutions will require an annual GAAP-compliant financial statement before issuing a business loan. Whether or not you apply GAAP to your business’s financial reports, you should be tracking your financial data and metrics. Growing SaaS and subscription businesses use Baremetrics to view their financial data in real-time via dynamic dashboards and forecasting tools. Start your free trial today. If you want to incorporate GAAP principles, you will have to supply three significant statements, including your income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. You’ll be able to quickly and easily set up these statements in your Baremetrics dashboards and keep up-to-date with the latest GAAP developments using the Baremetrics search functionality. Your balance sheet applies to a single point in time and covers your assets, liabilities, and shareholder’s equity. Your assets should be listed per subcategories in order of liquidity, followed by liability. The difference between the assets and liabilities is shown as the shareholders’ equity or the company's net worth. Your total assets should always be in balance with the sum of liabilities and shareholders’ equity. If it sounds complicated, don’t worry. You can find the data you need for balance sheets in Baremetrics. You can also check out our curated list of  real experts for additional accounting needs.There are several options if you would like to get GAAP accounting certified or simply improve your knowledge. Most courses will require prior accounting knowledge. Udemy has an affordable GAAP course to explore. It’s aimed at CPAs and other accounting professionals. There’s a $199 course for CIMA members available online. They also have a US GAAP Fundamentals for Finance Professionals course with a certificate for $399. Similar to Udemy, there are self-learning courses from $29 that can help you become familiar with GAAP practices. You can obtain a certificate from Ernst & Young following an 8-hour online course.While there are many benefits to GAAP, the basic principles of GAAP were designed in the 1980s, when most of a business's assets were physical. Digital companies have intangible assets, and balance sheets are limited in how it’s displayed, e.g., depreciation and benefits. Income statements aren’t particularly well suited for digital businesses because internally-created intangible assets like software development aren’t capitalized. In other words, software development that represents an asset is listed as an expense without matching revenue. Traditional GAAP financial statements don't account for many SaaS-specific metrics like Annual Recurring Revenue, Customer Lifetime Value, Revenue Churn, and more. These metrics are critical when it comes to evaluating the health of your business. Baremetrics will help you keep an eye on metrics that matter, as well as the GAAP accounting metrics you need for reporting purposes. It really is the best of both worlds!\n"

      "Acid Test Ratio Explained.\n",
      "Financial ratios are essential for decision-making in every SaaS company. An essential ratio for SaaS companies is the acid-test ratio and is commonly referred to as the quick ratio. In this article, we will take you through what the acid test ratio is, the acid test formula, how to calculate it, and more! True to its name, the acid-test ratio is easily and quickly calculable, especially using the Baremetrics integration. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26+ metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, and more. Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways, allowing you to view financial data in real-time via  smart dashboards. Start your free trial today.When considering finances in your SaaS company, it’s necessary to consider what your current assets and liabilities are. These two variables can cause the most anxiety in every balance sheet as they fluctuate month to month. What are the assets currently valued at? Can we continue running with our current liabilities? Can we pay off any short-term debts comfortably?These questions are quickly answered by the acid test ratio. What exactly makes up this ratio? Here are the variables:Between the cash or cash equivalents and any other easy-to-liquidate current assets that your company has, all current liabilities (especially short-term debt) should be quickly settled if your company’s growth is in the right direction. Staring at the balance sheet all day will not yield the right information for your decision-making, but using the correct formula and specified variables can get you there quickly. Let’s dive into what the acid test ratio is and how to use it in your business.Now we know what makes up the acid test ratio, it’s time to apply the formula below:If you're a SaaS company, you work hard to develop marketing strategies, lead generation, and nurturing sequences that finally land you new customers only to see that your monthly revenue growth is slipping due to downgrades or churn.Enter the Acid Test Ratio!This ratio is beneficial for calculating the movement of your growth (by subscriptions or other membership plans/bookings). For a SaaS company, the Acid Test Ratio or Quick Ratio is calculated slightly differently than the generic formula detailed earlier in this article. The SaaS Acid Test Ratio shows the net inflow and outflow of the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or annual recurring revenue (ARR) of your SaaS business.Company M Acid Test Ratio = New Bookings + Expansion Bookings ÷ Churn + Downgraded.With this formula, the essence of the calculation is maintained, which is growth divided by contraction.Company M’s Acid Test Ratio stands at the current value:A random entrepreneur looking at the Acid Test Ratio value calculated in the previous section may find that it holds no information they can understand. However, for a SaaS company executive, especially someone from an example like Company M, this number can give valuable insights in making future decisions.How so?The SaaS Acid Test Ratio can signal different situations. Here are three places you’ll typically find a SaaS company in following your acid test ratio:This means that your SaaS company is in a bad place. Your company can last a month or two as it is, but any further and the churn and contraction rates will bury your company.This means that your company is growing, but slowly. The slow growth could be because you’ll need to keep customer acquisition (and retention) efforts at high levels to replace lost or churned bookings or MRR.This means that the direction of growth is excellent and efficient. Generally speaking, it can be seen that for every $1 lost in revenue, $4 is earned back.With the SaaS Acid Test Ratio at your fingertips, it becomes easy to know what angles of your business require urgent attention or sustained efforts in the same direction. It may be difficult to pull the values you need to compute the SaaS Acid Test Ratio yourself. Integrating smart tools that track these monthly metrics is the most efficient way to go. This is where Baremetrics comes in. Growing SaaS and subscription businesses use Baremetrics to gain actionable insights from their financial data.

      "SaaS Price Increase: How to Raise Prices Without Upsetting Customers.\n",
      "For most SaaS businesses, customer acquisition is one of the most challenging stages of growth. For most, the easiest ways to increase customer acquisition rates are to offer a freemium model or price your product on the lower end of the spectrum.However, to keep your business afloat, you’ll need to effect a SaaS price increase. Not only will this help you increase your revenue, but it will also help give you a competitive edge in your industry.One of the reasons the SaaS business model is so attractive is that revenue is generated on a recurring basis. This is because your customers don’t purchase your software for a one-time fee. Instead, you charge them a monthly or annual fee for a service you deliver over the Internet. Because everything is delivered online through cloud computing, running costs are usually kept at a minimum. It is this factor that allows small to medium-scale startups to offer limited services for free to attract customers. It also helps create a tiered pricing structure to accommodate clients with different levels of buying power. However, if you don’t have a plan and strategy for raising your prices, this client attraction strategy will end up leading to your SaaS business running aground. Not only will you not be able to turn a decent profit, but it will starve you of the funding you need to:Many SaaS startups dread raising their prices because of the fear of losing customers. However, there’s more at stake than losing customers if you don’t raise your prices. A few high-stake reasons for raising your prices include:1. Results in an Increase in RevenueWhile this may be an obvious one, it’s also an important reason for a SaaS price increase. Profitability is essential to the survival of any business, especially SaaS startups.2. Increases the Value of Your ProductStatic pricing results in your product losing value over time, both financially and in the eyes of your target audience. Once your product gains notoriety as “the cheap” alternative, customers will always perceive your product as less valuable than its competitors.3. Ensures You Attract the Right CustomersUnderpricing your SaaS product can result in you attracting a totally different target demographic to the one you had initially planned on targeting. Keeping your pricing abreast of the perceived increase in the value of your product will ensure that you always attract the right customers. Yes, even if it means losing some customers.Like all businesses, there comes a time when you have to raise your prices. For SaaS businesses, knowing when to raise your prices can be tricky. Here are a few signs that can help you know when to raise your prices:Customer’s Use “Cheap” In Describing Your ProductOne of the first signs that you need to revise your pricing upwards is when customers use the word “cheap” and it's synonyms to describe your product. Whether they use it in conversations with you or in reviews comparing your product to its alternatives, this shows the value they place on it.Customers Don’t Push Back on PricingIf prospects never try to negotiate for better prices, even when your sales reps have the power to negotiate prices, it’s a sign that you’ve underpriced your product. You’re leaving tons of money on the table and need to increase your pricing.You’ve Recently Added New FeaturesNew features, especially those that prove valuable to users are a very good excuse to raise your pricing. Use customer feedback to gauge the value of your new features and revise your pricing accordingly.You’re Overwhelmed By DemandWhen the demand for your product overwhelms you, it’s a sign that people love your product. It could also be a sign that your product is a much-needed solution at that time — Zoom, the video conferencing platform, experienced this massive spike in 2020 that has sustained to present day. It’s also a hint that they’d be willing to pay more for it.Now that you know the why and when of a SaaS price increase, let’s dive into how you can raise your prices — and that without upsetting your customers.One of the safest ways of raising prices for your SaaS product is to raise them for new customers only. Use the lock-in rates method to keep your current customers happy while implementing a price increase for all new customers that sign up for your product. Make sure to inform existing users that the price for new customers will increase, but the prices for them will not change. This is grandfathering existing customers into your pricing packages and essentially means keeping existing customers at the same pricing level for a limited time or even forever.One reason this method is popular with many SaaS brands is that it reduces customer churn. It also positively impacts SaaS success metrics like monthly recurring revenue (MRR) that are essential in increasing the value of your brand.The only caveat is that metrics like your average revenue per user (ARPU) can be negatively impacted. Don’t worry, keeping track of important SaaS metrics like these is easy with Baremetrics.But what if you want to increase prices for existing users without upsetting them?The following steps will guide you on how to do just that. Before you raise your prices for existing customers, you must research your customers. This can mean redefining your ideal customer profile (ICP) and building more refined buyer personas. Other implications of customer research to consider as you plan on raising your prices include:To get a better picture of how your new prices will affect your current customers, you must run an impact analysis. Doing so will prepare you for the changes and also help you develop a strategy of how to reach out to customers who’ll be most impacted by the pricing changes. Competitor analysis is an integral part of strategically positioning your brand. It’s also a great way to benchmark what your customers are willing to pay for your product. More importantly, it helps you keep your pricing increment within customers’ expectations. One of the best ways to use competitor pricing to help you increase your own is by using the Van Westendorp model. This model involves asking your customers four simple questions:1. What price would you think is fair for the product and represents the best value for money?2. At what price point do you think the product is becoming expensive but still worth the investment?3. At what price would the product seem so inexpensive you’d doubt its quality?4. What price would you think is too expensive for you to continue using the product?The answers to these questions will help you determine your ideal product value and, ultimately, guide you toward the optimum price point for your SaaS product.Another way of effecting a SaaS price increase without upsetting your customers is by restructuring your pricing tiers.This method can allow your customers to continue paying the same price but with fewer features. Those who need more advanced features will be forced to upgrade, however, this change won’t be met with much resistance as the value of the features will speak for itself.On the same note, you could also use a new feature to introduce a new tier to your pricing structure.The biggest advantage of restructuring your tiers is that it gives your customers options. They won’t feel like they’re being strong-armed into paying more for your product. Because they feel they’re in control, they won’t feel the pain of the price increase.The trick to getting SaaS pricing right is communicating the true value of your product. The same is true when you want to raise your prices. Focus on selling the value your product adds to your customers more than the idea of hiking your prices. Doing so will help your customers better understand why you’re raising your prices. As a result, most will gladly continue using your product and happily pay your new rates.Increasing the price of your SaaS product need not be daunting. Done well, it can result in increased revenue and happier customers. Sure, you may lose some customers. However, having fewer customers isn’t always a bad thing. It can translate to fewer service requests, higher-quality customers, and better customer service on your part.With a well-planned and executed price increase strategy, raising your prices can be a win-win situation for you and your customers.\n"

      "How to set up Baremetrics Recover to Maximize ROI.\n",
      "Using a SaaS tool or feature for the first time can be difficult and even discouraging. You purchased with one goal in mind: increase revenue.When you aren’t sure how to use a tool or feature, not to mention how to maximize your ROI, it can be challenging to get started right. We recognize that our customers get the most out of our tools when we do our job of educating them on how to do just that. Here at Baremetrics, along with our metrics, we offer additional tools like customer segmentation, our customer insights platform, a SaaS forecasting tool, and our dunning solution, Recover. With so many solutions, making sure that any current or potential customers have the information they need to maximize return is a must. In this article, we’re going to walk you through one of our tools, Baremetrics Recover, and show you how to set it up. By the end, you’ll know exactly what you need to get started right and maximize returns using Recover.Baremetrics Recover is a one-stop shop dunning software developed by us. From customized email campaigns to in-depth analytics on recovery rates to in-app customer reminders, Recover provides you with the most in-depth dunning tool experience. But aside from the fact that we developed it, there are plenty of reasons to use Recover. For one, it’s integrated with the rest of our metrics, so you can get deeper insights than other dunning tools.For example, when viewing a customer’s profile, you’ll be able to see what plan they’re on, and a timeline of any failed charges, dunning emails sent, and more all in one place.Secondly, in the “performance” dashboard for Recover, you can scroll down and view the reasons why your customer’s credit cards are failing:And even a breakdown of how each dunning email performed (including how much revenue you recovered from each email):We believe that every SaaS & subscription business needs a dunning solution. Because the question shouldn’t be “why should we use a dunning solution?” rather “how much is it costing you every month, not using one?”.If you’re interested in giving Recover a try, you can get a 14-day free trial today.You decided to recover your customer’s failed charges on autopilot with Recover? Boom - you’re in.Now you may be thinking, “how should I use Recover to get the most money back?” Fair question.Our approach has been refined over the years now having hundreds of SaaS businesses using Recover. Apart from the basics of getting signed up, here are 3 tips for recovering the most failed payments using Baremetrics Recover.When emailing customers about failed payments, it always helps when that email looks familiar to the customer. Using Recover allows you to do so with a fully customizable email experience in three key ways: We encourage Recover users to update each email verbiage to further be in line with your company. Like below:To access, go to Recover → Settings → Emails → and click on the drop-down arrow next to each email template to add your own copy!Secondly, you’re able to customize the styling of the email by editing the HTML / CSS template.If you already have a stylized email in a tool you currently use (like Intercom or an email tool), you can likely reuse the same HTML. Be sure to look out for a few modifications and ensure that you include the {Content} parameter in the email.Here’s an example of our styled email once the HTML/CSS template has been modified:This is an example of a branded email form we send. The goal here is to help your customers feel like they're still in your company’s experience. Each email is meant to match everything from your verbiage and tone to brand and everything in between!The final way you can further customize your emails is by adding a call to action button.The simplest way is to include the {BillingLink} in each individual email template, which will give you something similar to what you see below:To get a call to action button, remove the {BillingLink} attribute from the individual templates and instead use the {BillingURL} attribute as part of an image or button link, like below:You can find all the code you’ll need in our help documents. Simply go to ‘collections’ → ‘Recover’ → ‘Customizing the global template’ (or for the sake of time, just go here).Recover’s performance is stepped up a notch when you embed it directly into your website. Prompting your customers on your website in addition to email will ensure you recover even more failed charges!You can get your unique embed script on the Billing Form page. Go to Recover in your dashboard → Settings → Credit card form. Once there scroll all the way down and your script will be there. Here’s how it all works:During the grace period, we float a reminder along the bottom of the page. The default grace period setting in Recover is 10 days. You can set the duration of the grace period, for instance, our team goes with 7 days. Also, be sure to customize the color and copy of the banner.Note that during the grace period, this banner won’t prevent your customers from using your app. After the grace period is over, your customers are presented with a credit card form and not allowed to use the app until they update their details. This is the same form that you configured earlier:Now comes the embed script. Load the embed script anywhere on your website that you would like it to appear.When embedding, leave everything as is except for the CUSTOMER_ID, which you should programmatically replace with each user's unique customer number given by your payment provider.By enabling this option, you can sign your request data with a secure token only known to your backend and Baremetrics. Once you start sending JWTs, our backend will no longer accept unsigned requests. One of the biggest mistakes you can make when using Baremetrics Recover is to send a single email and call it a day. DON’T do that and here’s why.People put things off, emails get overlooked and life happens. If you want to recover more revenue from failed payments, you have to be persistent.Just how many emails should you send? Turn on ALL of the emails under the \"delinquency\" section, emails day 0-30. We’ve analyzed over 1 million dunning emails sent by our customers with Baremetrics Recover, and here’s what we found:You can see the first email sent is the most effective (0 days = the email sent the day of the failed payment). But look at the following emails sent after that.Imagine if you only sent one email. No reminders, extra nudges, or last-ditch efforts to keep a customer using your product. All the customers who didn’t open or click your email or update their billing info would go unpaid until who knows when.This is one of the reasons we don’t recommend relying on out-of-the-box dunning emails from your payment processors (ie Stripe). With most of them, your emails are sent over the course of 7-14 days. And as you can see from our data above, expanding to 30 days allows you to recover A LOT more revenue.If you’re concerned about coming off as too pushy by sending multiple dunning emails, don’t be. Some customers need to be reminded multiple times before they'll take action.To turn ALL your emails on in your Recover settings, you’ll want to go to Recover → Settings → Emails → Content. Once there you will see all pre-written dunnings emails as below:But before you go…Now you’re good. 😉There you have it - all you need to know to maximize the best return using Baremetrics Recover. If you take action and follow best practices, Recover will single-handedly pay for your Baremetrics subscription and more. Again, the question shouldn’t be “why should we use a dunning solution?” rather “how much is it costing you every month, not using one?”.If we’re wrong and the recovered revenue doesn't at least pay for your entire Baremetrics account, we'll credit your team the next month! No commissions. No gimmicks. No hidden fees. We offer simple tiered pricing so you don't overpay for commission on the revenue that should be yours in the first place. Sounds too good to be true, fortunately for you, it isn’t! To start recovering failed payments for your business, sign up for Baremetrics Recover today.\n"

      "Stripe Reports: What Is and Isn’t Available.\n",
      "Stripe, Inc. (mostly referred to as Stripe) was founded in 2010. Stripe is a payment processing company but is also used to create reports. The company generates a lot of media buzz, mainly due to the involvement of its big-name investor Elon Musk. Close to 2 million websites use Stripe reports and the company holds a 18.54% market share in the payments processing category.Of course, media buzz alone shouldn’t convince you to use Stripe (or any other reporting and analytics platform). In this article, we’ll compare Stripe metrics and Stripe reporting to what we offer at Baremetrics. But don’t just take our word for it. Sign up for a 14-day free trial and see for yourself. Stripe is a payment processor with some financial reporting. But Baremetrics is the perfect software for you if you're looking to get more insight into your Stripe payments and business operations in general.For those who want to dig deeper into their Stripe reporting, Baremetrics is a great way to get more in-depth reports. In fact,  Baremetrics is best used with Stripe. To clarify, Stripe is a payment processor, with some financial reporting. Baremetrics, on the other hand, is a financial reporting tool built for Stripe integration. If you need more information than what your Stripe reports supplies, you can use Baremetrics to fill in the gaps and generate in-depth reports. Stripe can provide standard financial reports to reconcile transactions and activity in your account. There is a dashboard to view a summary, with the option to download it as an itemized account (in CSV format). Stripe has two main financial reporting tools: Balance and Payout Reconciliation. These tools help you create reports of your transaction history, payments.The Stripe Balance Report provides a CSV report of your transaction history and other custom data associated with those transaction. It's similar to a bank statement and useful for companies that use Stripe like a bank account to make manual payouts.You can use your Stripe Balance Report to reconcile your balance at the end of every month.If you enabled automatic payments and want to reconcile transactions settled in each payout, you will use this report. The Payment Reconciliation report matches payouts with batches of payments and other related transactions. There are two primary Stripe transaction reports, the Balance Report and the Payment Reconciliation Report. The Balance Report shows your itemised transaction history. It’s a CSV file that you can use in manual accounting.The Payment Reconciliation Report is a summary of your transactions within a specific date range.Stripe measures several metrics relevant to Saas businesses. The metrics are included under the Growth, Retention, Subscriber Information, Product and Collections Information categories.Stripe displays your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), MRR Growth, Net revenue, and New Subscribers for specific periods. You can also view your MRR per product and per plan, if relevant. The downside is that Stripe may include trial users in its MRR calculations, which could inflate your data. Stripe gives you access to your subscriber churn rate, churned revenue, and subscriber retention, and revenue retention by cohort.Use Stripe to view your Average Revenue per Subscriber (ARPS), Lifetime Value (LTV), Top Subscribers, and Recently Churned Subscribers. This allows companies to view Monthly Recurring Revenue by product or by service plan, depending on the nature of their business. Stripe will give you insight into Recovered Revenue and Outstanding Invoices. If you are technically adept and have a good understanding of data analytics, you can create custom reports that reveal data for charges, refunds, disputes, and others with Stripe Sigma. Sigma is a customizable SQL tool that allows users to write queries and track how metrics change over time. Anyone can create or edit a query via a template. Clients can generate a custom report detailing recurring revenues per month or per year, average revenue per customer, or even how many invoices remain unpaid. It’s an excellent tool for companies that do not like pre-packaged reports. You can download all your account activity grouped by month up to the last full day, including charges, refunds, fees, etc. You can go through this via the Stripe dashboard. Alternatively, you can filter and export all transactional data as a CSV or download a monthly report or QuickBooks-formatted export via your account’s business settings.Stripe has many excellent reporting features, and the dashboard displays essential information, but there are few blind spots in their reporting that you may want to supplement. MRR Growth Rate is a great metric, but manual forecasting isn’t easy. Stripe will display your MRR, but it won’t provide you with a revenue forecaster.You can view new and active subscriptions with a click of a button with Stripe reports, but you can’t drill down and distinguish between plan quantities, upgrades, downgrades, failed charges, or refunds with the same ease. As dunning management is a crucial part of your SaaS business, you may want to look for an additional automation tool that integrates directly with your reporting. You can view Churn Rates in Stripe (based on revenue), but it doesn’t display downgrades versus actual cancellations. You can see that customers are leaving, but not why they are churning. It’s tough to drill down into customer metrics and motivation. Stripe doesn’t make distinctions about customers using a trial version of your software solution. Stripe reports contain very little information about customers, and it’s not possible to augment information using third-party data. As a SaaS company, you might want deeper profiling information. Benchmarking helps companies gain an independent perspective about the company and how well they compare in terms of performance and delivery to the competition. Your benchmarks are a great sales tool when pitching to clients and investors. With Stripe, you cannot compare your Stripe metrics to other companies of your size and scope. Stripe doesn’t allow for granular segmentation, e.g., looking at churned customers cross-referenced with the plan they are using. This can make it difficult to gauge which strategies are working and which aren’t. Stripe provides basic reporting to help teams get started, but growing SaaS & subscription companies upgrade to Baremetrics for more depth, accuracy, and supplementary tools.Baremetrics has many reports similar to Stripe, but in addition to focusing on the current financial situation, Baremetrics also focuses on forecasting your company’s financial future. You can use Baremetrics’ templates to create multiple scenarios and even include variables that reflect the best and worst-case performance scenarios. You can also compare scenarios with actuals year after year to improve your accuracy and measure your KPIs.  Better financial reports enable better decision-making.With the Baremetrics toolkit, you can view more detailed data across customizable periods. Here are the tools that Baremetrics has that Stripe doesn’t. The Forecasting tool allows you to make informed predictions and projections about your company’s future, including MRR projections, cash flow projections, and customer projections. The Reporting tool  pulls data directly from Stripe or other payment processors and displays the information in easy-to-digest graphs and charts. Baremetrics tracks 26 essential SaaS metrics including Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Net Revenue, and more.You might also want to see summarized data in a quarterly or annual form instead of getting information overload for every day on your screen. After all, SaaS companies have many unique metrics and KPIs that can’t be communicated using only the three statement structure of the Operating Model.Your trials are valuable tools for conversion. Baremetrics allow you to measure how customers behave during their trial. Are they using all the features? Are they logging in every day? If not, a quick phone call might help them find success - and sign on once the trial ends! Your customers form the backbone of your success. Baremetrics offers profound insight into your customers, right from your financial reporting dashboards. You can view where your customers are located, their lifetime value, and their transactions. Baremetrics also allows you to segment those customers any way you want. Want a glance at how many customers have signed on in your home base? Or which customers canceled this week? You can, with the click of a button. Baremetrics also has automated recovery tools to help reduce churn and recover failed payments - all on the same platform!Stripe is great for showing you the basics about your data, but it's not enough to get a complete picture of what's going on. With Baremetrics, you'll see more in-depth information and have access to all the necessary metrics that can help with better decision making.Start forecasting, dive deep into customer data, and explore all your financial metrics in one place using Baremetrics.

      "Bookkeeping for Your SaaS Business.\n",
      "A bookkeeper is responsible for keeping accurate and up-to-date information on the financial health of your business.Although bookkeepers and accountants share some duties, for example preparing tax returns or producing the end of year financial statements, a bookkeeper’s main duty is keeping the basic, daily finances in order.This is usually accomplished with the double-entry system of accounting discussed below.When I first started my online B2B business, my “bookkeeping” consisted of keeping all invoices in a pickle jar along with an apology to my accountant every year.Not only did this mean a stressful April, but it also meant that I missed valid expenses, had no idea how much money I was spending day to day, and had no actionable data on my company that could be used for strategic planning. Obviously, I don’t recommend this, even if a gherkin is still a great snack.I was rescued (forcibly) by a banker. They told me bluntly that my “system” of bookkeeping would result in a denial of my bank loan in the short term and the potential for tax trouble in the long term.Afterall, well-maintained books are the only antidote to a tax audit.Along with recommendations for bookkeeping software packages available, my favorite advice from them was to take the receipts out of my pickle jar weekly, record all the information into a spreadsheet, write a number on the top of the receipt for easy cross-referencing and then stick the receipt in a photo album as back up.(Hint: use a code that includes letters indicating the type of expense, the date, and a number starting 0001 for ordering them during the year.)Of course, there are apps you can use to upload images of your receipts to keep all files digital, but I would discuss this with an accountant before discarding the original receipts.But what if you have too many receipts and invoices to be able to do that?That’s where Baremetrics comes in. If you are running a small business with subscription revenue, you can monitor all of your finances using Baremetrics.Wouldn’t something like this be great for your business?If you want to see your business metrics on an easy to use dashboard, sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and get started.Before we get into why you need bookkeeping, let’s look at some of the basic terminology used in bookkeeping. Regardless of whether you are thinking about taking a bookkeeping course, pursuing a bookkeeping job, or just want to organize your business, the following are terms that you will encounter regularly and should understand.Whether you take on the responsibility of bookkeeping yourself, contract bookkeeping services locally or online, or hire a bookkeeper to handle this work, there are numerous benefits bestowed on your company.Once you have your books in order and are comfortable with day-to-day bookkeeping, you can unlock the full potential of the information in those spreadsheets through data visualization.Finding hidden patterns in your sales, seeing the growth potential, and knowing which product is poised to be the star of your marketplace can all be done through using Baremetrics. Data collecting and collating are only the first steps, with data analytics being a necessary next stage to maximize sales and keep on top of those past due accounts receivable.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial, and start getting great metrics on your business’s transactions.\n",
      "5 Tips for Handling HR as a Start-Up.\n",
      "As a SaaS founder, a hundred tasks are bound to occupy your mind on a daily basis. We’re willing to bet that Human Resources isn’t one of them – but here’s why it should be.Few start-ups adopt an HR structure in their early stages. For a while they might function without one, especially if the founder is the company. There comes a point in any successful business, however, when it’s time to grow.Growth usually entails on-boarding new people, who will bring exciting fresh ideas and personalities to the table. For the cacophony of new voices to come together in harmony, they will need a guiding process and structure as scaffolding for the business you are building together.This process is not reserved for the corporate world; the earlier appropriate HR processes are implemented, the greater the chances are that the company’s vision will retain its integrity at scale.A common misconception about HR sees the department’s raison-d’etre as resolving problems and complaints, handling policy questions, renegotiating contracts and so forth. While these are some of its key tasks, this model is reduced to being merely reactive.In reality, the potential is far greater than that. Proactive HR seizes the opportunity to shape your company from the ground up, solidify its mission, and set the tone for the values and dynamics you hope to nurture.And if you need some extra help, Humareso is an award-winning global human resources consulting firm focusing on the strategic and tactical needs of organizations. Reach out to John Baldino for more info!By the way, we’re running a free trial here at Baremetrics at the moment. Nothing gives you more time to focus on things like HR than having a system for getting insights in your key business metrics. If you’re looking for in-depth metrics, sign up here.As holds true for most things, a problem avoided is better than a problem solved. Taking the time at the start to set down healthy boundaries, clarify roles and set positive expectations will undoubtedly help sidestep a plethora of interpersonal issues in the future.Adding a whole new task to your already-overflowing to-do list might seem daunting. But don’t worry. We've got you covered with these 5 Tips for Handling HR as a Start Up:It’s never too early to start building a Human Resources protocol.Whether you’re tackling HR internally or through an external consultant, there are great options available to help you navigate all stages of growth.Plan your hiring process long before adding people to the team. If you intend to ask for seed money, you will be required to pitch a 1-3 year business plan. For most companies, this plan will involve bringing on new people. Demonstrating a realistic grasp of the needs and financial liabilities of employees is crucial in gaining the trust of a third party.Proactivity and good organisation is also the key to avoid common hiring pitfalls that could lead to catastrophic consequences. More on that under Tip 3.You possess a unique opportunity, right at the birth of a start-up, to decide which values to cultivate. Your first hires in particular set the tone from that point on. Throughout the company’s growth, these first stage dynamics will be replicated at scale, along with any unresolved issues. First, focus on finding the right people for your company. In HR terms, this means identifying candidates who are of the right fabric but not necessarily an exact fit. In a small company, someone with a unique perspective is likely to contribute more meaningful ideas than someone who aligns perfectly with the rest of the team. So how do you find the right person?Second, treat the people you bring on board as assets who can transform your company.  No one wants to simply fill a gap. According to Lensa, broad interview questions such as ‘‘show me a project you’re proud of’’ are a great way to really get to know the person you’re considering.  An approach like this will help you see if they’d be the kind of asset your company is looking for. The more you invest in the people you hire, the more they will be invested in the success of your company!Third, hiring doesn’t necessarily equate with growth. Over-hiring can actually eat your growth. Before you bring someone new on board, ask yourself carefully whether you really need someone full time, or if a consulting arrangement might add more value.Be sure to check in with HR on your local employment regulations though – more on this with our next tip.Employment contracts are a minefield. The sooner you accept that “whatever ought to be right, probably isn’t”, the sooner you can get it done right.Few things run the risk of costing a company more than discovering that the terms of their contracts are unlawful. Every business needs a crystal clear understanding of what is legal in the place of hiring, or they could face hefty fines, back-pay on benefits, and even have assets frozen.When hiring abroad, assuming that your legal framework applies universally is an extremely costly mistake to make. Some common terms of American employment contracts are actually wholly illegal in many foreign countries.European employees, for instance, don’t work ‘at will’, and are entitled to severance pay. Little distinction is made between consultants and employees in terms of workers’ rights and benefits, unlike their stateside equivalents.Even within the US, state laws vary wildly, particularly in relation to 0-hour contracts.Let’s say you signed an agreement with a part-time consultant. Regardless of what the contract says, if a court deems that the de-facto work conditions determine that the consultant is actually an employee, that contractor is now entitled to full employee benefits.Legal and HR consulting not only keep track of the necessary hiring-and-firing paperwork, but also make sure that as a busy founder, you won’t make a potentially bankrupting-level mistake in the process.Hiring isn’t just about a company’s needs. It should equally consider what employees can gain under your employ. Joining a start-up is risky, offers less job security than large corporations, and usually includes fewer benefits. So why work for you?People who choose to join a start-up generally identify with the company’s ideals and objectives on a personal level. If you’re going to attract and retain the right people, you must speak compellingly about the company’s mission, vision, and values.Clear communication is also fundamental in establishing what the company expects from its employees. With fair boundaries set out unequivocally in the on-boarding paperwork, issues of poor work quality and rule-bending are far less likely to occur in the future.On the flipside, the company makes certain promises to employees. These must be honest, realistic and concrete. Ethereal or unrealistic promises about a distant future will only frustrate the people working for you, possibly compelling them to slack or quit. Stick to precise statements such as, ‘’I can promise health benefits in six months, but it’ll take two years before I can offer 401(k)’’, and deliver on those plans.As a founder, making grand and unrealistic promises will only add further stress to you in the long run. Keeping those commitments small, practical and delivered on in frequent intervals is a much better way to inspire trust and avoid burnout.If you need advice on what benefits you might realistically offer employees, consulting HR is a great place to start.Imagine this. Despite following these steps, somewhere along the way the wires got crossed. You have a disgruntled employee who is underperforming, or even threatening to leave the company entirely.First of all, breathe. It happens. And HR is there to help. As a start-up, you have the opportunity to really listen.The first reflex of a lot of founders is to either jump on the solution themselves, or want to coach the team on how to fix it.But when an employee is raising concerns, the resolution really comes in two parts: Let’s say an employee raises concerns about the upcoming pitch for seed money. The problem-oriented response would be to further develop the pitch by researching the competition, improve the presentation and so forth.Listening to the subtext could also reveal that this employee is concerned about their job security. The solution to this problem might have nothing to do with the pitch whatsoever, but rather with them questioning the longevity of their role in the company for instance.As a start-up, your team is your company – their success is your success, and vice versa. Developing trust and security through open conversations is fundamental to cultivating a positive work culture.And at the end of the day, that’s what Human Resources is all about: providing companies and employees the tools they need to achieve their highest potential together.If you're looking to take your company’s HR to the next level, reach out to John Baldino and the team at Humareso for a consultation today.For insights into your business metrics, check out the free Baremetrics trial here.\n"

      "Do Churn-Based LTV Calculations Mislead Us?.\n",
      "Lifetime Value (LTV) is one of the most important metrics we follow in SaaS. It tells us the value our customers bring to our business.We need it to make informed decisions about customer acquisition expenses. For example--we shouldn't spend more than we expect to earn. But how much do we gain? How accurate are our LTV estimates? Do our estimates get close to the real thing?Typically, LTV is estimated using a \"simple\" LTV calculation. It's ubiquitous in our industry: a simple but effective metric for estimating LTV. But is it really effective?In our previous post, we explored pitfalls in using \"churn\" metrics. We found that \"churn\" misleads us in some circumstances, such as when there are many short-term customers. Our most popular metric for LTV is a \"churn\"-based metric, where churn is in the denominator when calculating it. So what does that say about our LTV calculations? Are they wrong sometimes?In this post, we're going to test the \"simple\" LTV metric. When is it accurate? Where does it mislead us? How close does it get us to the actual LTV? Read on to find out.Notice that it includes \"churn\" in the denominator. That \"churn\" is the same metric we tested in our previous post.If churn misleads us for customer retention, does it also mislead us for lifetime value calculations? Let's investigate! As usual, we'll turn to simulations to answer the question. Let's run some simulations where we know the actual value for LTV and see how the \"simple\" method performs at estimating it.Let's simulate a simple business situation: a stagnant business, where nothing is changing. Sign-ups stay the same. Dropouts stay the same, and the average lifetime of a subscription does not change. Here's a summary:The graph below illustrates a simulation where we generate the data ourselves using known parameters (such as sign-up rates, subscription lifetimes). Since we created these features, we know the ground truth. We can evaluate our metrics, such as “simple” LTV, by comparing them against the truth.Here's a look at the active subscriber population in the simulation we described above:Notice how the population of active subscribers grows quickly over the first 20 months, then the population fluctuates above and below the red dotted line for the rest of the time in the simulation. After about 15 months, the business is truly stagnant. The purple active-subscribers line will hug the red dotted line forever, fluctuating at around 72 subscribers.The stagnant business scenario should be easy for an LTV metric to handle because nothing is changing. There should be plenty of data for the metric to capture the true LTV. But can our \"simple\" LTV metric approach the true LTV that we know? Let's calculate LTV each month in the time series above. We will begin with small amounts of data in the early months, but as our dataset grows, the estimate should get closer to the real LTV value. Does it?The chart above shows the simple LTV estimate calculated every month. The blue line indicates the actual lifetime value for this customer base. Notice that while the business is in its growth phase, our “simple” LTV underestimates the true LTV by a lot.Just to recap, we know the LTV in this simulated situation as we have chosen it. We then used the simple LTV metric to calculate LTV. Then, we compared the simple LTV metric and the LTV metric that is a parameter of the simulation to see if they were the same or not.The simple LTV starts near zero. It starts small because the customer population hasn't stabilized yet, and many short-term customers are dropping out relative to the rest of the customers.The simple LTV is much closer to the real thing when the population stabilizes, but we still tend to underestimate LTV. The average LTV estimate when the population stabilizes is $32. That's 20% less than the true value, $40. It's an underestimate, but surprisingly, it isn't terrible! While not perfect, simple LTV calculations in the above scenario seem usable, being only about 20% off.But how does the \"simple\" LTV calculation fare in a more typical Baremetrics user's customer base, where customers subscribe for an average of a few years?What if we tried the simulation with a different customer base? Would we still get under-estimates? Let's try a new simulation with fewer short-term subscribers. Would our LTV estimate be any better?The graph below represents a different simulation. The parameters are the same as before, except for a different distribution of subscribers. This population closely resembles an actual Baremetrics customer. In this simulation, there are fewer short-term subscribers, and the average subscription lifetime is 3.7 years. If the average subscription lasts for 3.7 years, then the actual LTV must be $904.This is calculated by doing 3.7 years * 12 months * $20 per month.Can \"simple\" LTV get close to that $904 number?In the above chart, the yellow line represents the simple LTV calculation, calculated each month as the simulation progresses. Notice that we get dramatic over-estimates at the beginning. Why is this? It's because we have more longer-term subscribers. In the early months of this process, very few of the customers are dropping out. As a result, our estimate for LTV is much too high because our estimates expect the subscriptions to last forever with such a low drop-out rate. The customer population stabilizes after 3.7 years, however. After 3.7 years, we get estimates close to the actual LTV (blue line). What's more, it appears as a much more accurate estimate than in our previous scenario. It's off by only a few percentage points!So as a verdict, \"simple\" LTV is not so bad in the case where customers stay long-term, and nothing is fundamentally changing in the business! Especially considering the issues, we discussed in our previous post about churn.Let's try another simulation to explore this issue further. Let's keep everything the same as the scenario we did above, but with one difference:Suppose we have a great marketing team that steadily increases the number of sign-ups each month.Let's suppose that each month, our average sign-up rate goes up by one percent.After 100 months, we should be getting double the customers on average each day. The lifetime value, however, doesn't change. Does this extreme growth ruin our LTV estimate?Here is a chart of the active customer base:In the above chart, we see how \"simple\" LTV estimates (yellow) take longer to converge with the true value for LTV (dotted line).The estimates do eventually converge with the true value, but only after about ten years. Even five years into this time series, our LTV estimates are off by as much as 50%. It appears the \"simple\" LTV estimate is sensitive to a changing customer population, even though the customer population size should have nothing to do with the lifetime value of the individual.This sensitivity to population size is because the simple LTV estimate depends on churn, and churn is sensitive to a rapidly changing population size. Can we find a better metric for LTV? One that doesn't get distorted by changing sign-up rates? Instead of the simple LTV estimate, let's build one based on statistics.How about this: we estimate the average lifetime of a customer using a statistical model. We'll build a statistical model for subscription durations using our data.We'll be using Weibull regression as our statistical model. We feed data into the model, and it will spit out an estimate for the average subscription lifetime.Then we multiply the average subscription lifetime by our monthly rate of $20/month to obtain an LTV estimate. How would such an estimate compare with \"simple\" LTV?Let's repeat the previous simulation with growing customer sign-up rates and calculate the LTV both ways to compare.An interesting side-note: Notice how at the beginning of the above chart, the churn-based estimate over-estimates the actual LTV, whereas the statistical method underestimates it. Why? Both of these distortions happen because these estimates are naive. They don't know anything before seeing data, so they begin with absurd estimates: the statistical estimate starts at zero, and \"simple\" churn starts near infinity. Can we improve our estimates by giving them a better starting point before they see any data? Yes! It turns out we can improve our statistical estimate by giving the model some education. Suppose the model starts with a vague idea of what an average subscription lifetime looks like, based on previous experiences or experiences of peers. Let's say we expect a subscription lifetime to last about a year. A wide ball-park guess, but more realistic than zero. Then as the data rolls in, we update our estimates. As we collect more data, our vague starting point will steadily disappear, giving way to whatever the data tells us. But in the beginning, it will help by starting closer to the truth.What we are doing is called regularization in statistics and machine learning. It's a technique where we add bias to our model--the good kind of bias. It puts more weight on realistic data points, and it treats extreme observations with skepticism. We get better estimates as a result.In the above chart, we’ve added an improved statistical estimate (green). Notice how the new estimate outperforms the other estimates in the first few months. This improvement does exactly what we intended.Our improved estimate is closer to the real LTV value in the early months. As the data rolls in, however, the two statistical estimates converge, eventually becoming indistinguishable.Hopefully, we have shown that it is possible to find better LTV metrics than churn-based ones. Churn-based LTV estimates can be highly inaccurate, especially when there is little data. We can replace it with these better metrics. Further, we can also fine-tune them, so they are better suited for our field in SaaS.\n"

      "How To Lead A Hybrid Team Post Covid.\n",
      "Workplaces have been slowly moving towards a flexible model for some time now. This is especially the case in the SaaS world. Just a few years ago, nearly half of workers were already working from home some of the time. Due to the pandemic and government lockdowns, companies were made to pivot to remote-only very quickly. Now, many organizations are working on plans to build hybrid workplaces that won’t hurt productivity or employee engagement but will give employees the flexibility they demand. Leaders will need to adjust their way of thinking about managing and teamwork to lead a hybrid team successfully in a post-pandemic world. In this article we’ll discuss what a hybrid team is, some pros and cons of a hybrid workforce, and share four tips for all leaders looking to make the shift for good.Let's go!If you lead a hybrid team, our bet is you’ll need the right tools to be successful. Especially with monitoring your metrics. That’s where Baremetrics comes in. Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues now.Traditionally, workplaces have expected employees to conduct work activities together from a central location. For the past year and a half, employees have been working from home or remotely rather than that central office location. A hybrid team is one that is flexible and offers employees the choice of working from the office or remotely. The theory is that hybrid workplaces offer the best of both worlds between remote and in-office. There are, however, nuances to hybrid workplaces so it’s important to disguise the benefits and drawbacks.Researchers have found that workers who were forced into remote situations due to the pandemic are interested in continuing to have flexible hours. Gartner found that 70 percent of customer service employees hope to have work-from-home options in the post-pandemic world.  Another survey found that nine out of 10 businesses have plans for a hybrid workplace.Clearly there is a lot of interest among employees to have a bit of both moving forward. Having a hybrid workforce can have several benefits, such as:There’s no blueprint for leaders on how to effectively manage a hybrid team or workplace. We’re in a trial and error phase and there are still kinks to be worked out before best practices have been established. For this reason, you’ve probably seen the headlines of Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, calling remote work an “aberration” and not conducive to productive work. Companies want to go back to the way it was because they knew it worked. But the trend to hybrid work continues to rise so leaders that want to get ahead need to know how to lead hybrid teams.Here are some ways that managers can successfully lead hybrid teams.McKinsey defines inclusion in the workplace as “the degree to which an individual feels that their authentic selves are welcomed at work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner.” Building an inclusive workplace is paramount to leading hybrid workplaces. Employees, wherever they are, need to feel like they’re on a level playing field. They need to know they have a voice and are heard by their leaders. Without it, productivity will plummet and employees will leave.How can we build inclusive hybrid workplaces? We can start with practical things like having everyone on team meetings use Zoom even if some are in the same office together. It also includes higher-level initiatives like making sure your workplace doesn’t favor in-office employees over remote ones, by making use of a cloud-based service desk software that employees go to seek help internally with IT systems, HR questions, or other business issues.A Stanford study found that even though people working from home were 13% more productive, they didn’t receive promotions as often as their in-office colleagues. It’s a case of “out of sight, out of mind.”An interesting and effective example of how companies are building inclusive workplaces is through mentoring programs:Hybrid work relies on flexible working arrangements.Lynda Gratton, a professor of management practice at London Business School created an axis that charts how workplaces are experimenting with flexibility in either place or time in their workplace. The image below shows the constraints and benefits of various hybrid models. Between now and when companies find out what works best, embrace flexibility and give employees the autonomy to get their work done regardless of when and where. One company that is finding creative ways to embrace a hybrid workplace is Wex, a payment solutions provider. Their VP of human resources, Sherry Olsen shared with Webex’s Future of Work column that they’re changing their offices to be more about collaboration. By making the office a place for camaraderie and connection, employees are more open to coming back to the office. In her words, “[t]hey want to be connected, and be flexible.”In a hybrid working model, it can be easy to set priorities or objectives with remote employees and forget about checking in with them. Having 1:1 meetings that aren’t about immediate work can refresh employees and remind them that they’re part of a team and their work is valued. Sometimes this is best done by someone who isn’t their immediate manager because conversations can easily revert back to the work at hand. Providing mentoring opportunities - by either connecting them with more experienced employees or peer-to-peer learning - can create space for conversations not directly related to the day-to-day objectives. We spoke with two managers at a famous gallery in Dublin about their mentoring relationship. When speaking with the mentee, they shared how they felt about connecting with another colleague outside of a direct work project:Appreciation and acknowledgment are essential for employees to feel valued at work. Traditionally recognition has come in the form of raises, bonuses, and paid time off. But those are not the only way to say thank you to staff. Handwritten notes and cards, gifts, and praise in front of co-workers can also make an employee feel appreciated. Managers of hybrid teams will need to be encouraged to recognize the hard work of their hybrid team members. Without some acknowledgment, employees may start looking for employment elsewhere to feel valued. Having a strong culture is essential for hybrid workplaces, and it begins with small things like genuine recognition for a job well done. As a leader of a hybrid team, what are some ways you can make your employees feel valued? Here are three ways:1. Start a “small wins” Slack or Teams channel. You should actively look for opportunities to openly praise employees. And not just when it’s a big achievement. A dedicated space to recognize the “small wins” keeps things casual and gives you an opportunity to recognize exemplary behaviour. 2. Connect them with executives. We know that remote employees can feel isolated. Make them feel more part of something bigger by connecting them with a role model in the organization they wouldn’t normally work with. Give them resources to have conversations that are focused on their goals and ambitions.3. Share with them the recognition they get from others. Go to the managers of high potential remote employees. Ask them to share some strengths or recent wins they’ve had. Take what their manager shares with you and connect with them individually to congratulate them or recognize their hard work. When done in a 1-on-1 setting it can mean a lot to them to hear praise directly from a CEO or executive. It shows them that their manager is clearly sharing positive feedback about them to you.Hybrid workplaces aren’t something to “deal with.” They’re something to embrace. Today’s world presents a great opportunity for leaders to lean into what top talent is demanding - more flexibility - while also getting more productivity from them. Let’s be real though - the underlying challenge that hybrid teams face is fostering connection and combating feelings of isolation. The best way leaders can do this is through mentoring programs. Mentoring programs connect colleagues across departments and teams to encourage conversations that lead to professional development and growth. We saw above how Avison Young and New York Life both run internal mentoring programs to support DE&I initiatives. But many companies from all industries - from tech companies like Airbnb, to retail brands like 7-11, to consulting firms like Randstad - use mentoring for a myriad of objectives. Companies use mentoring to:Encouraging mentoring relationships among employees is good for them and for the business. Research has shown that employees who are mentored have a better career track than those who don’t. Likewise, employees who receive mentoring are more engaged. Starting a remote mentoring program is critical for hybrid employees to feel connected and continue to grow.If you lead a hybrid team, our bet is you’ll need the right tools to be successful.

      "Managing Total Expenses: A How To Guide.\n",
      "Business owners are constantly thinking about company finances.How do I maximize my company’s profit margin? Should I spend more on advertising or research? Is my business growth sustainable long term?The answers to all three questions can be found between the lines of your expenses. This article will cover what expenses you should track, and how you can calculate and manage them over time.While you’re here, you should try Baremetrics to view your subscription data and financial metrics in real-time, all in one place. Start a free trial today.A company’s total expenses is the sum of all costs spent towards running that business.Salaries, web hosting fees, transportation, software subscriptions, equipment purchases, hardware repairs, advertising fees etc are just some of the types of costs that compose a SaaS company’s expenses.Total Expenses are also one of the key metrics for growth analytics.Haven’t been keeping track? Not to worry.Here is a simple way to calculate your total expenses from income, revenue and equity.For example, a company’s equity grows from $100,000 to $1,000,000. The Net Income is therefore $900,000. Its recorded Total Revenue is $1,500,000. The Total Expenses must have amounted to $600,000.While this is a useful formula to reverse engineer your total expenses, keeping a detailed breakdown of expenses as you go is an invaluable management tool for your business that can help cut costs, project growth, and inform budget decisions.A small web development company grows their revenue from $4000 MRR (monthly recurring revenue) to $7000. From revenue alone, the company appears to have nearly doubled its profit.However, expanding the customer base has generated increased advertising, research and hardware costs. This raises the total monthly expenses from $3000 to $6000. The company’s net income has therefore remained the same at a monthly $1000.In addition, their Cost Revenue ratio has actually worsened from 75% to 85%, rendering the company less attractive to business partners and investors.Based on this information, the founder might choose to scale back and focus on their initial niche customer base, rather than continue to spend extra money and effort only to make the same net income.Secondly, some expenses are fully or partially tax deductible. With accurate tracking, a business is able to profit from tax deductions and benefits, and potentially even move to a lower tax bracket entirely.There are two major methods of tracking expenses. The first is based on regularity, and separates into fixed, recurring, non-recurring and extraordinary. The second categorises expenses by type.Fixed expenses are the standard charges that occur, as a rule, monthly on a determined date for a determined amount, such as the internet bill or rent.Recurring expenses are not standard in time and value, but still constitute fairly regular costs appearing on your balance sheet. Office supplies, business lunches and sundries are examples of recurring expenses.Non-recurring expenses are unpredictable, yet often inevitable expenses, such as unscheduled system maintenance and surplus phone charges.Extraordinary expenses are the disaster scenario costs that hit out of the blue. Flooding, medical emergencies or uninsured law suits are examples of this.So why categorise expenses based on regularity? Well, regular also means predictable. There is no better way to estimate future spending than basing it on past spending.Separating expenses by regularity makes it easier to project your business’s costs in the short, medium and long term.This method can also help flush out hidden costs like the software subscription trial you forgot to cancel.Finally, based on this model you might decide to keep separate expense accounts, notably an emergency fund for extraordinary expenses. Not only does this help in budgeting, but also creates better projections.A software engineer running their own One Person Company has a critical hardware failure. A last-minute replacement plus labour and emergency data recovery costs them $12000.This lowers their annual profit by 10% compared to last year, and a projection of the company’s future success would take into account this negative growth.As this cost is exceptional, however, it should not be taken into account for future projections. Keeping a separate expenses account ensures a more accurate cost model can be made.Another method of categorising expenses is by type: Sales & Marketing (S&M), General & Admin (G&A), and Research & Development (R&D). A key reason for separating expenses by type is to determine the spread of a company’s spending, and compare those ratios to competitors.By using this method, a data management company might discover they are spending a percentage twice as much on marketing as their competitors, but only half on R&D. This may leave them open to being overtaken by a newer but more research hungry competitor in the near future.An expense list itemised by amount and category also underpins a company’s ability to effectively allocate budgets to its different departments in the future.Quickbooks Online is a great tool for tracking expenses using this method. We even made an easy-to-follow guide!To get the most out of your data, you’ll also need a service that tracks your company earnings. Baremetrics monitors 26 key business metrics with flexibility to customize and organize them in a way that makes the most sense for your unique needs. Start a free trial today.A Total Expense Ratio (TER) compares a company’s costs to its equity, expressed as a percentage, based on the following formula:The lower the percentage, the lower the proportional cost is to run that business.This ratio isn’t just static – it also allows a company to track their performance over time.A large project management company expands its client base. After one year, this results in a significant increase in both the business’ equity, and its costs. Tracking the TER is crucial in order to determine whether the increase in expenses is proportional. Ideally, the TER should decrease over time as the business becomes more efficient.This is an invaluable benchmark not only to use internally, but can also compare performance to competitors. If your company’s TER is much higher than a competitor of similar scale in the same field, chances are that you are overspending on expenses.TER is equally a key metric for third parties considering investing in your business. If the TER fluctuates significantly, this could signal volatility in the business and be determined as an investment risk.Whether you use dedicated software or manage your own spending, it’s vital that your company manages expenses efficiently.If you have the accounting resources available, you might try the Zero Based Budgeting method (ZBB). The principal of ZBB is to consciously allocate every dollar towards one of the company’s set goals. These goals should be reassessed on a regular basis to make sure each cost is necessary and useful.Another method to eliminate unnecessary spending simply requires a set of highlighters. Print out the company’s monthly credit card statement, and identify each charge. Different colours can be used for different categories such as marketing, overhead, and development, and tallied in a spreadsheet for an overview of where exactly your money is going. This process will also help identify mistaken charges such as a double-booked hotel room or a card payment being deducted twice.Dedicated phone applications are a great way to track your cash expenses when you’re out and about. Some bookkeeping software will even integrate directly with your apps.No matter which method you choose, there’s no excuse not to track your total expenses. The information you can gather will be invaluable to your business: create smarter budgets, see more accurate projections, eliminate unnecessary costs etc. Time spent managing expenses will pay for itself.If you’re growing a SaaS or subscription business, you should be using Baremetrics.

      "Customer Segmentation Examples: How to do Customer Segmentation with Baremetrics.\n",
      "Lies, damned lies, and statistics. It’s no secret that numbers can be wildly misleading, and business metrics are no exception.Yes, metrics are absolutely the most accurate and reliable tools for understanding the financial health of your business. And yes, the numbers are exactly what you should be looking at for leads on how to grow your company. As long as they are the right numbers.Here is where customer segmentation comes in.Customer segmentation breaks down metrics into smaller subsets of data. Instead of looking at broad averages, segmented metrics get really specific in dissecting customer behaviour.Even larger businesses might think that aggregate data on MRR or churn is reliable enough to monitor your business growth.But consider this:Australia experiences both extreme droughts and extreme floods, but you’d never know that from looking at its average annual rainfall of 450mm of rain per year. Upon seeing this average amount, an umbrella manufacturer might decide to skip on the Australian market, and miss a huge business opportunity in Tasmania where it rains 237 days per year. The point is that, by only looking at averages, you might be missing something big, like a secret cash cow or massive budget waster. This article will explain how customer segmentation can help reveal where your business is succeeding, and which products are simply draining resources and slowing you down. We’ll walk through three real-life examples of customer segmentation using Baremetrics data and tools. Baremetrics helps SaaS and subscription companies get the most out of their data. Start a free trial today.For our first example, we’ll look at Baremetrics’ actual Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), a metric that shows your recurring revenue normalized into a monthly amount.Baremetrics is a medium-sized SaaS company. Here is the graph of our average MRR. This graph shows a 20% increase in MRR over the course of one year. But, the problem with analyzing growth based on this data alone is that the MRR shown is an aggregate for all plans. In other words, it averages MRR across all plans that this company offers. If some products are doing much better than others, this aggregate data won’t immediately reveal it. Here is MRR again, but broken down into two segments: Keeping in mind that Baremetrics charges customers based on their MRR, this second graph shows that Baremetrics makes more of its MRR from larger companies.What actions could we take based on this data? Our options include:Additional customer segmentation by geographical region or client type can also reveal sections of the market that are receptive to the product, but have as of yet remained largely untapped by that business.Based on this data, sales and R&D resources reallocated from the low-tier subscriptions can now target this new customer base with a high chance of success. The information gleaned by segmenting MRR metrics in this way provides a reliable roadmap to growth.For the next example, we’ll look at what segmentation tells us about customer churn patterns.Here are some empirical observations we’ve recorded:From here, what we need to know is: why are our customers churning? To start, we decided to take a deep dive into our own data to find out who is churning. If we could find a correlation between the customers cancelling their subscriptions, we could potentially adapt our product to offer them something worth staying for.To do this, we created a segment that compared customers using our Recover tool with customers who aren’t.Before we dive in, let me briefly explain what Recover does, and why it’s such a useful tool for subscription-based companies. Recover is an automated dunning solution that helps teams earn back revenue lost due to failed payments. Failed payments are a huge issue for SaaS and subscription businesses because the subscription model involves charging customers on a regular, usually monthly, basis.And when a client’s credit card expires, or their account runs out of funds, their payments stop. Suddenly, their subscription has expired and you’ve lost a customer. All because of inertia. Even if the customer knows that their card will expire soon, too often they put off doing anything about it because the process requires time and effort.Especially for smaller companies operating without a dedicated accounting team, the task of opening an email, logging in to an account, and clicking through a website to update payment information is a process that is likely to be put off again and again until it’s too late. In the meantime, your SaaS company is losing that revenue.Recover completely automates the dunning process so neither you nor your customers have to worry about losing money for preventable reasons. It works by automating customizable email campaigns, in-app reminders and paywalls, credit card capture forms, and in-depth analytics. Recover’s effectiveness and positive impact on our MRR is shown clearly above. In fact, by looking at the graph we can say that our customers using this product are far less likely to leave Baremetrics. In other words, Recover is an amazing tool that we need to encourage more customers to use through marketing efforts like free trials, and more. Speaking of free trials, here’s ours! As we were diving into churn patterns, we noticed something else. There was a really high incidence of customers churning at the 3 month mark. Here is a graph showing MRR from our Canadian customers. As a test, in April we offered a three month package subscription plan. You can see the graph spike in early April. Three months later, these subscriptions ran out and were not renewed, as seen by the drop in early July.What this told us was that customers who purchased a three month long subscription were unlikely to renew. The most likely explanation is that the majority of these customers were start-ups and smaller companies, who were looking for short term insights but were unable or unwilling to invest in monitoring their metrics longer term.We weren’t making much revenue off these three month plans, so we decided to scrap them. Instead, we’d offer a minimum subscription for six months. Even if we only got half the customers, we’d have the same revenue, with fewer sign-up and cancellation costs on our end.Many of the businesses who opted for the three month minimum subscription would in fact sign up for the six month period, as they still required insights into their metrics and simply wanted the cheapest of our provided options to do so. For us as a business it was an important insight to know that our product, even when used as a one-off, was worth double its original pricing to many of our customers.For our last example, let’s look at what customer segmentation can tell us about account upgrades.  The graph below tracks the quantity of customer upgrades over a six month period. Between February 5 and 16, we saw a spike of 50 upgrades. We want to know which customers are most likely to do this. Other than showing that two days in particular triggered a high number of upgrades, this aggregate data doesn’t reveal much about the customers prone to move to a higher tier plan.We then decided to drill down into the upgrade metric by segment in order to gain insights on its customer behaviour, as seen in the following graph.Segmenting customers by type reveals that Stripe customers are vastly more likely to upgrade than Shopify, Braintree or Apple users. With this data, we can now decide whether to mainly target Stripe customers, or to invest in better cross-platform compatibility for Apple, Braintree and Shopify users to make their own service more attractive to these types of consumers.Customer segmentation usually involves taking a single qualifying piece of information, for instance, customers based in Canada, and showing data for that subset. The onus falls on the user to try and extract meaningful insights within that data.In Baremetrics, customer segmentation is done by metric. This means you can select from over 26 metrics calculated in our app, and then segment it by customer attributes. There is enormous flexibility in how to mine your data to suit your business needs, whether you want to analyze churn by feature, MRR by geography, LTV by plan, etc. Baremetrics allows you to get granular about your segmentation without requiring advanced numeracy or statistical analysis training. Without the option to segment customer data, key metrics are presented merely in averages, and cannot provide the crucial insights needed to plan your next steps.If you’d like to see for yourself what you can learn about your customer patterns by using Baremetrics, check out the free trial.\n"

      "Understanding Failed Payments in Your SaaS Business.\n",
      "Failed payments in SaaS can be a real issue for both the customers and your company. Anyone tasked with understanding why payments decline or fail knows their work is cut out for them. The amount of financial information to be followed is so disparate; it can seem like one is going round in circles most of the time.With Baremetrics, the nightmare of not understanding why declined or failed charges happen is one that can be avoided. Baremetrics monitors subscription revenue for businesses by integrating directly with your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and pulls information about your customers and their behavior into a crystal-clear dashboard. From there you can get insights into your all failed payments using our dunning tool, Baremetrics Recover.  Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more into your subscription revenues today.When payments fail, the chances of that customer churning and not coming back drastically increases. Why does it happen in the first place?Here are 7 reasons why your customer’s credit cards fail in the first place:While developing a payment system API, it’s advised to complete several test runs to make sure all kinds of bugs are identified early on. The reason being when API codes are not positioned to handle possible payment errors, your customers' payments will often fail.An example of this would be when one of your customers is trying to make a purchase on your website and their network connection isn’t strong enough. That unstable connection can prevent an accurate recall of their profile data from your company servers. This results in a failed payment due to an invalid API call.If your company uses a payment provider like Stripe, be sure to include lines of code that can anticipate these kinds of errors.You can do so by prompting your customer to initiate another credit card transaction or online payment.Card issuers (commercial banks or other financial institutions) have automated systems that consider charges sent to them from SaaS companies like yours for authorization or decline. Depending on the payment system your SaaS company uses, information relays on the reasons for cards declined by the issuer can be extensive.On their end, card issuers consider and analyze pieces of information about your customer, such as account balance, spending habits, CVV, among others, before an authorization is made. In the case of a decline, the card issuer may provide helpful information on why the payment was declined. However, most declined payments by card issuers are categorized as “generic” and without any more specific information.A transaction is never approved when the card in use has expired or been deactivated. This is one of the more common reasons why credit card payments fail.Credit limits or insufficient account balances are another reason for declined payments and failed charges. Once a purchase exceeds the credit limit, the payment may be declined. When this happens, simply reach out to your customer to notify them that their credit card failed due to a low balance.It’s easy to see from the reasons as mentioned above that the problem isn’t always coming from the payment company.Conveying the right information to your customer at the right time can make all the difference when there is a declined payment or failed charge. We’ve found that up to 9% of your monthly recurring revenue is at risk each time a payment fails. Signing up for the Baremetrics Recover tool brings you a step closer to solving this problem of failing payments for good. Here’s are 4 ways you can get started today:1. Expiry Date Reminders:Sending reminders for expiry dates that are just around the corner can alert your customers before a failed payment occurs. When these reminders (email, text, or push notifications) are in place, the chances your customers use an expired card is greatly reduced.2. Notifying of Out-of-Range Payments:Given the global reach of your SaaS company, some of your customers will be processing payments from countries that are considered out-of-range. Such transactions are likely to fail as a security measure initiated by the forgeign bank. Informing your customers that their country may be out-of-range can prompt proactive action on the part of the customer.3. Identify card or financial restrictions:Similar to situations in out-of-range countries, some cards contain structural restrictions (e.g., FSA/HSA cards for healthcare products and services) or functional restrictions (international card payments must not exceed $100). When customers are prompted to try different means of payment before the fact, the chances their credit card fails is less likely.4. Identify CVC or AVS failed checks:Due to network errors, the security checks on CVV or AVS codes may not be successful the first time around. Resolving this issue when it happens can ensure the next try will be successful. If the country where the card is issued differs from the client’s current IP address, it can be ruled as a potentially fraudulent transaction.When you know why a customer’s credit card is failing, it becomes easier to reach out to your customers with the right kind of information to enable successful payments the next time.Staying on top of customers' failed payments is a painful, yet necessary evil of all SaaS businesses. Since the bulk of your churn comes from involuntary churn (credit card failures), having a process in place to ensure you don’t leave any money on the table is a must. Below are three ways to monitor failed payments based on what works best here at Baremetrics: You can tell the efficiency of a payment system by how seamlessly it integrates with your checkout page. Stripe, as an example, allows you to start accepting payments with a few lines of code. The smart payments system works seamlessly across devices and includes support for different payment types (recurring or one-time payments) and payment authentication.Braintree provides optimized processing from day one. They leverage strong communication among payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) to achieve seamless payments processing on the first attempt.When your payment system can automatically show you what payments have declined or failed, it arms you with the correct information to follow up with your customers. When a payment fails, simply send a quick email to your customer with the necessary steps to update payment details. If their card details have expired or their current IP address or postal code no longer matches the information held by the card issuer, you can prompt them to update this specific information as they may not be aware. Where the customer should visit their bank (e.g., when they need to request for a new card), it is helpful to indicate this in a customer support email.The more information your customer has about getting their payments right the next time, the higher the chances they will try again.3. Integrate an automated Dunning solutionIf your SaaS company wants to get in front of declined payments and failed charges, using a top payment system and a dunning solution is a must. When using a payment provider like Stripe, take it a step further and get the most out of monitoring your failed payments with Baremetrics Recover. Recover provides a combination of tools to help you combat failed payments with customizable email campaigns, in-app reminders and paywalls, credit card capture forms, and in-depth analytics to track everything along the way.The best part?

      "What is Net Sales Revenue: Net Revenue vs. Net Sales Revenue.\n",
      "We’re here to tell you that all revenue is good revenue. But there are nuances that you need to know when operating your SaaS business when it comes to revenue. Those nuances come into play when understanding the different types of revenue in your SaaS business.In this article, we’re going to define the types of revenue from NET revenue to Net Sales revenue, what is sales and look at how Baremetrics helps measure your revenue metrics.Revenue is the money earned by a business due to sales, inbound assets, or even paying out on an investment.While revenue may be used to account for a business's sales, it may also include money from other sources. Additionally, revenue can be recorded as gross and net revenue for a company, similar to how sales are tracked. Before going into revenue and sales, it's necessary to understand how these measures are calculated. Many platforms calculate revenue metrics, most don’t offer you the deep insights into your business like Baremetrics does. Baremetrics is a business metrics platform that calculates 26 key performance indicators for your company, including MRR, ARR, LTV, and total customers.As Baremetrics connects directly with your payment systems, your data is immediately fed into the your dashboard. Sign up for a free trial and begin accurately and efficiently tracking your subscription income.The following are some of the most common revenue streams:Gross revenue is the actual money generated by a company, including sales and non-operating income, before any deductions or cost reductions are made. Net revenue is a company's net income after all expenditures, such as the cost of goods sold and overhead, are deducted (rent, utilities, or payroll). This category includes all expenditures directly connected to sales activities and obligations for payments, rent or mortgage, utilities, and other overhead costs associated with the firm’s running.It's worth noting that, although gross and net sales may be computed similarly, the valuation of a business's sales usually excludes non-operational income such as interest or investment earnings, contributions, and other sources of income.The total income of a business may also include non-operating revenue sources. Types of non-operating revenue sources may include:While sales formulae are usually similar, calculating gross and net revenue considers all incoming and outgoing cash flow, not only the cash flow generated by a business's sales.Gross sales are the total income generated by a company minus the total cost of items sold directly associated with manufacturing or otherwise providing its services and products. Gross sales may also determine total revenue, hence why sales are a subset of revenue for a business.After deducting all costs of products sold and operational expenditures, net sales is the worth of a business's entire sales profit. This value is a critical financial metric for determining a business's sales profitability, as it indicates how lucrative and in-demand a company's goods and services are.It is critical to remember that sales profitability, or the gross profit margins of a company, may only provide insight into the profitability of the business's goods or services. In comparison, total revenue offers insight into a business's overall financial health.You can monitor your monthly revenue. You can split it according to a client’s location, plan type, and other criteria. You may create objectives, modify existing goals, and keep track of particular dates when a new product was released. You can even view your notes directly on the graphs to keep a close eye on the state of your company. You can calculate the MRR using the Baremetrics tool.This statistic forecasts your current revenue over the next 12 months. It is based on the assumption that nothing should change in the next year. It is predicated on the assumption of no new clients, no churn, and no additions. While this is an improbable scenario, the measure itself assists company leaders in considering the one-year horizon. The ARR can be calculated using the Baremetrics tool.This statistic indicates the amount of money collected daily. Net Revenue is calculated as Gross Volume (both recurring and non-recurring) minus Refunds. The Net Revenue can be calculated using the Baremetrics tool.This statistic is simply the percentage change in monthly revenue generated from one month to the next. It may be computed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, as well as annually. You can utilize the Baremetrics tool to determine the MRR.This statistic includes all one-time expenses that your company incurs. For instance, use fees, overages, and any other payments not associated with a subscription. The Baremetrics client may manually enter this data through the Baremetrics API. The other sources of revenue can be evaluated using the Baremetrics tool.When doing business, it’s critical to understand financial concepts that contribute to your company’s success. The reason being these metrics reflect the company's financial growth. Investors analyze financial key performance indicators (KPIs) of various businesses to decide which is the best investment. Internally, businesses utilize financial indicators to assess potential investments and monitor internal financial performance.To remain viable, businesses must recognize the value that these indicators provide and understand where they stand as a company. When you identify the areas that need improvement, any changes made in your company will (more than likely) come from insights into key metrics.Our suggestion? Use a tool like Baremetrics to track your subscription and bring you detailed-insights to grow your company. Baremetrics can connect straight to your payment gateway, such as Stripe, and gather data about your customers and their behavior into a clear dashboard.Dunning, 26 metrics, engagement tools, and customer analytics are all available via Baremetrics. MRR, ARR, LTV, total number of customers, total expenditures, and quick ratio are just a few of Baremetrics measures’ indicators.\n"

      "How to Build a SaaS Customer Acquisition Strategy.\n",
      "Acquiring customers for SaaS is a completely different ball game altogether than, say, for the traditional business models (think: eCommerce, for instance). In the SaaS industry, acquiring new leads through short-term marketing promotions will not cut it--which works as a killer strategy for the eCommerce business model. So what works (and doesn’t work) as a SaaS acquisition strategy? In this article, you’ll learn 5 keys to building a purpose driven acquisition strategy for your SaaS and how to avoid common mistakes along the way. Let’s go!SaaS companies need to first focus on building a relationship with a customer before getting them to sign up for the product. Other business models like eCommerce can focus on getting customers to make a purchase and then focus on building a deeper relationship with the user. Needless to say, the SaaS sales cycle is a long-drawn-out process--with the length of an average SaaS sales cycle being around 84 days as per research. Factors such as high product cost, privacy issues, complicated features, and innumerable product options are to blame for the long sales cycle.Speaking with respect to the SaaS customer acquisition costs industry benchmark, here's what the data tells us: If you want to accurately evaluate the ROI of your marketing campaign, you need to start tracking your customer acquisition cost (CAC) and the Lifetime Value of your Customer (LTV). This data can prove to be invaluable in understanding which channels to invest in, as well as analyze your marketing department’s core strengths and weaknesses (by comparing your CAC with the industry benchmarks).Now that you have a good understanding of why your customer acquisition costs should be the central focus of your SaaS marketing strategy, let's look at how to build a killer customer acquisition strategy for your SaaS.Before diving into creating your SaaS customer acquisition strategy, it’s helpful to  understand what other SaaS Marketers think about customer acquisition strategy:Tatev Hackobian, Marketing Expert at Krisp,  defines customer acquisition Strategy as a viable approach of understanding new customer's preferences and behavior and utilizing all the marketing channels to raise brand awareness and reach them to create an influential connection with them. Now that you know what other SaaS marketers mean when they say customer acquisition strategy, let’s look at what it takes to build a great SaaS customer acquisition strategy.Think of your brand's website as the first impression you'll be creating among your leads and prospects--it needs to be impressive, right?For instance, take a look at Proof's website, whose homepage doubles up as a live demo for their products on offer:To top it off, the brand delivers a hyper-personalized user experience in real-time (the homepage automatically adapts to the user's time zone and showcases strategically-placed CTAs). Ensuring that your homepage acts as a brochure/demo of your product can enable an informative, user-friendly, and engaging browsing experience.If you want to gain the lion's share of the market, you should keep the customers as the frontrunners of your business. It is not about demonstrating the benefits of your products, it is about demonstrating the value that your customers will gain while using your product.There are numerous ways to do this. Start by improving on the customer experience and integrating the live chat software on your website.Customers and prospects can instantly get in touch with an agent in real-time and get their queries addressed within seconds. To save the CX agent's valuable time, many customer support software allows integrating a knowledge base within the chat tool--including useful answers to repetitive user questions that customers can immediately (and effectively) get answers to:At every juncture of the customer lifecycle, ask yourself these two questions:You can make use of robust tools such as live chat to level up your customer experience and provide a powerful CX that's marked by speed, accuracy, and greater user satisfaction.This is one of the most tried-and-tested strategies that works wonders. In fact, according to research by Broadly, posting positive reviews can drive customer spending by 31%.   Luckily, you can showcase customer success stories in a number of ways such as:One of the biggest mistakes SaaS companies make is not having a complete picture of the pricing plans on the website.To save your customer's time and throw light on your brand's user-centric values, create a well-optimized pricing page as the following brands demonstrate below:Optimizing your pricing page allows your brand to honestly communicate your pricing details--a primary interest-point for most customers--and prevents unpleasant surprises by way of add-on features, etc., later on.  You can also include discount-related details within the annual subscription plans or showcase pricing plans based on specific user personas/smaller companies to accelerate the sales cycle. Truth be told, promotional content should make up for the smallest chunk of your content marketing strategy and SEO best-practices. As a thumb rule, SaaS companies should laser-focus on driving product-led content.If you need inspiration, take a look at Ahrefs' example, an SEO product:When curating content, do your research to understand if there's a search volume for search queries that your product can help address. The brand refers to this as the Business Potential Score. If the answer is yes, then you can avoid driving content based on the top, middle, and bottom funnels. Instead, produce product-centric content that demonstrates a true-to-life business potential. This includes relevant keywords and topics, and subtly pitches the product in question as an irreplaceable solution to your customer's pain point:Ahrefs effectively and subtly helps the audience to understand how they can use their tools to engage in SEO. The beauty lies in the content being as non-promotional, indirect, and product-centric to the extent possible. Plus, the use of a variety of value-driven and clearly-demarcated content categories (think: video, case studies, general SEO blogs, etc.) makes it well worth the read.Before we jump into the final section of this blog, let's hear from a marketer what a marketer needs to keep in mind while drafting customer acquisition strategy for SAAS businesses:My best advice is to segment your target clients, then create individual conversion funnels for each. This entails conducting extensive research, getting to know your customers, developing customer profiles, and then targeting each category differently.You can give a more relevant, personalized experience to SaaS leads and convert more customers by having educational information in various formats (interactive content, emails, blog posts, videos, etc.) for leads at each stage of your funnel. You can't have a wide consumer acquisition plan; instead, you'll need to get more specific. It's a lot easier to tailor your strategy for each consumer category once you know who you're aiming for.Before concluding this article, let's look at the common mistakes you should avoid like the plague when creating your SaaS customer acquisition strategy.There's no 'one-size-fits-all' approach that you can take to create a customer acquisition strategy that delivers on all accounts. Adding up to this, Jeffrey Kagan, co-founder of Nifty says; Nifty has always differentiated itself in acquiring customers in the competitive project management industry by understanding our ideal customer profile and targeting them - leading to a repeatable flywheel of new business and customers.Remember, at the end of the day, every brand's customer acquisition journey will look different--depending on their product, user base, brand's strengths, etc. Be sure to leverage the tips and hacks outlined above, and make sure to put in your own unique flavor to keep your user base loyal and happy throughout the sales cycle. To get the most out of your CAC strategy and monitor key metrics, allow Baremetrics to do the heavy lifting.

      "How to Bring Back Disengaged Users.\n",
      "At a time when there are more SaaS solutions than ever before, keeping users engaged and bringing back disengaged users with your product has become increasingly difficult.Companies spend so much energy and money trying to keep their hard-earned users, only to see them get bored and disengage from the brand.This brings us to the million-dollar question: Why is it so hard for companies to keep customers engaged after they sign up? In this article, you’ll learn how to keep your customers engaged and how to win them back in the event you lose them.Whatever the target audience, fostering user engagement is critical to any SaaS company.It begins as the customer has either followed an embedded link or hopped into the company’s email list. Marketers then spend a gazillion hours and money in an effort to retain customers. Yet, in the event you end up losing them, it happens because of these three key reasons:Many companies oversell their software to get their subscribers to sign up.. It's like promising white and delivering black. Or even, promising Seth Godin and delivering just ME. While it sounds like a great way to get your subscribers to act, it ends up doing worse than good by leading to an increase in churn and a hit on your brand. Customers will lose interest in your business the minute you stop living up to your promises. Remember when Tesla promised the hyper affordable Tesla Model 3 in 2016 for $35 000? People hugely prepaid for the car, but the company then fell short on their promise? Long story short, the company couldn’t deliver at that price and had to come up with an even more expensive model. Just for that, the company was a step away from going bust. An even worse way businesses do this is by surprising customers with hidden extra charges, which can make them angry and/or even look for a better deal.Not only will you see your churn rate increase, but you'll also see people disengage with your company completely.When users are actively using your product during a trial period, they are exponentially more likely to become paying customers. Just like retaining customers, converting users all comes down to engagement. Customer engagement is a bit like dating. You have to show some interest to the other party; otherwise, the relationship is going nowhere. This is why post-engagement strategies are a must. Do you have any software? You have to make sure users are making the most out of it and enjoying using it. Are you selling a product? You have to be sure it is helping your customers.A post-engagement strategy also helps you tailor your services to meet your customer’s expectations. Work with your users to pinpoint the things that drive home the value you’re offering to them. For Baremetrics, that’s connecting a data source like Stripe or Pipedrive, which ultimately gives our users hundreds of insights they’ve either never had before or spend an inordinate amount of time getting.Without a solid post-engagement strategy, nothing brings your brand back into the customer's mind. And most companies don't bother nurturing the relationship after acquiring customers. Data from Forrester shows that 45% of US customers abandon an online purchase over poor information. That’s huge.Poor information can be anything like a website filled with so much information that visitors are left wondering about the core message. Or even an email blasted with too many CTAs. Too much information amounts to poor communication, and too many CTAs can confuse readers. Readers lose focus over too many options, and that ultimately leaves them in the dark. As a result, potential users don’t get what they’d hoped for and have no clue what their next move should be. These simple gimmicks can be the exact thing a hesitant customer needs to make a decision. And that’s where you lose them. But, it’s not all doom and gloom. There’s a way to retain your customers after all.Winning back disengaged users doesn’t happen overnight. You have to be strategic and proactive about it. Here are a few tactics you can employ to foster customer engagement. A lapsed user is a user who has not reacted within a given period. For example, premium software users who have not been active on your platform within a considerable time frame. Usually, these customers are no longer satisfied or feel like your brand no longer aligns with their goals.You can create segmented audiences based on customers who have not opened emails or purchased within a specific time frame. And run an email marketing campaign that aims to get them back using your solution. Also, make sure to ask them why they stopped using your app/software at some point. This will help you better conceptualize what they need, and then you can tailor your services to better resonate with them.  Another way to re-engage your lapsed users is to offer them personalized content in your emails and on your website. Personalized email is a safe tunnel to reach your customers’ hearts. It helps them identify themselves with your company, and they’ll be more engaged. Here are a few more things you can do:You can also offer promotions to reward their loyalty. And most importantly, when you get notice of their inactivity, follow the heck out of them. For example, Grammarly constantly tracks and monitors users’ activity, and if they realize any inactivity within a period, they send this email: At the end of the day, if customers don't come back despite your efforts, always ask them if they want to unsubscribe. It helps you keep your email list clean and healthy.Remarketing has become an important way to get web users to return to the site they visited. Yet, it is one of the most underrated customer retention tactics. Case in point, 46 percent of marketers think remarketing is an underrated tactic.96% of visitors that come to your website are not ready to buy.By using remarketing techniques, you can show up where your potential customers are. For example, you can group users into segments and deliver individualized remarketing content. And so, after they leave your website, you send them a retargeting email campaign or ads to persuade them to reconsider your offer when they need it.But while doing so, make sure to tailor the remarketing towards the ideal prospects. Getting back a user who abandoned their cart before ordering is no difficulty. However, getting a user who only consulted one page to come back is.No one wants to lose the interest of a hard-earned customer, especially when statistics show that it costs five times more to get a new customer than to keep a loyal one.As bitter as it may be, there will always be users who will go silent or stop using your product altogether.And if like most businesses, you too have 50% of your revenue coming from repeat customers, then you need to consider win-back emails in your email marketing strategy. Win back emails are a great way to remind your customers why they signed up for your product in the first place. That rekindled interest can lead them to buy from you once again.Keep in mind that 45% of customers who receive a win-back email will open your future emails. Here is an example from WordStream.According to ActiveCampaign, the more win-back emails you send, the more likely you are to re-engage your inactive users.So they suggest a sequence of 5 emails like in the following picture.Send your disengaged users a casual email to stir up their minds about your business. It can also be a quick reminder that they have been inactive for a while. This will give the relationship a quick Ctrl + R and get you rocking again. Maybe the first touch was not enough to get them out of their shell. Bring on their table something that can help pique their interest. That can be a quick survey email asking for their feedback. Asking for customer feedback makes them feel that they matter to your brand. That also can help rekindle the relationship.You can't keep people as your customers if they don't act like one. Send them one last email to let them know that they will be removed from your mailing list if they don't respond. At the end of the day, it'll give you more time to serve your engaged clients better. If they still don’t react, unsubscribe them and keep your list healthy.Sounds like an unpopular opinion, but in most cases, when a customer complains, it's because they love your brand. Wisdom suggests that you leverage their complaints to better your service and gain their hearts.Plus, 83% of customers agree that they feel more loyal to your brand if you respond and resolve their complaints.So, with your customers, build relationships based on reactivity. People are streaming to platforms where they know their voices matter. Show up there and be empathetic.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a genius at this. During the 2017 last holiday season. He sent out a Christmas tweet where he thanked customers and asked how the company could improve.Customer engagement refers to campaigns aimed at reinforcing the customer's commitment. Organizations need to leverage user actions, use them to make changes, and improve their bounce rate. Here are three ways your company can better engage your customers today:In the age of user experience, nobody likes to bother with complicated things. Consumer behavior changes by the second. Customers are given myriads of options to solve one single problem. Today everyone likes Trello, tomorrow they prefer Basecamp.  It allows you to know what your customers want and what their current needs are.Here is how Lemlist does it:Automation has a ton of advantages, and we make good use of it with tools like Baremetrics Recover. But automation isn’t always the best means to keep users engaged. For example, it’s safe to send automated emails in a situation of cart abandonment, but customer service response emails should not be automated.Interestingly, sometimes you're just two minutes away from closing your biggest deal. And so, choosing to send an automatic reply instead of a more human-sounding one might cost you money.  There is no doubt that it has become challenging to keep customers loyal and engaged these days. With more SaaS solutions at your customer’s disposal than ever, finding ways to keep your current customers more engaged than ever.To make sure your customers come back to buy from you again and again, remember:Did we forget something you think is crucial to this post? Email us. If you want to leverage better insights to make better decisions for your customers, we recommend Baremetrics.

      "Data Enrichment vs. Lead Qualification.\n",
      "Sales outreach is one of the most important activities you can do to grow your SaaS company. This allows you to connect with potential buyers and qualify each as a legitimate lead. Since this is so closely related to your bottom line, lead qualification becomes critical. In the same breath, you and I both know that we have finite resources such as time and labor, we have to spend them wisely and maximize returns. How can we achieve this? The answer is by harnessing the power of data.In this article, we will discuss data enrichment vs. lead qualification and how they can both impact your bottom line.If you’re looking for a way to get the most out of your data and qualify your leads, check out Baremetrics feature, People Insights, to enrich your customer profiles today. Let’s first understand the basic concept of data enrichment. As a business, you will have internal data. It can be your customers’ details such as name, address, date of birth, marital status, and much more. For any SaaS/online business, it is likely to have far more data on something like how often your customers visit and use your product/services. All the data that you collect without any process is called raw data. The raw data, when left as it is, isn't creating value for your company. Only when you combine that disparate data and extract insights does it become an enriched asset for your organization.What does this mean when applied to your customer profiles? It means that by analyzing the profiles, with a tool like Baremetrics, you're able to extract insightful metrics including personalized segmentation, rich customer profiles, customer behavior tracking, manual subscriptions handling, and much more.With the right process and tools, all data points will become an important asset for your organization.When you have a SaaS product, finding out the most likely customers is a critical mission.  Lead qualification is the process of determining which customer is most likely to make a purchase decision regarding your product. As a software provider, there are many tactics you can use to qualify someone as a lead.  Here are some of the most common tactics in lead generation:In David T. Scott’s book The New Rules of Lead Generation, he describes these actions as getting people to “raise their hands” to signal that they are interested in buying your product or learning more. On your end, it’s crucial to collect enough information to continuously reach out to your leads and stay in touch until they’re interested in buying down the line. If you can use enriched customer profiles during communications with customers, you can increase a chance of closing a deal and also save cost by selecting the most probable customers.Let’s further clarify the methods of using data enrichment for lead qualification. The goal of lead qualification is knowing more about your customers so you can qualify them as a lead before reaching out. This is where Baremetrics’ People Insights mentioned earlier comes into play. With People Insights, you can gain clear visibility to a complete set of customer metrics using our intuitive dashboards. Here’s how it works:When a new customer starts a free trial, the dedicated dashboard section begins tracking and displaying the various data points. Want to see active subscriptions from only San Francisco? Or maybe customers that cancelled this week. People Insights does the heavy lifting for you and makes that possible.From there, you're able to further drill into more details about that particular prospect. This allows you to view things like:Along with more details about a particular customer, we’ve made it easy for you to track every charge, failed payment, and every other transaction within customer profiles.Having a central location where your customer information lives and is analyzed constantly giving you greater insights is a game changer. Don’t just take our word for it though, see what others are saying.Imagine you can read someone’s mind.Knowing better about your customers is like reading that person’s thought (not to sound creepy). If a person is not interested in your product, then it’s not worth reaching out and spending time convincing that person to buy.When your time spent does not lead to a purchase, it decreases a return on investment. Your time and all marketing activities are an investment for attracting new customers.

      "Baremetrics Recover: What You Need to Know.\n",
      "As a SaaS founder, you know that customer churn has the greatest negative impact on your business. You could continue iterating your onboarding flows, discover new acquisition channels, or even reach out to customers directly to ask them for feedback. But nothing you do is going to matter until you improve your churn. Fortunately, there are some easy wins out there. The easiest kind of churn to improve is involuntary churn.Involuntary churn (when a customer churns because of failed payments due to an expired credit card) is the kind of churn that will slowly eat away at your business if not addressed. That’s why Baremetrics Recover exists: to eliminate your pesky failed payments without the hassle of traditional accounts receivable tactics or lack thereof (more on this later).In this article, we’ll cover how you can eliminate involuntary churn, how to get the most out of using Baremetrics Recover, and why it’s the best solution out there.Involuntary churn, or passive churn, occurs when a customer’s account ends unintentionally.This can come as a result of the customer’s payment method failing and never being resolved. After a certain amount of time without payment, their subscription doesn’t renew, which results in churn.On average, 10% of the churn your company experiences month after month occurs due to involuntary churn. Yes, you heard that right: 10% of the revenue that any given SaaS company is bound to lose... can be avoided.This is a huge missed opportunity in your company (that most don’t take the time to tackle). Customers who churned involuntarily aren’t necessarily disappointed with your product, unlike those who canceled themselves. They usually have a billing error that is easy to fix.How do we suggest combating involuntary churn? Here are the 4 common ways companies are handling it today:Or, instead of running these processes manually, you can use Recover (wink, wink) to communicate directly with your customers and resolve their expired credit cards.Before you go tackling involuntary churn, it’s necessary to lay some groundwork to help you best understand the two processes at play when dealing with it:Accounts receivable refers to any outstanding invoices or money customers owe your company. This differs from account payables in that it is money that your company is obligated to receive for goods or services. How you approach AR for your SaaS will depend on which of the following buckets you fall in:Bucket #1: Your customers pay mostly via credit cardBucket #2: Your customers pay mostly via ACH (with an itemized invoice involved)Bucket #3: A mix of 1 and 2For SaaS companies dealing out large enterprise contracts, their AR process will involve a mix of customer outreach and resolving some failed credit card payments. Most enterprise contracts will be paid both via ACH transfer (instead of a credit card) and on an annual basis.If you find yourself in bucket #1 (as the majority of SaaS companies do), the AR process you should utilize is known as dunning. Dunning is the process of sending emails to your customers who have tried to pay, but whose payments have failed for some reason.Dunning is similar to traditional Accounts Receivable in that it’s dealing with money your company is owed. However, dunning specifically deals with recovering your customers’ failed payments.  Now that we’ve covered those terms, it’s time to get real.Hot Take: Regardless of what bucket you find yourself in, every SaaS company should be investing in a dunning process. If you run a SaaS company you need a dunning process because the majority of your customers do pay via credit card. Period. Having a dunning process in place ensures that you don’t continuously leave money on the table.When it comes to your involuntary churn and receivables, there’s no more need to do manual work, spend all your time chasing one unpaid customer, or even worse, have zero visibility into what’s going on with customer payments. There’s a better way and it starts with Baremetrics Recover. Here are 5 things you need to know about getting the most out of Recover:Generally speaking, the easier it is to do something, the more likely people are to do it. In this case, setting up Recover in your Baremetrics dashboard and updating billing information is as easy as it gets.Already set up with our metrics? Perfect. Integrations with your payment processor will already be set up with your core Baremetrics account. Simply click to enable the Recover add-on to start your dunning email sequence.Once you’ve added the Recover add-on in your dashboard, click on the Settings icon in the top right corner to begin customizing your dunning campaign. One of the biggest mistakes you can make with your dunning campaigns is to just send a single email and hope for the best. People put things off, emails get overlooked and life happens. If you want to recover more revenue from failed payments, you have to be persistent.With Baremetrics Recover you’ll have access to a series of emails you can customize and automate to be sent at different points over 30 days.Here you have the option to schedule out 6 emails to drip to your customers.You’ll have the option to choose where the customers will be sent when needing to update their credit card information. The {BillingURL} is the URL customers will land on when they click the link in Recover emails. In your settings, you can choose between either a Baremetrics hosted URL or your billing page. Finally, you can fully customize the content that will be sent to each of your customers based on the delinquency cadence pre-set in your dashboard. As well, you can customize based on name, plan size, and other attributes associated with your customer’s profile.To access, go to the ‘Content’ tab within your Emails setting in Recover. Under each email template, you’ll have the option of inputting different attributes you want to be included.From there you can send test emails, preview what it will look like once sent to a customer, and manage which email sequence is live or not. Dunning emails are very effective for recovering failed payments. But you can double down by including in-app reminders for customers to update their billing information. You can set this up in Recover so that when customers log in to your software, they’ll see a pop-up asking them to update their billing information.With Recover, you can take it a step further with our in-app callout message:Another feature that works hand in hand with the in-app paywalls is our credit card capture forms.Here you can customize the form to be on-brand for your company. This includes anything from your logo, title, CTA, colors, and URL. If you would like to use our embedded widget on your website, scroll down to the bottom of the credit card form page and use the code. Simply load the embed script everywhere on your website where you would like it to appear. NOTE: Leave everything as is except for the CUSTOMER_ID, which you should programmatically replace with each user's unique customer number given by your payment provider.Arguably the best feature Recover has to offer (besides fixing your failed payments of course) are the detailed insights that come with it. Similar to the Baremetrics home dashboard, you will be able to see an overview of Recover’s performance over its lifetime and the past 12 months. In the image below, you can see that $345,828.66 was lost due to failed credit card payments. However, $221,307.29 was recovered using Baremetrics Recover. That’s a lot of money saved!Additional metrics that you can find in your Recover dashboards are:From automating an email sequence to tracking campaigns, and creating a customized experience for your customers, Recover makes it simpler than ever to manage your dunning. And don’t forget, you can save thousands of dollars in revenue churn while you’re at it. Even if you’re thinking to yourself, “I only have 100 customers, is it worth paying for?” The answer is yes!Awesome --- now that you’re sold on needing a dunning process to tackle your involuntary churn, it’s time to talk dunning solutions. You may be thinking, “Since my company uses Stripe, I’ll just use their dunning tool.”Tempting as that is, it’s not the best move for someone looking to end their churn, and here’s why:Stripe provides the basics for processing your payments, but growing SaaS & subscription companies upgrade to Baremetrics Recover for more depth and accuracy when managing their dunning. We love and respect the team at Stripe tremendously, but there’s also a reason why we exist.At the end of the day, the goal of your business is to grow revenue month after month. With involuntary churn, that goal becomes very hard to achieve.Going with a tool like Baremetrics Recover gives you a competitive advantage that most businesses choose to ignore. Not to mention, Recover pays for itself 38× over, so what are you waiting for? It's a no-brainer.We’re so confident that you’ll love using Recover and the positive ROI it’ll have for your company that we’ll let you try Recover completely for free, no strings attached, for 14 days. Sounds like a win-win (and by win-win I mean you-win) to me!To start recovering failed payments for your business, sign up for Baremetrics Recover today.\n"

      "How to Drive SaaS Growth With Cold Email.\n",
      "People hate cold emailing. They think it’s a waste of time to create lists and send campaigns when the average cold email open rate is 22%.But don’t let those numbers hold you back from investing in cold email for your SaaS. When you know what you’re doing, cold email can be lethal.Below are the results of my last four email campaigns where I got an average of 81% open rate and a 33.5% response rate.This article was possible with the help of Baremetrics. Try it out now for free.It's hard to talk to people if you don't know who they are.So the first step to a successful cold outreach campaign is to define your customer avatar.Many people like to complicate this stuff.Don’t get me wrong, using Hubspot’s Make My Persona to create elaborate fantasies about their target is one way to do it. But for the sake of conversation let’s keep it simple.First, imagine who in the company has the “decision power” for what action I want the company to take.Then, write down three things that are typical for this group of people:That’s it. Now, knowing what to write here gets easier once you’ve been in the industry for a while. You meet people. You talk to them. And you get familiar with their day-to-day duties.So don’t worry if you aren’t 100% sure what to write in this step just yet. Once you nail your customer avatar, crafting irresistible cold emails becomes a walk in the park.Oftentimes, cold outreach is used to get backlinks. So let’s use an example from that kind of ask.Ideal targets (in order): Content Strategist, Content Manager, SEO specialist, Content Editor, VP of Marketing, Chief Marketing Officer, Author.Something they love:Something they hate:A problem they have:Having this in front of you, it becomes easier to write emails that convey more of the stuff they love and less of the stuff they hate.Now that you know the details of your target audience, you're ready to start putting your list together.To do that you need to:Let’s go through each one step by step.How you go about doing this depends on what you want to achieve in the first place.If you want to build links and promote your content, then you need to use a tool like Ahrefs to scrape websites linking to articles with similar keywords that you want to rank for.But if you want to pitch your products or services, then you’d want to find niche-specific company pools that collect information like company revenue, location, industry, etc.And it’s actually pretty easy to find them. Simply search for “top companies in your category” in Google. Like:Pitch targets for days.Now, go through the list and copy the website URLs into a Google spreadsheet.One of the best ways to find decision makers is by heading over to the company’s LinkedIn profile and doing a “people search”.This requires a ton of tab-switching, manual clicking, and data sifting… In short: it’s super time-consuming. But there are a few tricks on how to do it much faster.WARNING: The following steps might seem complicated, but if you do it a couple of times you can find a name in literally 30 seconds or less.Trick #1First, take your sheet of company URLs and paste this formula in the next column:This will pre-generate a list of Google “search” URLs so we can skip the step of typing out the following query for each companyTrick #2Instead of double-clicking on each link to open it, you can use Open Multiple URLs chrome extension to open multiple URLs at once.Simply copy about 10-20 google search URLs and paste them in the extension like so:(Pro tip: keep two browsers open side by side while doing this.)Then click “Open URLs”.Now simply copy-and-paste the first Google result like so:(If you’re wondering how to close the tabs, press Ctrl+W right after Ctrl+C.)Trick #3Now create another column and paste this code into it:Which tells Google to “check on linkedin.com/in if there’s anyone with the job title of intext that works for intitle”(If the variables seem confusing, it’s just how the LinkedIn website is structured.)Knowing this you can create your own search URL, targeting job titles that you care about.(Also know that “%20” in the URL acts as space, and | as an “or” operator.)Finally, use the extension to open the search URLs and grab the name that feels most appropriate.Boom!You can do this manually through...But if you value your time then you can simply take the name and company URL and plug them into an email finder tool like Voila Norbert:Norbert will spit back an email address in less than a second. You can also find the emails in bulk by exporting your spreadsheet as a CSV and uploading it into Norbert then download the results in bulk:Nice! At this point we’re done building our cold outreach list — arguably the grindiest part of cold emailing.Now it’s time to write your cold emails.Like many things, people like to overcomplicate this part.It’s tempting to have endless discussions about email personalization, the maximum number of characters in a subject line, or whether you should capitalize the letters or not…That’s all smoke and mirrors. In my opinion, your cold email needs only two things:Everything else is optional. Sure, it may or may not give you an edge, but without a good offer, you won’t close the deal no matter how many times you include the person's name in the email. So let’s focus on what matters.The most important part of the subject line is the contact list.Because if you’ve invested time and effort into steps 1 and 2, you have a targeted list of people with known pain points. (Remember the customer avatar.)So your subject line should literally be that pain point.You can either:For example:If you’re offering SEO services and you’ve noticed that a company on your list is investing effort into their blog but isn’t getting the ranks they deserve…Your subject line could be:If you haven’t investigated the companies that well, you can still “guess” the pain point and tie it with your offer.Just know that in this case, many people won’t open your email. But that’s okay, because with a well-crafted subject line, people who are interested in your offer will open it, and people that are not… well, we don’t really care if they open or not so it doesn’t matter.It’s kind of a trade-off. Want to send more emails but get lower conversion rates? Or spend more time researching and send fewer emails but get a higher conversion rate?Up to you.A “no brainer” offer is an offer where the customer doesn’t have anything to lose and everything to gain.In other words, you have to be the one risking more than the customer.But risking what, exactly? Attention, time, and currency.Think of it like this: You simply have to give more than you request.Here’s how that would look like in an email:Here’s how the copywriting works in this email.1. Intro: “just a quick heads up” gives the tone that this email isn’t a sales pitch.2. First Paragraph: Calls out the problem and explains the damage it’s causing the client: instilling stress.3. Picture: Offers proof that justifies the stress response.4. Parentheses part: Qualifies your solution as unique and “secretive”: increasing perceived value and instilling desire.5. CTA Part: Offers the client a “no-brainer” solution for free with a chance to instantly schedule a call. The stress is relieved when the client makes the appointment.6. Signoff: Showing off expertise (“SEO specialist” in this case) with a link to a well-designed website increases trust.7. P.S.: A one-line testimonial further increases trust.If you want to take it even further, you can — instead of scheduling a call and making the customer risk 15 minutes of their time — record a video of what you’d say in the consulting call.(For a SaaS, the equivalent would be to give out the login details of a pre-generated test account.)But, as promised before, you can also keep it very, very simple.Here’s an email that I’ve used to get the results I’ve shown you in the intro.Yep, it’s just one line. Containing an awesome “no-brainer” offer. Because who wouldn't want a free backlink?Only once I give I ask if I can get one in return — BUT I specifically state “no worries if not”.And you’ll always get it.If you’re looking to find the email addresses of key decision makers, then Voila Norbert is one of the most accurate email finders you can use.

      "MetricFire is a full-scale platform that offers infrastructure, system, and application monitoring using a suite of open-source monitoring tools. MetricFire allows you to use Graphite-as-a-service to have your metrics displayed on user-friendly and aesthetically-pleasing Grafana dashboards. MetricFire offers five subscription tiers according to the needs of different organization types. Each plan can be run using Graphite with Grafana Dashboards.SaaS companies like SalesForce, Xfinity, Accenture and more rely on MetricFire to visualize their data in real-time and stay on top of their systems.Baremetrics spoke to MetricFire’s Business Operations Manager Elliot Langston to learn more about how they use Baremetrics to analyze Stripe data and segment customers.  MetricFire is an international team with employees in Japan and the United States. At one point, the company was larger and had a teammate devoted primarily to billing and financial reporting. But when the team reorganized two years ago, billing and financial reporting were delegated to Langston, who also oversees business development and customer success. To accomplish these tasks, Langston turned to MetricFire’s Stripe account. Stripe is the leading payment processing service for SaaS and subscription businesses. Its platform handles recurring payments from customers all over the world, supports different pricing models, and has developer-friendly features that allow for limitless customization.Stripe’s in-app metrics feature, however, is limited to just 16 metrics. And in MetricFire’s experience, the reporting gave misleading  Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) figures for two reasons:  As a workaround, Langston would create dummy accounts in Stripe and link those to the incorrectly recorded payments. Doing this repeatedly, however, was not sustainable. Since Stripe is a payment processor, there’s always a chance that human error would result in a billing mistake such as a customer being charged incorrectly.On top of that, there’s no ability to customize the date views in Stripe, so users can only look at their data in fixed time periods like four weeks, one year, and two year periods. Finally, in addition to limited and inaccurate analytics, Stripe’s platform doesn’t include the ability to segment customer data. This made it hard for Langston to efficiently organize customers by geographic location. In order for MetricFire to grow their business, their team needed a tool to:Baremetrics’ robust toolset simplified MetricFire’s billing and reporting processes, allowing them to keep their team size optimized and focused on revenue-generating tasks. Stripe provides basic analytics for SaaS metrics, but growing SaaS & subscription companies upgrade to Baremetrics for efficient, accurate, and in-depth reporting.The MetricFire team checks the Baremetrics Control Center at least once a day to keep a pulse on financial activity. Here they can view MRR (recurring revenue only), Net Revenue, Average Revenue Per User, MRR growth rate, and 17 other metrics- all in one place.  Below is Baremetrics’ actual control center. You can see it in real-time here!MetricFire integrated their Baremetrics account with Slack to get notifications about upgrades, downgrades, and failed charges in real time. When Langston sees a notification, he goes into Pipedrive and takes the appropriate course of action. Here’s an example of a Slack notification in the Baremetrics team channel. Customer segmentation is essential for understanding your customer base: who they are, where they are, what they do, how long they’ve been your customer, and more. SaaS companies might segment customers according to MRR, whether they’re B2B or B2C, or in MetricFire's case, geographic location. Here’s what the customer segmentation tool looks like when Baremetrics segments customers by geographic location, or in other words, where the active credit card on file is located: Before using Baremetrics, Langston would copy and paste tons of data into spreadsheets. Then, he would write formulas to organize the information. This tedious process would take up to one whole business day to complete.Now, using the Segmentation tool, Langston organizes customers in seconds. His team then compares segments by size and growth rate, and uses the information to inform expansion opportunities. To learn more about MetricFire, check out their blog.

      "How to Create a SaaS Marketing Plan in 7 Steps.\n",
      "Anyone in tech can tell you, the SaaS industry is growing at an insane rate. With over 21,000 SaaS companies in the market, the growth is projected to continue by the end of 2021, reaching $157 billion. With the number of SaaS companies increasing, it is crucial for you to follow certain growth strategies to outdo your competitors.If there’s one brand you and I can learn from to become better SaaS marketers, it’s HubSpot. From ranking for over 34,000 keywords to running its own knowledge base (i.e., HubSpot Academy), HubSpot has aced the SaaS marketing game in more ways than one.Following HubSpot’s lead is a good way to prepare your SaaS product marketing plan, but to do so effectively you’ll need a step-by-step process to get started.In this article, we will walk through 7 steps for creating a solid marketing strategy for your SaaS product. By following this process and using a tool like Baremetrics, you’ll generate more revenue and outdo your competitors in the process.There is no one-size-fits-all customer for a SaaS product. There will always exist a pool of customers you can target when marketing your product.  Let’s understand this with an example.When Spotify arrived on the scene, their first instinct was to market to everyone since music holds a universal appeal. However, they came up with a more nuanced strategy to identify their buyer personas—a semi-fictional representation of their ideal customer.  Spotify’s long-drawn process of crafting buyer personas looked into:The brand used these factors to draw out its ideal customers.Spotify’s example shows the most important factor in creating your buyer personas is mapping out their characteristics. To do the same for your company, write down how your buyers would behave and create different profiles based on these points.To build a solid marketing that convinces prospects to sign up for a free trial, demo, or a paid version of your product, you need a set of measurable marketing goals. Together with realistic and defined goals, you should have some clear metrics to track your progress as well.Some of the most common SaaS marketing metrics are:The first step is outlining the goals specific to your product. Then proceed with defining your key performance indicators (KPIs) to track metrics for success.Here at Baremetrics, we suggest using the SMART goals framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-Bound) to focus on what activities are critical to getting results. An example of a SMART goal would be something like, “Acquire 1,000 new users over the next 3 months in the US Market”.Once it’s time to execute against your goals, breaking down each goal into time frames that are easier to digest is great to get momentum. Doing so will ensure you identify key daily and weekly tasks/processes. Let’s look do this for the SMART goal we set above:If you want to acquire 1,000 new users this quarter in the US alone, you’ll need to acquire X number of new users per month. Your monthly target would be 333 new users within the US market. From there you can break it down even further to weekly or daily targets.It can be difficult to know what KPI’s you should track for SaaS growth. These are commonly used SaaS marketing KPIs:At this stage, you know the who, what, and why of your marketing plan—let's talk about the how.Building a marketing plan starts with learning from your competition. If you are new to the market, there is no better way to grow than to see what your competition is doing and how your ideal customers are responding to it.Multiple factors come into play when creating a competitor analysis report. Some key indicators to consider are:This study will give you a fair idea about what your competition is doing right.

      "SaaS Financial Benchmarks by Baremetrics.\n",
      "For SaaS companies, success depends highly on using key metrics to track financial growth and enhance visibility into all the key performance indicators. Another major interest is comparing one's growth and performance with other companies in similar SaaS niches. For every decision-maker in a SaaS company, understanding SaaS financial benchmarks makes a proper interpretation of your internal performance metrics.A benchmark is any value or measurement against which you can compare the performance of something. When looking at our businesses, it’s great to have benchmarks for how other businesses are doing, so we can see if we're performing higher or lower than the industry standard.A SaaS financial benchmark refers to benchmarks that are specifically focused on average performance in the SaaS world. In particular, a SaaS financial benchmark is a benchmark about something financial, such as MRR, ARR or other financial metrics that are commonly used throughout the SaaS world.At Baremetrics, we understand that SaaS companies need to consult SaaS financial benchmarks to discover, at a glance, what’s normal in the industry and what’s not. It's the only way to stay competitive, successful, and relevant within any SaaS product niche. SaaS financial benchmarks provide the sort of clarity that gives companies greater visibility and analysis of their metrics. Baremetrics provides SaaS financial benchmarks in two categories. The first category, which you will readily find as Open Benchmarks, is only a tiny peek into the extensive financial benchmarks that Baremetrics has collected from over 800 businesses over the years. The full collection of benchmarks are accessible with a free trial for the Baremetrics Benchmarks feature in-app.Open Benchmarks shows quick summaries for general cohort analysis, while a free trial can give you access to smart features that produce key metrics comparisons in accessible, plain language. With industry benchmarks, SaaS companies like yours can make effective decisions about strategic resource investments that result in solid revenue and soaring valuations.   It’s impossible to know the industry average unless you have similar information from hundreds of companies. Fortunately, Baremetrics collects financial data from hundreds of companies, and we publish that data in an anonymized and accessible way.Below is a shortlist of 10 actionable financial benchmarks that Baremetrics provides; Baremetrics is a unique product that has access to the financial analysis being done by its customers. With each customer’s permission, Baremetrics collects, anonymizes, and publishes financial benchmarks using this data.Typically, a SaaS company will undertake some internal cohort analysis to compute some of the metrics described earlier. However, the challenge is using your internal cohort analysis results for a cohort comparison, which yields actionable financial benchmarks that put your company's internal cohort analysis results into perspective. The metrics published on Open Benchmarks show, in explicit detail, how your SaaS company currently compares with other companies during cohort analysis.Here's a quick breakdown of SaaS financial benchmarks for companies recording $25-$50 average revenue per user (ARPU):Financial MetricFinancial Benchmark for companies with $25-$50 ARPU If your SaaS company happens to have a customer ARPU that falls within the $25-$50 range, you can already tell if your numbers are right or if they need some more work. Take the LTV financial benchmark, for instance. It’s well-known that if your customer LTV exceeds the cost of customer acquisition (CAC), then that customer is profitable, and you can go ahead to acquire similar customers. However, it isn't always enough to know that your customer is profitable within this specific cohort value when LTV is compared with the CAC; that's only an internal performance metric. It’s still a good idea to weigh your internal financial metrics with those of other companies. With this comparison, you can be sure that your company numbers and values are up to the industry standard in addition to just being profitable. The paid Benchmarks and Smart Dashboards tools take a deeper dive into the insights that can be uncovered in your business’s finances. Together, these Baremetrics tools make your company's financial analysis and growth easily trackable. It isn't news that your customers experience failed payments. As scandalous as this may sound, customers often want to keep paying for something but forget to because of something like a missed credit card transaction. Incredibly, Companies lose up to 10% on failing payments monthly. All you need to do to get that money out of your customer base is start prompting them when their credit card transactions don’t go through.At Baremetrics, we’re constantly looking into why these failed payments occur. We even look into the specific card types that fail, and what benchmarks we can see about failed payments.Failed payments are a financial metric that is overlooked, but with the correct information about its frequency and how similar companies are moving to stop it, it can become a thing of the past. With the SaaS financial benchmarks provided by Baremetrics, you can know precise details about the following data; Nothing gives a company an edge like knowing that their numbers are just right (or knowing what they must do to get their numbers just right). Everything else follows; goal-setting, pivots and iterations, agile development, and so much more. From glances at the industry benchmarks to in-depth cohort comparisons, the Baremetrics Benchmark feature provides your company with the vital signs it needs to grow and succeed.

      "Price Optimization in SaaS: A Series.\n",
      "Many SaaS subscription products launch with prices far below their potential value.Maybe they do this to encourage sign-ups. Or perhaps it’s just a stab in the dark.Regardless of the cause, there seems to be a strong potential for increased revenue from price adjustment.That's why we're writing an entire series of articles about price optimization- specifically for subscription-based businesses. Below are the articles written so far. Check back soon for more!This introductory article covers topics relevant to price optimization for subscription businesses.  The biggest challenge that some leaders face is understanding how to think about price optimization and customer retention with the right framework. This article discusses the relationship between price change and customer retention, as well as the best metrics and methods for measurement.To get a reliable signal for our price optimization, we need to collect data in a structured way. If we plan our data collection carefully, our  experiment avoids wasting resources on inconclusive results.Our third article explains in detail why experiments are key for finding the best price, and what data you to run experiments correctly. Churn is talked about so often in the SaaS world that many think it's the most important metrics to track. But is it actually?We put the churn metric to test in two different simulations. The result: it often gives misleading results. Learn why. \n"

      "6 Tips for Effective Data Sharing using Baremetrics.\n",
      "Data plays a key role in maximizing growth in your SaaS company. And when I say “data is key”, I mean only the data that is readily available and accessible to the people who need it. A lot of information goes unmeasured and unnoticed, and a lot of data isn’t put to good use.How can you use the data that you have to make well-informed decisions across your company? We recommend you to:Using a tool like Baremetrics that can keep track of your financial metrics on an easy-to-use dashboard is critical. It enables your company to gain visibility on specific metrics in real-time, enabling teammates to act on changes in your pipeline. When it comes to your team, everyone in your business needs data that is accurate and consistent to optimize what they do to drive revenue. In this article, we’re going to break down what data sharing is, why it is important, and how you can share data effectively using Baremetrics. Let’s go!Data sharing is the method of making data available to others through a variety of mechanisms, applications, or users. The short and the sweet is that you’re simply taking data that you currently have and making it available (ie your team, investors, etc). For the sake of conversation, it’s helpful to understand data visualization as well. Data sharing has to do with the method of sharing and data visualization is how you present data. Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables you as the decision-maker to see metrics presented visually, to better grasp difficult concepts, and to identify new patterns. With visualization, you can go the extra mile with your data by using tools that create charts and graphs for more detail, interactively changing what data you see and how it’s processed.In the screenshot above, you can see a visualization of the entire company's financial data in one glance. This is effective data visualization.Justin Talerico, SaaS Founder and current GM of Ecommerce at A Cloud Guru say it’s important to share data properly because of two important caveats: He says that “understood by your teams” isn’t the same as understood by the founder or the C-level. As a founder, you know what your metrics are telling you, but that doesn’t mean your team does. “Ask them to explain it to you”. If the people on your team are being asked to make decisions that lead to growth, helping them understand the numbers is critical to do so.“The other important word is “perceived”. It’s important because even if your data is solid if it’s perceived as shaky or inaccurate, the entire data-driven management process is undermined. Trust is critical to belief. Belief is critical to passion. And passion means the difference between striving to think big and settling for incremental gains.”To make the wheels go round at your company it takes your entire team being on the same page about how you make decisions. In today’s world where everything can (and probably should) be measured, feeling confidence in the data you’re sharing and those you’re sharing it with is critical. If you’re struggling with reporting on your financial metrics, use Baremetrics to automatically get great financial reporting and data sharing. Check out the live demo right here, or sign up for the free trial and start using it now!Your team is lean, mean, and a data collecting machine. With the tremendous amounts of data that Internet/SaaS businesses gather, establishing a system for processing it all is step one. After your analytics/ metrics tool is set up, now comes the real challenge: sharing that data across your team. Where should you start? Here are some tips on some of the best ways to share your data with your team, based on what works for us here at Baremetrics:Your team should be able to access any metrics that are relevant to their job. Instead of being bombarded with requests to see X, Y, and Z, why not make your data readily available?If you’re using Baremetrics, you can do so by creating segmented dashboards to share with your team. Simply log in to your account → create a new dashboard → title your new dashboard and add the widgets for which metrics you’re wanting to track. If you’re wanting to bypass that and share your entire dashboard with each team member, that’s an option that others go with as well:“I share the dashboard with our internal employees, and they're able to monitor how we're doing.”Having access to the necessary data isn’t enough, you and your team need to be able to make sense of your key metrics. Remember what Justin Telarico said, your numbers “must be understood by your team”. One way we do this here at Baremetrics is by coaching our team to understand and use our publicly accessible dashboards. Nobody is perfect so some people may misuse the data or make false assumptions. At Baremetrics we’ve prioritized a user-friendly and minimalist UI to make sure users don’t have any barriers to understanding their data. But great education and coaching are also significant. Feel free to pass on the Baremetrics Academy articles to your users so everyone can understand the real impact of this information.Making your numbers easy to consume is only part of the battle. Your reports are useless if people aren’t looking at them frequently.  You need to get comfortable with marketing and distributing your reports to your company. Many companies invest a lot of time and energy in marketing internally. For instance, Wix uses different channels such as Slack, Monday.com, and emails to inform their team about new reports and insights on the current metrics. Using tools like these to remind stakeholders about all that’s at their disposal is a solid way to create engagement across your company. Here at Baremetrics, our team utilizes similar channels to bring attention to the entire team: To amplify your internal marketing, we suggest sharing cool insights or team wins:Using channels to share insights is key to both educating your team on what’s relevant to your company and helping everyone make better data-driven decisions. Being totally open with your team about what’s under the hood is something that can be extremely beneficial. Openness with your company adds humanity to something that’s generally thought of as faceless. This helps you to connect with customers and offer a service with integrity. Companies and startups had been historically tight-lipped about things like revenue numbers and customer retention. In 2015, here at Baremetrics, we opted to go against that grain. And our Open Startups initiative was born. This initiative has been our attempt to highlight companies willing to be radically transparent with their teams and customers -- join the movement today!Sharing data with your team is one thing, but doing so with other stakeholders such as key investors or advisors is another. “While senior stakeholders are keen to understand why decisions are made, they are largely unfamiliar with the complexity and nuances of the data itself. They want to see the bottom line, and the net effect of the data.” (source)Since senior stakeholders aren’t a part of the daily operations, you will need to be more strategic and consistent with how you share data. Here are a few suggestions on how to do that:You can see these metrics directly in your Baremetrics dashboard.Those are the basic questions anyone running, advising, or investing in a SaaS company needs to know because they give you direct insights into how your company is doing. We spoke earlier about creating straightforward dashboards for team members on metrics that are relevant day-to-day.The real fun comes in when you go deeper and take advantage of segmentation and data augmentation, which can be helpful when presenting to key investors or advisors.Being able to connect other data sources like your CRM, marketing automation tool, and others can help you answer more advanced questions, like:Having data to answer these questions gives greater context for those making the business decisions, instead of just guessing and making assumptions.For instance, if you notice an increase in MRR from a specific region, you could put more marketing dollars towards them. Or if one plan is resulting in higher churn than the others, you can dive into why.I won’t dive into it here, but we also have some add-on products you can use to get analytics for customers who cancel and even failed charges.Don’t underestimate the power of simply taking a screenshot and sending updates that way. Modern tools like CloudApp, Loom, or the good ol’ Shift + Command + 4 will do the trick. Hear from another one of our customers on how this simple method works for them:\"We send monthly emails with our MRR and ARR numbers. For quarterly board meetings, we have screenshots of the dashboarding modules and draw through them.\"To grow your SaaS, you can’t ignore the data. In the same breath, how you share your data within your team and amongst key stakeholders is just as important. That’s why your team should use a tool like Baremetrics, a SaaS metrics tool that provides 26 different metrics about your business, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, total customers, and more. Baremetrics integrates directly with your payment gateways and other tools, so the necessary data about your customers is automatically piped into the Baremetrics dashboards.

      "Stripe vs. Profitwell.\n",
      "“One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions.”-          Grace M. HopperHow can you know if your SaaS business is profitable or not? Do you know what works well for your business and what doesn’t?That’s where SaaS metrics come into play and tell you what you need to know. They give you the data you need to help you make informed decisions about your business. Using the wrong metrics, using them in the wrong way, or overlooking the crucial ones can be a disaster for your business. There are so many business metrics platforms out there that it becomes hard to choose the one you actually need. In this article, we have compared Stripe vs. Profitwell to see what each tool can do for you and what they can’t. By the end of the article, you will have a clear overview of both these platforms.To get a brief overview:Profitwell is a tool that can provide analytics for SaaS businesses. It has a variety of tools that monitor and analyze the performance of SaaS businesses.Stripe is different. Stripe is an online payment processing platform for Internet businesses, something like PayPal. It does provide some metrics but not that many. You can integrate Stripe with a metrics platform such as Baremetrics to get more detailed insights in the Smart SaaS Dashboard.While Stripe is a payment processing platform, both Profitwell and Baremetrics are strictly business metrics monitoring tools that integrate with Stripe to bring you more in-depth knowledge about your transactions.If you want to see it all first-hand, signup for a Baremetrics free trial and monitor your subscription revenues with ease.Profitwell is a SaaS analytics platform that provides subscription analytics, retention, and pricing solutions for both B2B and B2C subscription services.Founded by Patrick Campbell in 2019, the platform can monitor several metrics such as lifetime value (LTV), average revenue per user (ARPU), monthly recurring revenue (MRR), user engagement, etc.The tools it offers are:·     Profitwell Metrics, the flagship product of Profitwell that monitors the metrics mentioned above.·         Recognized, which tracks finances and handles revenue recognition.·         Retain, the churn reduction tool.·         Price Intelligently, which figures out pricing for subscription businesses.Profitwell is a freemium service having some of its features available for free, while others ranging from $1000/month to $15,000/month or even more.Stripe is a payment processing tool or sometimes called a payment gateway. Without getting too technical here, let me briefly explain what a payment gateway is.A payment gateway is an online software for managing transactions. When a customer makes a purchase on your website, the payment gateway sends the cardholder information to the merchant account—a dedicated bank account for holding funds coming from credit card transactions. The transaction is confirmed after verifying the information provided.  Now, let’s look at Stripe specifically —the Internet’s Middleman, founded by Collison brothers. Stripe takes payments from credit or debit cards of your customers from all over the world and transfers the funds directly to your business bank account.Stripe charges you 2.9% plus 30 cents for every successful transaction. You can visit their website to see more details on their pricing.Stripe also helps you reduce churn with its dunning tools that recover about 41% of failed recurring payments. You can automate payments and power any billing model.For SaaS businesses like yours, Stripe provides a set of tools that help you collect recurring payments with support for a variety of pricing models. It also offers a few metrics to help you monitor the growth, products, subscribers, retention, and a few other things.However, Stripe’s metrics are not enough to get the complete picture. This is where tools like Baremetrics or Profitwell come into play.Both Stripe and Profitwell can provide you with several metrics to monitor your business.Stripe Billing Analytics dashboard gives you metrics such as MRR, MRR growth, net revenue, LTV, subscriber cohort and cohort retention. Stripe’s dunning tools help you reduce involuntary churn and recover failed recurring payments.Profitwell also gives you all these analytics as well as some advanced ones. Profitwell’s Retain feature is designed to reduce churn and recover customers.Despite the few similarities, Stripe and Profitwell are widely different from each other as they are designed for different purposes.As we have seen earlier, Profitwell is a platform that monitors various metrics for SaaS and other subscription based businesses. It also provides pricing solutions for B2B and B2C services. It tracks finances, provides pricing solutions, and displays user engagement stats.Stripe is designed for a whole different purpose. It’s a payment gateway that facilitates online transactions on your website. It also provides a bunch of metrics, but they are not extensive. You will need a dedicated SaaS metrics monitoring platform such as Baremetrics to get deeper insights.What exactly is Baremetrics and how can it help you if you are already using Stripe?Baremetrics has been helping B2B and B2C SaaS companies and subscription businesses since 2013 with its accurate metrics, as well as its dunning and engagement tools. By providing you real-time metrics and revealing crucial insights, it helps you make profitable decisions.To use Baremetrics, all you have to do is connect your Stripe account to Baremetrics. It then pulls in all of your revenue data using Stripe Connect to give you more details and insights about your payments that you can’t get on Stripe.Whether you are just starting out or you have already established yourself, Baremetrics has got you covered at every stage of your business.

      "Get accurate financial metrics with Baremetrics.\n",
      "Accuracy is an issue when it comes to financial metrics. Keeping track of all of your different sources of income, and doing so to the extent where you can say “this is the correct MRR for the entire business”, is nearly impossible. Then, let’s say you succeeded to track MRR with accuracy, how about your expenses? That’s a whole other ball game.Some people will use PayPal or another payment gateway to keep track of their revenue and expenses - but what if Stripe isn’t the only payment gateway you use? What if some customers are paying by invoice? What if some expenses are on a credit card?Another major question is deciding which financial metrics are worth tracking for your business. The financial metrics you use depend on your industry, size of the company, types of shareholders, and more. Some people opt to use a tool like Baremetrics that can pull your sources of data together and calculate your metrics quickly and accurately. With Baremetrics you can see your metrics crystal clear like this:Check out the live demo of the Baremetrics to see more or sign up for the Baremetrics free trial to start using it now!This article will go over the key financial metrics you should be monitoring for different kinds of businesses, as well as how to quickly automate actions based on your financial metrics.Let’s dive in!Let’s take a look at some of the common financial metrics analysts use to better understand businesses. The metrics here may not apply to every situation, as every company has a different capital structure, revenue streams, and expenses.1. Gross Profit Margin - This metric indicates the amount of money left over from sales after subtracting the cost of your sales. Gross Profit Margin = (Net Revenue - Cost of Sales) / Net Revenue * 1002. Net Profit Margin - This metric compares net profit to your revenue. Net profit is a value that is calculated based on revenue, cost of sales, expenses, interest, and taxes. If you compare Net Profit to your Revenue, you will be able to see how much of your Revenue you are retaining as profit after all the environmental factors (taxes/interest rates, etc.) are taken into account. Net Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Sales - Expenses - Interest - Taxes) / (Revenue) *100Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue * 1003. Working Capital - This is the amount of money a company has to work with. This metric measures the difference between all of your assets and everything you owe to someone else. Your assets are everything of value, such as cash, accounts receivable, raw materials, properties, etc. Your liabilities, or everything you owe, are things such as accounts payable, rent, etc.Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities4. Current Ratio - It indicates the ability of the business to honor its current obligations, or in layman’s terms - does a company have enough assets to pay off all of its dues within this year.Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities5. Quick Ratio - Similar to the current ratio, the Quick Ratio compares your current assets to your current liabilities. The key difference is Quick Ratio does not count your inventory towards your assets. This means that the Quick Ratio shows only assets that can be sold off quickly to pay off your liabilities. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities6. Debt to Equity Ratio - This ratio indicates the ratio of total debt or liabilities with the amount of Shareholder equity. This shows you how a company’s capital is weighted, whether it’s weighted more towards debt or more toward equity financing.Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders Equity7. Total Asset Turnover - This ratio measures the company's ability to generate sales using the fixed assets investments. In other words, it assesses the ability of a company to generate net sales from its existing machines and equipment efficiently.      Total Asset Turnover = Revenue / ((Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2)8. Return on Equity - The Return on Equity (ROE) ratio is a profitability ratio used for measuring the return that an organization earns on Shareholders' Equity. In essence, The Net Profit that the organization makes for every unit of Shareholders Equity.ROE = Net Profit / ((Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2 )9. Return on Assets - Return on Assets helps to find out how a company is utilizing its assets. ROA is a profitability ratio that tells us how well a company uses its assets to fuel its profits.ROA = Net Profit / ((Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets ) / 2 )10. Operating Cash Flow - Indicates the amount of cash a business generates from its operations. It can be calculated via two methods: direct or indirect. The direct method of calculating cash flow uses real receipts and transaction statements to account for everything. The indirect use totals in your assets or liability statements to count for all of the cash moving around. If your cash flow is positive, it means sufficient money is available to do operations. If negative, it indicates that the business will require additional funding to keep current operations flowing.This overview is only the start. The next step is deciphering what’s the most important metrics for your business, and building out a financial model based on those metrics.Let’s take a look at the most basic financial metrics you need to be calculating for an online business.SaaS businesses are a specific type of business. SaaS are defined by recurring revenue streams, low cost of sales, and no material product. When keeping track of your financial metrics for a SaaS company, you need to focus on the basic measurements. Then, you need to focus on doing the basic measurements correctly.Every business should start with these metrics as your first set of financial metrics, then you can expand on to secondary calculations after that.Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)Annual Run Rate (ARR)Net Revenue MRR Growth Rate Other Revenue  Quick RatioActive SubscriptionsNew SubscriptionsPlan Quantities UpgradesDowngrades Failed ChargesRefundsCoupons Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)Lifetime Value (LTV)New CustomersActive Customers Churned CustomersReactivationsUser Churn Revenue ChurnNet Revenue ChurnChurned SubscriptionsThis shows you the subscribers who have downgraded from one subscription to a free plan, as well as true cancelations (the people who are no longer paying you). You can see more information about each of these metrics, such as how to calculate them and why you need to know about them here.As well, all of these metrics can be monitored in Baremetrics. You can see each of those metrics right in the side panel on the left hand menu of the UI. Take a look at this graph of active subscriptions right here:The financial metrics that you want to know about for your company highly depend on your industry and type of business. For heavy industry businesses, metrics related to assets such as machinery and logistics will be critical. For SaaS, not so much.For each business, you will need to build a customized financial model that explains exactly which metrics you are focusing on. For SaaS, check out this financial model that you can download and use directly in Sheets. Baremetrics integrates with google sheets so you can easily pipe your data right into your financial model.This financial model was built by a finance consulting agency to specifically cater to SaaS businesses, and the metrics necessary for them. Definitely check it out!As well, the actual names and meanings of metrics can change from industry to industry. For example, Quick Ratio for a brick and mortar commodities company is about comparing your assets and liabilities. For SaaS, the Quick Ratio has a completely different definition. The SaaS Quick Ratio compares growth in MRR from sales, expansions, or reactivations to losses in MRR due to churn.Definitely check out the Baremetrics Academy for more information on financial metrics related to SaaS!Each product or tool will collect information about your metrics in their own way. It is up to the discretion of the analyst to choose a tool that matches the way they want to measure their metrics.For example:Baremetrics has taken tons of considerations like this into account when designing how our metrics are calculated.Reach out to the Baremetrics team for a full description of how our metrics are calculated. Get your Baremetrics free trial and check it out!Not only do you want to have accurate financial metrics, you want to take action on your financial metrics.When there is a failed payment causing reduced churn, you want to have a system in place that reacts and makes sure the proper actions are taken to recover that transaction.You can use the Baremetrics Recover tool to automatically take action on failed payments. This tool will identify failed payments, automatically reach out to the customer with the failed payment, and then get the customer to re-enter their credit card information to make the transaction successful. This saves business owners thousands of dollars a year that typically goes lost and untraced due to the difficulty of keeping track of everything.As well, you want to be able to easily segment, forecast, and monitor the financial behaviour of your customers and expenses.Using the Baremetrics tool for customer segmentation, you can break down your MRR by plan, service type, and any other customized behaviour you track within your app. Check out the graph below which shows revenue segmented by geography. You can easily see the difference between Canadian and British customers, where the revenue from Canadian customers is still growing, but the revenue from British customers has plateaued.Use Baremetrics to not only see your financial metrics, but to power automatic actions and insights based on your financial metrics.Understanding your financial metrics is critical, but the problem extends far beyond the question “which financial metrics should I measure”. You need to be keeping on top of your financial metrics from an operational point of view, and be constantly in touch so data doesn’t get dropped.Then, making the most of your financial metrics is another critical and challenging question.Baremetrics automatically pulls information relating to your finances from your payment gateways and gets all of your financial metrics in one place. Then, Baremetrics powers you to act on your financial data, as well as share and analyze it.Try the Baremetrics free trial now and get all of your financial metrics up on a dashboard today.

      "Price Optimization in SaaS: What Does Churn Tell Us?.\n",
      "Churn is everywhere in the SaaS world. It’s so popular it makes us believe it’s an essential metric to follow. Maybe it is the most important metric. But not everyone is on board with churn. We were inspired by an article written for catch.js about the topic. They demonstrate through simulation experiments that churn, under certain circumstances, will show the opposite of what it should. They argue that churn is useless.We thought we would similarly look at churn. In this article (part four of our Price Optimization series), we will test the churn metric out on simulations to demonstrate when it gives us misleading results. To begin, let’s start with a situation similar to the one in the article mentioned above. The article uses a Lomax distribution to model how long a subscription lasts because it most closely resembles their own customers. They have lots of customers who try their service for a short time, like a few months. They also get a few who stay for much longer. We’ll simulate our subscriptions with the Weibull distribution, with parameters that make it similar to their Lomax model. While many of our Baremetrics customers share a customer base like theirs, some do not. We will also test churn on other kinds of customer bases, modeled from the experiences of our Baremetrics customers. Will churn mislead us in those cases too?Let’s review churn. Here is a formula for customer churn for each period:Churn = customers lost / customers at the beginningThe formula above gives the fraction of customers lost in each time period. If we lose a lot of customers, the fraction increases. If we gain a lot of customers, the fraction decreases, ideally going to zero. Low churn is good, and high churn is bad.It seems simple enough, but if we look closer, we’ll run into problems. Churn doesn’t behave the way we expect.Let’s start with a scenario in which nothing changes: a business where nothing is improving, and nothing is worsening. Sign-ups stay the same. Subscription lifetimes are constant. Revenue is stable as well. This gives us a baseline for comparison later on when something does change. So how does churn behave in a stagnant business?We begin by simulating sign-ups with a Poisson distribution with an average rate of 30 sign-ups per month. We also simulate subscription lengths using a Weibull distribution, with parameters such that the average subscriber subscribes for about 2 months.Let’s watch what happens to the customer base over time in this simulation:The chart above shows the active customer population over time. Notice how our customer base increases at the beginning even though I said “nothing changes.” That’s because we started with zero customers. After about 12 months, we reach a plateau, where sign-ups are in balance with drop-outs. The subscriber population fluctuates but stays near a constant number indicated by the red line. It will continue orbiting this red line forever. This applies to revenue too: we should expect roughly the same revenue, forever. It’s genuinely a stagnant business, neither improving nor deteriorating.Now let’s look at what customer churn does in this scenario. What does stagnant churn look like?Much like the customer population, churn stays constant after sign-ups and drop-outs reach equilibrium. As our customer population grows initially, we notice churn goes down like we would expect, as the proportion of drop-outs decreases relative to the subscribing population. The chart above is what churn looks like when “nothing is happening.” In a stagnant business, there are ups and downs month-to-month because of natural variation. Despite this variation, the average churn is constant, forever. That variation should be a reminder not to freak out when your churn changes month-to-month. Instead, it’s the trend that matters, indicated by the red line in this chart. In this case, it is flat.Now let’s mess it up!What if we shut off sign-ups halfway through this simulation? If we stop getting new subscribers, we would expect churn to increase. Churn is bad, and losing sign-ups is bad, so we hope the two correspond to each other. We expect churn to grow when we fail to retain customers. Does it?Here is what happens to our customer population:Our simulated business grows and is reaching the plateau, just like in the previous example. After that, we stop getting sign-ups (red line). Notice how our subscriber population drops. The drop is steep at the beginning, then becomes flatter as time goes on. This effect comes from an increasing proportion of more loyal customers who remain, who are less likely to churn out. The last customers to unsubscribe are the ones least likely to leave.So does churn ring the alarm bells in this situation? Let’s look at the churn:Now we see something surprising: churn is going down while our business is crashing. It’s the opposite of what we’d expect. We also see the same result in catch.js article even though we used a different distribution to model subscriptions. Why is this happening? It’s because of how subscription lengths are distributed. Not all customers are the same. Some customers will test our services for a month, decide they don’t like them, and unsubscribe. Others will be happy with your product and stay for a long time. Here is a histogram of subscription lengths in the simulation we just did to illustrate:Above is a histogram showing the frequency of various subscription lengths of customers.  Notice it is huge on the left. It means that most of the customers subscribe for a short time. These customers are more likely to unsubscribe at any given time.But on the other hand, there are a smaller number of customers who subscribe for a long time. Those longer subscribers are less likely to unsubscribe, and they stay for a long time.When we shut off sign-ups, mostly the longer subscribers are left. And since they are less likely to leave our business, they are less likely to raise our churn metric. Therefore churn appears to go down while our company is failing. It’s the opposite of what we want.While this may be alarming, this scenario may not apply to all Baremetrics customers. What if we tried this scenario in a different kind of business, with more loyal subscribers?You may notice that the histogram of subscription lengths above does not reflect your own business. It’s an extreme distribution, where the bulk of customers subscribe for a short time. What if your business has fewer short-term customers?Suppose your business attracts customers through sales teams. Your typical customers don’t subscribe for just a month. They subscribe for longer. What does churn look like in that situation when we shut off sign-ups?Now we will simulate based on a real Baremetrics customer. In this business, the average customer subscribes for five years instead of two months. Here is how the subscription lengths are distributed:This scenario has more loyal subscribers.  The typical subscriber will subscribe for three years instead of one month, as in the previous scenario.Now let’s redo the simulation where we shut off subscriptions, but with the new distribution of subscriptions. Here is the chart of active subscribers:It already looks different. The growth of the customer base is steadier. We don’t even reach the plateau before we shut off sign-ups.Now let’s look at the churn:Surprise!  Churn acts more like we should expect: increasing when we are failing to retain our customers. Why is this? It’s because we have fewer customers who churn out quickly and fewer extreme customers who stay longer. This tells us something disturbing about the churn metric. The reliability of the churn metric depends on the kinds of customers you have.Hopefully, these examples will inspire our readers to be more suspicious about the meaning of their churn metrics.Given the strange behavior of the churn metric, it would make more sense to look for better metrics to understand our customer retention. By focusing on churn, we are likely bundling too many processes at once: sign-ups, drop-outs, and the types of subscribers we have. A change in each of these will alter the behavior of churn, but we won’t know what the problem is because the metric bundles these processes.Perhaps it would be better to focus on these processes separately. It is entirely possible to build metrics for sign-ups, drop-outs, and subscription lengths separately.In future posts, we will build these metrics and test them out. We will show how they behave compared to churn. Will the new metrics out-perform churn for customer retention, lifetime value, and revenue calculations? Stay tuned to find out! Thanks for reading!

      "10 Must-Read Books for Startup Founders.\n",
      "The startup world is built on the culture of learning. When entrepreneurs understand the importance of self-development and make it part of their company’s ethos, everybody wins. After all, successful businesses aren’t grown in silos. A proven way to learn new things is to read books by experienced founders. But with so many great books out there, where should you start? We asked the Baremetrics Twitter community for their top recommendations. Here is the list organized in the order they were shared in the comments. Happy reading!Ben Horowitz is a cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley’s most respected entrepreneurs and investors. In The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Horowitz distills years of experience building companies into actionable lessons of leadership. Unlike many business books that try to sell you on what to do right, Horowitz instead acknowledges that screw-ups are inevitable, and details how he and his teams overcame challenges. One of our favorite takeaways: “Take care of the people, products, and profit (in that order).” The Hard Thing About Hard Things was mentioned in our Founder Chats episode with Brian Parks of Bigfoot Capital. Listen to it here!Peter Thiel is a cofounder of PayPal and known for his investments in companies including Facebook, SpaceX, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Yelp and Stripe.Zero to One is Thiel’s guide to thinking about startups in different and often counterintuitive ways. Even if you don’t agree with everything Thiel writes, you’ll appreciate this book as an exercise in rethinking conventional wisdom to imagine products as novel solutions with huge impact. If you work in tech, you likely know Fried and Hansson as the cofounders of Basecamp and industry thought leaders. Not to mention, Hansson is the creator of Ruby on Rails, the web application framework that companies like Airbnb and Crunchbase have used to build their sites. Getting Real is Fried and Hannson’s (and by extension, Basecamp’s) playbook of all things web development. It covers design, programming, marketing, and business practices in thorough, but practical detail. Whether you’re technical or not, anyone working on web-based applications will learn something from this book. Bonus: you can download it online for free. According to Warrillow, the number one mistake entrepreneurs make is building companies that rely way too much on them. In other words, it's bad news if the entrepreneur becomes synonymous with the company. This is a problem because when it comes time to sell the company buyers aren’t confident that it can succeed without the founder. In Built to Sell, Warrillow says entrepreneurs should pursue three criteria- teachable, valuable, repeatable- across company functions to build a sustainable and sellable business. Michael E. Porter is the author of nineteen books, a multiple founder and co-founder, and esteemed Harvard Business School professor.What is Strategy in particular has remained popular among academics and non-academics alike for its position on strategy: operational effectiveness, while important to a company’s growth, is not sufficient because its techniques are easy to imitate. Strategy, he teaches, doing things differently from your competitors to deliver greater value at a lower cost. Note: This article is available only to Harvard Business Review subscribers.Arvid Kahl is a software engineer turned entrepreneur and writer. Zero to Sold details his decade-long journey of bootstrapping, building, and selling Feedback Panda, an edtech SaaS business, in 2019. People love Zero to Sold for a lot of reasons-- one being that it’s relatable. While stories about unicorn companies are certainly exciting, learning from the experience of someone whose circumstances mirror yours is arguably more helpful when it comes to strategy and tactical decision-making.Getting into a habit of reading can have great outcomes for founders and leaders alike. Whether you’re seeking expertise on a specific topic, inspiration to keep going, or just a window into the mind of an entrepreneur you admire, books are an easy way to do so.We hope you found your next great read on this list, and if there’s a title that should be on here, tell us!  \n",
      "What is data enrichment?.\n",
      "Data enrichment is the process of adding value to your already existing data by providing supplementary information and context. The additional data can be retrieved from another data source within the same organisation or a third-party application altogether. For example, suppose your app displays a username or a unique identification number. You can easily refer to the details of the end-user, such as their actual name, associated phone number, and email address. This helps sales and customer success teams communicate with users using their real information. What makes data enrichment so useful is that it gives more insight into the customers you are dealing with. Especially when information is scattered and fragmented, data enrichment plays a key role in producing comprehensive results.Baremetrics is here to enrich the information you know about your customers. You should sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start learning about your customers. At Baremetrics, there are two features that can be used to enrich your customer data. The Baremetrics Tool People Insights packs your customer profiles with information about your customers. This tool will autofill your customer profiles with their location, real names, and emails. It will also make it easy for you to track every charge, failed payment, and transaction history of your customers.The Baremetrics Augmentation tool merges your business metrics with external data so you can see more about your customers. For example, it connects the NPS score a customer gave you with that customer’s profile - so you know exactly how satisfied they are when you talk to them next.You can also correlate the number of times a customer has communicated with support to their NPS score or their churn rate.  There are several third-party tools available for Data Enrichment. The important question before opting for any tool is what kind of data are you looking for? Depending on the type of data you have and your purpose, you will use different tools. For example, if your data is in a spreadsheet, there will be data enrichment tools like Clearbit that can take an input of .csv and return a .csv of fully enriched data.The trouble with that is how to apply the enriched data when it’s in .csv form. If your data is directly in-app, and you are applying it in-app to improve your customer experience, then you may want to use a tool like Baremetrics that can integrate directly with your customer-experience toolkit. It also depends on the type of information you are looking for. For example, if you are developing a food delivery software, then the conventional information about gender or marital status does not make a good targeting parameter. Past purchases or geolocations will help you target your customer better. To get started, let’s look at the different kinds of data you can use to enrich your customer profiles.Identity data refers to data about a person’s identity, such as name, phone number, and email. This kind of “user research” identifies what kinds of people are interested in your products and services. The basic data is usually collected when a user signs up on your website. The alternative way is to use a third-party tool to merge the scattered data across the Internet and make sense of it. For example, pulling emails from public places that match with the name provided.You can easily collect this kind of data on your own by google searching the information related to the individual you want to enrich. However, on a scale of 100s of people, it becomes extremely time-consuming. If you need to do it on a wide scale, we definitely recommend using a tool to get it done!While conventional data pave the way to targeted marketing, it is the socio-economic identifiers such as salary, position, industry, company size, and job title that allow you to really get inside the head of your customer or lead. Being able to identify the area of work someone indirectly affects what you should talk to them about. For example, if you know your contact is in accounting, you'll most likely talking to them about the billing and the consumer contracts of your product. If a free trial earns less than the average salary for a given country, it is unlikely that they will be interested in investing in a premium or a high-end version of your product/service. On the other hand, showcasing a reasonable plan with limited yet exciting features could increase the chances of conversion as money is a limited resource in this scenario. If someone is from a large company, money will likely not be an issue. Such a prospect is more likely to be interested in locking in a 3-years contract at a low monthly cost. Knowing about your prospect’s situation is critical in getting the messaging right.Behavioural data includes information about the customer’s browsing habits, buying habits, and social media activity. Such data helps in assessing a customer’s journey from searching to buying. If we have this information, the targeted communication can then help in more conversions. Eventually, it leads to more profit. The People’s Insights feature offered by Baremetrics serves as an example for this category. It offers customer-rich profiles which track your customers and knows all of their in-app behaviour. People Insights keeps track of failed payments and every transaction made through a customer’s profile. In-app behaviour is extremely important for both sales and customer success. Knowing what your customer is or isn’t doing in-app can lead to better customer care.Now that we have the basic information and the numbers associated with a customer’s account, it is time to find out what opinions your customers hold. This includes any pre-existing bias, reviews or feedback they might have left on social media accounts regarding your products or any similar product in the market. This gives an insight into what their preferences are and how they actually feel about your product.Take the skin-care industry for an example. Lately, the field has been growing at an exponential rate with a wide range of companies and tons of products. Qualitative research about your customers, such as preferred key ingredients by a customer within a product, can be helpful when making recommendations. For instance, someone with an oily acne-prone skin would likely go for a salicylic acid-based product rather than, say, a heavy moisturiser designed for dry skin. While machine learning plays a significant role in extracting the sentiments out of a text or review, the results can be significantly improved if the data we’re starting with is good enough in the first place. This is where qualitative data comes into play.Sign up for the Baremetrics free trial and start seeing more about your customers. While there are a number of third-party applications available on the web, Baremetrics is great for enriching data on anyone who is currently using your app. Baremetrics is a business metrics tool that provides 26 metrics for your business evaluation, such as MRR, ARR, LTV, and more. Baremetrics has further features, such as People Insights and Augmentation. With the People’s Insights feature, you can: 1. Customise user segmentation: Separate the customers based on a given condition, such as location or behaviour.2. Enrich customer profiles: Get notified about your customers’ location, transactions, how active they are, and much more. 3. Handle manual subscriptions: Deleted an instance by accident? You can now add in customers manually, as well as add in customer information manually.In this post, we covered the basics of data enrichment and how you can get started. We also saw different kinds of data and their role in targeted marketing and customer service. Of course, you don’t need to have all four kinds of data to start with. You just need the most relevant ones. Data enrichment is a crucial part of one’s business cycle. Missing or unbalanced data leads to biases with machine learning algorithms which can later be fatal to your business decisions. It is therefore important to start with better, clean data in the first place. By investing in quality data, you are ensuring better performance of these black-box algorithms and hence, a better outcome altogether.With Baremetrics, you are doing more than just adding value to your data. You’re building smart dashboards, control centres, forecasting models, and more. Baremetrics provides Benchmarking tools that let you compare your business within the industry, and Trial Insights improves your conversion rate and track performance.

      "15 SEO Hacks for SaaS Startups.\n",
      "Growing your SaaS company can be difficult in the early stages. Despite this, you’re sitting in a pretty unique situation compared to other business models when it comes to lead generation.  To grow organically through channels like SEO, SaaS businesses are primed for organic search. “SaaS or subscription businesses are based on a product that is neither tangible or limited in its use. It can be modified, updated, improved, and pivoted for a variety of cases and industries. Features can be added in order to create new markets and categories and this gives SaaS companies a unique opportunity to compete in the organic search space with SEO.” (source)In this article, we’ll share 15 hacks to keep in mind when creating SEO content for your startup. To get the most out of your marketing data, utilizing a tool like Baremetrics makes visualization easy and intuitive. Sign up for a free trial today. An easy win on SEO is your page load speed. Page load is significantly influenced by the images on your site, so here are some tips for them: Many marketers underestimate the SEO effect of meta descriptions. They have some significance for both search engines and users. Meta title and meta description can be used for snippets featured in the SERP (but not always, it all depends on the search engine) – and this is what the user sees in the search results. On the other hand, meta descriptions help search engines understand the contents of a page and what the topic is. Finally, meta descriptions can bring your SaaS business more CTR, traffic, and conversions as if they are included in snippets shown in the SERP.If you have not filled out the meta description tag, you lose the opportunity to rank higher, get more conversions and revenue. Therefore, it’s better to check your descriptions, optimize them, and check whether they are displayed properly.Website owners usually use automated tools like a Meta Description Test tool to see whether it’s accurate and engaging. Meta descriptions may include 1-2 target keywords, but using keywords is not crucial for meta descriptions overall. While doing the check, pay attention to such nuances:Speaking of keywords, there’s another field in page settings called meta keywords. But it can be simply ignored. Google and Bing do not rely on meta keywords in their ranking algorithms. Internal links are crucial for SEO since, with this technique, you can point the search robots to the most critical pages on your SaaS website. Inner linking blocks are links to important sections of your site, collected in one block in some part of the page. For example, in the footer, in the document, at the end of an article, or in a sidebar. The main advantage of block interlinking is that a beautifully designed block with several links attracts the user's attention more than a single link in the text:All this has a positive effect on the indexing and ranking of the site. Here’s how Asana, one of the leading SaaS businesses, implements this technique:Another technique that may boost your SEO results is dynamic linking blocks. It is a tactic for replacing anchors in linking blocks when the positions for the keywords used earlier have reached the metrics you need.After making changes on a site, it is worth making sure that the search engine robots have indexed the updated content. Re-crawling can take a couple of days or months. Therefore,  it’s possible to request crawling to speed up the process a little – here’s an example of how to do it in Google:Content is the king for SaaS marketing. First of all, blogs are a great source of organic traffic (if keywords are correctly used). Second, they improve brand awareness and loyalty, helping users better understand your SaaS product, and find answers to their questions.No one will give you as many ideas for quality content as your highly ranked competitors. So, business consultants advise picking a few related businesses with good content marketing and keep an eye on their publications. A nice service to do this is BuzzSumo, for example. It allows users to collect interesting blogs in one place and keep track of their publications to spot content that brings them the most traffic, engagements, and conversions.The following metrics should be analyzed:A content cluster is a way of organizing pages with content, consisting of a parent page, child pages, and the internal links between them.The content clusters are reminiscent of a TV series, with new seasons and different perspectives on the topic constantly appearing.Topic clusters can significantly boost your rankings since they show search engines that all your content is interconnected and provides readers with complete information. For example, topic clusters brought Grammarly over 20 million active users. This leading SaaS company has a Related Articles section, and the articles there are tied to a specific big topic – for example, tips for beginner writers.Google's E.A.T. is for expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. This algorithm ranks sites higher, providing the most truthful, accurate, and expert information. Google strives to deliver the best and proven content to users. Due to lots of fake news and SERP manipulations, Google added E.A.T. and YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) requirements to its Search Quality Rating Guidelines. So, now, if your SaaS site doesn’t provide best-in-class content, as well as reliable and accurate data, it won’t be ranked high and won’t bring you conversions. Sticking to E.A.T. requirements makes sense for all niches, especially if your SaaS business is related to YMYL. These include:Here’s a guide on how to convince search engines of your expertise:Getting to the rich snippet can increase your СTR by 677% and drive much more traffic to your site. As a rule, content that fits search intent the most is more likely to be featured in rich snippets, and that’s good news for SaaS companies. They could target most schema types such as review, how-to, product, video, and FAQ snippets.For example, let’s suppose that your “how-to” articles match the informational intents of visitors. In that case, your site may get more clicks, longer sessions, and higher conversions (since SaaS companies can easily convert readers of their blog to explaining widespread problems and offering solutions in the articles). Anyway, it’s always better to be featured in the rich snippet. To get there, it’s advised to:When your content page is updated and extended in a while, it may be featured in the rich snippet. Also, you can run a Rich Results Test by Google whether your page is designed correctly to be shown as a rich snippet to increase chances. If you have some great-performing text content (blog article, instruction, guide, etc.), you can present it in a video format. First, it will significantly save time on content creation for the marketing team in your SaaS startup since you already know the hot topics for your audience. Second, repurposing content helps to highlight the main points and reach more people. According to Wyzowl, in a year, 87% of video marketers claim that video provides a good ROI. So why not convert your audience with short and useful videos made just in a couple of clicks? There are lots of tools for repurposing content nowadays – like Animoto or Lumen5, for example.The most popular formats for SaaS videos are explainer videos, tutorials, product demos, etc. You can upload them to YouTube (and drive organic traffic from there as well), Pinterest, or just your socials. Videos also increase CTR when the thumbnail is shown in the search results, increase session length and engagement, encourage users to watch other videos, and navigate different sections.If you are still at the beginning of the journey, there is no point in getting to the top of the search results for highly competitive search queries. The trick is to find keywords with decent traffic and low to moderate competition. SaaS startups usually use automated keyword research tools like Google’s Keyword Planner, SE Ranking or Ubersuggest to check the difficulty level, search volume, CPC, and competition metrics. That analysis helps a lot to set up SEO strategy and reach high rankings faster. Below is an example of the dashboard by SE Ranking. Our aim here is to spot keywords that fit our page with moderate difficulty, high search volume, cheap CPC (depends on the target market), and level of competition (number of advertisers bidding on the keyword split to all keywords in the search engine). Your marketing team also can start taking hints from the top-ranking pages in organic SERP to create content that will generate backlinks and make Google raise your page in rankings.Sometimes, there may appear pages that are both ranked for the same keyword on your SaaS site. Or, you run an ads campaign and invest in SEO also for the same keywords. When some of your pages are ranked for the same keyword, there are three different scenarios, and all of them are not beneficial for you:So, to make sure that keyword cannibalization is not your case, it’s better to make on-page SEO audits and remember the basic rule of SEO: one page = one target keywordBacklinks have a direct impact on a site's ranking. The rule is the more reliable sources that link to your site, the better. However, link building should be gradual. It is also necessary to carefully select donors because, in 2021, the quality of the inbound links matters more than quantity. The main metrics to look at when selecting sites to place backlinks for SaaS products are: The Majestic tool may help to analyze your existing backlinks and make sure you are not losing them. Also, it’s possible to analyze your competitors’ backlinks to find effective potential donors. If you’re running a SaaS business, it’s better to be prepared that your competitors may not play nice and use negative SEO to overcome you. Negative SEO is using different unethical and black hat techniques to lower competitor’s rankings in search results. There are lots of such practices, including:One of the most popular negative SEO tactics is to order hundreds of backlinks from pharma, adult, free downloads, and other trash websites. One day, your SEO specialist may wake up and see that your site has many links from absolutely not trusted sites, and it will look like this:To prevent this from happening, it’s advised to constantly audit your website and carefully check the backlinks you receive. If your SEO notices links from unreliable sites that you disagreed with, the usual practice is to write to the owners and ask them to remove the links. Otherwise, they will pretty much ruin your reputation in the eyes of search engines. In addition, the SE Ranking Backlink Checker tool will help to track new backlinks, their anchors, and domain trust.Voice search is now a top trend. Right now, almost half of Internet users aged 16 to 64 already use it to search for something. While one may think that voice search is only used on the go or when the user is very busy with something, many respondents note that they are looking for something this way simply when they are at home alone or with friends, or in the office.So, voice search is now far more than just sudden and urgent searches when someone’s hands are full. If you want to get the advantage of this trend, you should optimize your content and website for voice search. Here are some practices on how to do that:You may target B2B, B2C, or even both in your SaaS business, but it’s crucial to fully understand which markets you want to cover when coming up with your marketing and SEO strategy. So, it’s better to mind these differences: It’s crucial to understand who your customers are (enterprises or individuals) before implementing any changes to your marketing plan. Based on whether your target customers are B2B or B2C, your marketing team can prepare better content, pick more effective keywords according to user intents, and get a higher CTR and result in conversions.Growing your SaaS company using a channel like SEO can serve as the source of (almost) free and hot leads. However, in 2021, it’s not enough to simply collect keywords and insert them throughout the texts. Your marketing team must constantly update your website for higher conversions and revenues, mind technical SEO issues, and work on usability. With our guide, a bit of patience, and a solution to get the most of your marketing metrics, your company will be primed for organic growth.\n"

      "A Guide To Influencer Marketing for Subscription Businesses In 2021.\n",
      "Influencer marketing has effectively taken the world of social media by storm.General users love to see content from influencers, and businesses want to collaborate with influencers to sell their products and services. There are all sorts of ways to optimize your marketing strategy, and influencer marketing is a great way to take your business to the next level. No matter who you are, influencer marketing probably has a pretty significant impact on your social media experience...if not on your life in general.Before going any further you might be thinking, \"how can this strategy be implemented in a SaaS or subscription business?\"With the fairly recent rise in influencer marketing, we realize you likely have some questions about all of the whys and hows of the business. If you’re feeling at all lost or confused, don’t worry.  We get it, and we’re here to help!Keep reading to see our answers to some basic, common questions about influencer marketing and how you can incorporate this in your SaaS or subscription business:Influencer marketing is a promotional tool that businesses employ by collaborating with social media influencers. In these collaborations, influencers receive money and/or free products from the companies they work with. In exchange, the influencers post about the companies and the products/services that they provide. Since influencers have high numbers of followers on their social media accounts, their advertisements for various brands reach a lot of people. This generates more brand awareness and business for companies, especially since people focus so much of their attention on social media. Mega influencers are the influencers who have the highest followings and make the most money. (Shocker, right?)These influencers are commonly categorized as having a minimum of 500,000 to a million followers, which means that many mega influencers are celebrities outside of the realm of social media as well. For example, many mega influencers are popular actors or athletes. In 2021, these influencers typically make around $10,000 per Instagram post. Their services are of high value, since so many audiences are reached by the messages that they publish. So, they are pricey to work with, but if a big-time brand is willing to pay for the advertisement provided by a mega influencer, the resulting benefits are likely to be high.Macro influencers generally fall in the middle of the various levels of influencers, although their audiences are typically on the larger side. These influencers are well-known on social media, especially within the world of influencers. However, they aren’t big-time celebrities like mega influencers are. When an influencer has somewhere between 150,000 and 500,000 followers, they’re classified as a macro influencer. These influencers are great to work with since being an influencer is usually their primary job. This means that they’ll place a lot of focus on advertising your brand. Macro influencers usually make between $5,000 and $10,000 per post on Instagram. Similar to mega influencers, macro influencers can be expensive to work with, but they’ll help you to reach a notably wide audience. Micro influencers appeal to smaller audiences, but they’re known for having more personal pages. Many times, since these influencers target smaller audiences, they go for a more specific niche of followers as well. So, if you’re looking to work with an influencer who impacts a very specific community, a micro influencer could be the way to go (that being said, not all micro influencers target a specific niche).Micro influencers usually have between 1,000 and 100,000 followers. Since these influencers have a smaller number of followers, they’re often known for creating social media pages that are built around community. Micro influencers commonly try to encourage conversation and friendship among their followers as well as taking the time to get to know their followers personally.Micro influencers typically make anywhere between $100 and $500 per Instagram post, so they’re more affordable to work with than mega influencers or macro influencers. If you’re looking to get your brand name out to a significant amount of people, micro influencers can definitely help you do this. And, your brand will likely then be associated with a friendly, community atmosphere. So, we’ve talked about some important details within the world of influencer marketing, but you might still be wondering why you should consider exploring this opportunity. So, let’s take a look at some of the benefits that come from using influencer marketing. It’s pretty obvious from the information in the last section that working with an influencer can help you to get the word out about your brand. The primary goal of social media influencers is to reach wide audiences and promote products and services to these people. So, by having an influencer promote your product or service, you’re putting your brand in the hands of someone who will work hard to make sure that people know about it. No matter which level of influencer you work with, your business will reach the social media feeds of a significant amount of followers. As people begin to see promotions for your brand, they’ll take note of your business, thereby increasing brand awareness for you. As more people hear about your brand and become curious about it, your website and social media pages will begin to see an increase in traffic as well. Just think about it...The more you hear about something, the more interesting you become in finding out more. That means that having an influencer promote your brand will increase awareness of it in the general public. And, an increase in popularity will lead to an increase in sales. Another great benefit to working with influencers is that they often encourage “user generated content” (ugc) among followers. UGC refers to, as you might have guessed, social media content that is created not by influencers, but by general users of sites -- the followers of influencers, in other words. One great example of influencer-promoted UGC is contests that influencers commonly like to host with followers. Let’s say your brand partners with an influencer to promote a new package that you’re selling. The influencer might host a giveaway contest for their followers in order to promote your business and your product. To enter the contest, followers might be required to follow the influencer, follow you, post about your new package on their page, and tag the influencer’s account and your account in the post. Then, they’d be entered in a drawing, and the winner would receive the package for free for a month. Contests and giveaways like these are fabulous forms of advertisement because not only is a popular influencer posting about your brand, but their followers are posting about your brand as well. This means that the followers’ followers will hear about your account, which further increases brand awareness. Additionally, requiring users to follow your brand on social media in order to enter the contest guarantees a boost in followers. This means that you will then have a larger audience to market to on social media, as well. While influencer-hosted contests are certainly effective in increasing traffic on your page, you’ll also see changes in your page traffic and follower count just from having an influencer post about your products and services. When you partner with an influencer, your brand immediately gains credibility. Influencers’ followers trust them to promote brands that they truly like. So, when social media users hear their favorite influencers talking about your brand, instead of seeing a stand-alone advertisement for it, they’ll be more likely to take your brand more seriously. It’s in the name: influencers are there to influence their followers. So, when a trusted social media figure tells their followers to check out your brand, you’re likely to see a notable uptick in traffic on your page. And, if people like what they see, odds are high that they’ll stick around to follow you and learn more about your brand. Influencers are present across various social media apps, but they’re most popular on Instagram and TikTok. So, if you’re looking to work with an influencer for a social media campaign, these apps are a good place to start. If you’re looking to work with influencers on TikTok, there are a couple of ways you can go about finding them. One good way to find an influencer that’s right for your brand is through a TikTok account search on the “discover” page on TikTok.The discover page features a search bar where you can look up accounts by username. This is helpful if you already have some influencers in mind that you’re thinking about working with. Using the same search bar, you can also search for hashtags. This will help you find posts in your niche, which can then lead you to influencers who work with your target audience. Another way to find TikTok influencers is by using a TikTok search engine. There are many different options of TikTok search engines available online, and they all function a bit differently. But, some give you the chance to search for influencers with certain filters such as location or niche.To find influencers on Instagram, we recommend doing a bit of searching on the app. For example, as we mentioned with TikTok, you can search various hashtags on Instagram. By searching a hashtag that applies to your brand or industry, you’ll find all of the posts that have been published with that hashtag. From here, you can look through the most popular posts and find influencers that work with your primary audience. You can also look into the Instagram influencers that have previously partnered with brands in your industry. By finding previous Instagram influencer marketing campaigns within your niche, you’ll be able to get an idea for how a particular influencer works and whether you’re interested in contacting them.When considering which influencer you’d like to work with, there are a few important things that you should take into consideration. It’s an important decision, and you want to make sure that you make the best choice for the success of your brand. The first factor that you should consider when looking into various influencers is whether an influencer has the same target audience that your brand has. As we’ve touched on already, it’s important for an influencer to promote your products/services to people who will be interested in purchasing them. So, the first thing you should do is ensure that an influencer works in the same niche as you. Next, you’ll want to take prices into account. We threw out some general price ranges earlier, but exact price points will vary for each influencer. And, those numbers were for Instagram. TikTok prices tend to fluctuate more between influencers, since the influencer market is newer on that app. To find more specific pricing guidelines, you can always use an Instagram or TikTok money calculator.Finally, ask yourself what kind of partnership you’re looking for. There are many ways to go about working with an influencer and running an influencer marketing campaign...Do you want to send free products for the influencer to sample and promote? Would you like to purchase one post for an influencer to advertise your product? Do you envision an ongoing relationship? Make sure you have clear goals for the partnership and its outcome before you begin conversations with an influencer. This will allow you to start off your working relationship on the same page and work together toward success.  Now that we’ve covered the information you need on how and why to start an influencer marketing campaign, let’s take a quick look at some examples of subscription businesses that have successfully partnered with influencers:HelloFresh is a meal-prep kit subscription service through which customers sign up to regularly receive ready-to-cook meals. In this partnership with TikTok influencer @acooknamedmatt, Chef Matt Broussard receives HelloFresh boxes and then films TikTok videos as he cooks the meals inside.Not only does Chef Matt promote the subscription service through these fun videos, his caption also tells viewers that, through the link in his bio, they can subscribe to Hello Fresh at a discounted rate. This promotion further incentivizes followers to purchase the subscription. In this influencer marketing campaign, the Dollar Shave Club subscription service partnered with Instagram micro influencer @ashleymariex24. As noted on the post itself, this is a paid partnership, which means that Ash was paid to publish this promotional post for the service. In the photo, she’s shown using Dollar Shave Club products, and her caption invites all followers to try out the brand. Ash specifically calls on men and women to use the product, so it’s clear that the partnering brand wanted this influencer marketing campaign to appeal to all audiences, rather than specifically to female or male followers.This IPSY partnership with TikTok macro influencer @avani is an example of a different style of influencer marketing. Since Avani is such a well-known figure, it makes sense that she partnered with a large brand such as IPSY. In her video, Avani shows viewers what she received in her latest shipment from the makeup subscription service. This post is a great example of a giveaway hosted through a brand-influencer partnership. As seen in the caption, Avani is advertising a free, yearlong subscription to IPSY, and she lays out the requirements to enter. So, there you have it: our best guide to influencer marketing as it pertains to subscription businesses.Now you know why it’s so important to collaborate with social media influencers and how you can get started on designing a social media campaign through an influencer partnership. We hope that these tips and examples will inspire you to get a jumpstart on your social media campaign, and we’d love to hear all about whatever you end up creating! So, if you find this info helpful and you decide to work with an influencer, come back and tell us all about it -- we’d love to hear how it goes! \n"

      "How to Migrate Customer Data from PayPal to Stripe: Everything You Need to Know.\n",
      "Joseph Anderson is the Founder and CEO of Sync with Connex, a SaaS company that automates data entry between QuickBooks and online e-commerce channels. After using PayPal for payment processing for 10 years, he decided to switch to Stripe’s platform. He decided to migrate from PayPal to Stripe because PayPal’s software and data reporting were insufficient for Sync with Connex’s needs. With Stripe, Joseph gained developer-friendly features and the ability to integrate with third-party applications like Baremetrics for smarter analytics. In this guide, he explains how Sync with Connex successfully handled a full PayPal to Stripe migration, including the code he used to edit specific subscription information, create subscriptions, and update customers after they had been imported to Stripe. Although Stripe and PayPal are both payment gateways, they are very different tools. The attributes of a customer in Stripe are different from how they’re organized in PayPal.Because of this, Sync with Connex completed the migration by the following process: This article will explain exactly how Sync with Connex accomplished these steps, starting with important learnings to be aware of before getting started. As Sync with Connex migrated from PayPal to Stripe, they overcame a number of challenges to get their existing customer data to fit into Stripe’s environment.Subscription Information  If your business offers different products with different subscription tiers, you will be able to see which product each customer is signed up for, but not the subscription tier. Rather, you must edit your Stripe accounts by manually importing a spreadsheet of RP numbers (this is what PayPal calls customer IDs), their new Stripe Price ID, the member since date, the next payment date, and payment frequency (monthly / yearly).Legacy Pricing Some Sync with Connex users have legacy pricing. The logic Sync with Connex used said that “If the “member since date” was prior to 6/1/2019, then choose the legacy Price ID. Otherwise, use the new Price ID.” When you make your spreadsheet to import, ensure the price ID is accurate for legacy users. Stripe allows the same product to contain multiple price points.Billing and Shipping AddressesTo add billing details, you must manually import them using a spreadsheet of RP numbers, phone, email and billing address. To create this spreadsheet, head to PayPal Manager. Go to Reports and generate a Custom Report. Make sure to include all of the fields you need. The “Comment 2” field contains the RP number. If you don’t have Price IDs in Stripe, you will need to create them. This means creating new Price IDs that match with your existing PayPal products. Sync with Connex did this by creating specific codes, which they call SKUs, for each product. Using SKUs made it easier to map these products to Stripe Price IDs, as Connex’s product names have changed over the years. Then, they wrote code to match these SKUs to a list in Stripe. After exporting the SKUs from PayPal into a spreadsheet, Sync with Connex created a Meta field called SKU. Then, their custom code mapped the PayPal SKU information into new Stripe Price IDs via the Stripe Price ID SKU meta field. For more information on how to map PayPal fields to Stripe, keep reading. To see their code, you can find it towards the end of this article. To import credit card information from PayPal to Stripe, you can easily export to Stripe via customers’ PayPal profile ID. However, this can be difficult to do accurately at scale. In Sync with Connex’s experience, during the migration a miscommunication caused Stripe to receive transaction IDs when they should have received PayPal Profile IDs. This was a problem because transaction IDs would not have properly recognized the differences in payment schedules for Sync with Connex customers; some customers pay monthly, whereas others pay annually. This miscommunication resulted in a 2-week delay.If you deactivate a customer in PayPal before migrating everything to Stripe, not only will their information not appear in Stripe, you won’t be able to reactivate their profile in the future. As a workaround, you can use parallel programming to import them in batches.Before we migrate the custom data, let’s take a look at how the fields map from PayPal to Stripe.This is the information that will import automatically when working with Stripe's migration team:As discussed earlier, Stripe will only import the customer name, email, and payment method. Information such as previous payment data, plan information, customer name, and billing details will not be imported from PayPal to Stripe. Below is an example of a customer account immediately after the migration. Note the absence of subscriptions and payment history. After the initial export into Stripe, Sync with Connex used the Stripe and PayPal APIs to further modify customer information in Stripe.The method that he used is as follows:Here is code for importing the users:As mentioned earlier, if you don’t have Price IDs in Stripe, you’ll need to create them.Sync with Connex’s method was to map a spreadsheet of product SKUs (their way of labeling different products) and Stripe Price IDsIn the code below, you’ll see the SKUs and their Price IDs: . It’s imperative to find the right payment processor for your business needs. For Sync with Connex, Stripe was the smarter choice because of its advanced billing capabilities, simple integrations, and tools built for developers. But processing payments is only the first step. SaaS and subscription businesses need to understand metrics like MRR, ARR, LTV, and more in order to accurately understand the health of their business and forecast growth. Sync with Connex uses Baremetrics to stay on top of key metrics, as well as recover failed payments and better understand why customers cancel subscriptions. To learn more about how Sync with Connex used Baremetrics to recover over $11,000 in failed payments in just 4 weeks, check out their story here. Joseph Anderson is the Founder and CEO of Sync with Connex, a SaaS company that automates data entry between QuickBooks and online selling channels.

      "10 Scalable Ways to Improve SaaS Customer Success.\n",
      "“Do customer success” is the startup equivalent of “eat less and exercise.” Good for everyone, but also vague and hard to implement. Of course, you’d like to talk to each individual customer and make them successful. But dedicated customer success teams are a privilege of bigger SaaS companies. What can you do as a small team with limited resources?You may be already spending time on individual demos and onboarding calls, and that’s a great foundation for customer success. But there are smarter ways to scale your efforts and use your time.In this article, you’ll find ten actionable recommendations that will improve your customer success setup — guaranteed! — without hiring more people.Sadly, many founders just fly blind: let users sign up, and pray for the best. But before you introduce any improvements, start measuring what you currently have. The key is to understand where the users are in their journey.It doesn’t have to be mind-blowing analytics. We recommend just a few success metrics (properties) that reflect user progress. For example, if you run a photo editing product, you could measure the number of photos or albums inside the account.If your volume of users is high and you can’t review every customer — which is common for B2C or freemium products — then use behavioral segmentation to see behavior patterns at scale.It’s helpful to measure engagement across entire accounts, not just individual users. Sometimes a single user may show no activity, while the account is doing really well because other team members are doing the work.Recommended tools: You can use a simple in-house admin dashboard, or forward customer data into another tool for analytics or behavior-based automation. For example, Userlist is an email automation tool, but it also helps you track users’ progress and segment them.A video walkthrough of your product is a great supplement for individual demo calls. Too often, we sacrifice our precious hours for demos, without realizing that the other party might not want it either. A potential customer might simply want to check out the key features, without disrupting their schedule — not to mention people who aren’t comfortable about calls altogether.And we don’t mean a 2-minute explainer animation. Instead, share your screen and properly show how your product works. It won’t be hard if you’ve already done your fair share of demo calls. It will also take less time than your average 30-minute demo — you can show a lot in just 5-10 minutes. A massive timesaver for you and your prospects!This does not mean you should eliminate your one-on-one sales calls — you can offer both options alongside each other. There a few ways to add such video:We added a pre-recorded 10-minute demo webinar at Userlist recently, and have been steadily collecting high-quality emails. We’re still doing high-touch demo calls, but the number of them is more manageable.This is another way to scale your customer communications. Instead of inviting prospects to an individual call, invite them to a group call that happens 1-2 times per week.Sure, it might not work for everyone for timezone reasons, but those will be mere exceptions.Here’s what you can do as group calls:Recommended tools: Zoom, Crowdcast, Livestorm, StreemYard, or any other software for group meetings or webinars. Calendly or SavvyCal for scheduling.It may seem that “request access” CTA is typical for early-stage products, but it can be a powerful customer success instrument at any stage. Ashutosh Priyadarshy, founder of Sunsama, swears by their onboarding questionnaire. It helps them qualify their customers, set expectations, and gets them into the right mindset. In addition to some fact-checking, they include sales-driven questions like these:Instead of a vague invitation to “book a time” with you, set up several specific event types. This will make your meetings more focused and result-driven. You can assign these call types to different team members, leveraging their skills and helping niche specialists (like engineers) to avoid unnecessary calls.Here are some examples:Recommended tools: Calendly, SavvyCal, or any other calendar tool for scheduling. Zoom for video calls.Help resources come in many shapes and sizes, and they shouldn’t be limited to your help docs. Over time, you’ll have a variety of materials in your content library, and use them depending on the situation. Should you have your best resources locked behind an email opt-in? Sure thing, you can repurpose them as lead magnets to grow your email list. But don’t be afraid to distribute content freely in other situations, when it’s more important to help the user than to collect their email address.Here are some of the formats:Any of the above can exist in the shape of text, video, audio — just start with the media you’re comfortable with.Podcasts deserve a special mention. Not only are they great for authority and education, but they also help you consistently have in-depth conversations with experts or customers. At Userlist, we run a show called Better Done Than Perfect, which has been a continuous source of inspiration. In fact, our season two was dedicated to customer success, and many of the ideas in this article were inspired by these conversations.With reasonable engineering effort, you can display help articles or videos inside your product (as a sidebar, or inline). Jason Forrest, the founder of Rigbooks, offers a feedback field on every screen of their tool. They ask, “How can we make this screen better?” According to Jason, customers use the form often, and he’s been able to collect valuable feedback this way.Of course, in-product methods include onboarding tooltips, tours, and in-app notifications. While not a silver bullet, they can certainly help for specific products.Recommended tools: Chameleon, Appcues, Userpilot for tooltips and tours. Userlist for in-app notifications.Nobody likes to start from scratch. For certain SaaS companies, templates are the core part of their business. At Snappa, a design tool, each template is a result of collaborative effort between a designer and a social media specialist. They look at popular brands and their social media accounts to understand the trends, and then implement similar layouts as templates.You can also pre-populate blank accounts with default content. This way, the user can see an example “in its natural habitat,” and customize existing content instead of starting from scratch.Don’t have access to engineering resources? Do not worry. You can provide templates as downloads or shared documents — swipe files, spreadsheets, Notion databases.Up to this point, we’ve been discussing various resources or events you can offer to your customer. However, you can’t count on your users to discover them on your own. The backbone of your user onboarding should be automated messaging. It will suggest relevant resources to your new customers, depending on what they do (or don’t do) inside your product.There are different levels of complexity, but any option is better than doing nothing. Here’s what you can do:While user onboarding is the most important part of the customer journey, your customer success efforts shouldn’t stop there. You can offer a variety of engagements throughout the customer lifecycle. We recommend to balance asking the user for favors vs offering them help. Counterintuitively, a favore done for you can also strengthen the bond between the customer and your product.Things to ask for:Things to offer:Larger teams have dedicated customer success specialists who can offer these engagements manually. At scale, you can use the same automation setup to initiate various interactions — including high-touch ones — throughout the customer lifecycle.There’s so much you can do for your SaaS customers, and so little time. If we could give one piece of advice, it would be “start simple.”It’s impossible to achieve a perfect setup from day one. But any effort counts. Execute first, optimize later. Good luck, and onwards!\n"

      "5 Best Financial Projection Software to Consider in 2022.\n",
      "One of the hardest jobs of any CFO, controller, or senior financial analyst is to look towards the future and make predictions about the business. It’s also one of their most important functions because every high-level decision requires some understanding about what will happen in the future. While financial modeling can be done by hand in Excel, the results won’t be as accurate or timely. That’s why most companies invest heavily in financial projection software.But, what do you need in your financial projection software? Which software package is best? What kind of investment does top-rate financial projection software entail? These are just some of the questions we’ll answer in this article. Financial forecasting is the art of predicting the future based on current trends. A skilled analyst will select a financial model that matches the data available and make inferences about the future based on its projections. The problem with looking into the future is that it is uncertain. We don’t have access to a crystal ball, which means we need to make assumptions. A seasoned manager is going to make better assumptions than most, but it is still never going to line up exactly with reality.This is where scenario planning comes in handy. Scenario planning is a way to remove uncertainty by building multiple visions of the future and then modeling all of them. If done correctly, you’ll be able to watch the forecast over the coming weeks and match the predictions to what is actually happening and figure out which scenario is the most accurate.For example, if your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) has been steadily rising month on month, you might make a baseline model where your MRR continues to rise by 5% over the next year. Then, you’ll probably want to build a second conservative scenario with flat MRR over the next year to see how your company will fare without growth. Finally, you should include a more aggressive scenario with a 10% increase in MRR so you have a plan in place if your company outperforms expectations.This is where financial projection software really comes in handy. If it takes you 50 hours to build a single model, then you can have it done next week. However, if you have five key variables and three options for each of them, then you’ll need (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 =) 12,150 hours to finish all of the models. Needless to say, you can’t spend six years running your annual financial models!As mentioned above, the best models are accurate and timely. You need good information to make decisions about the future, but you also need information at the right time to make those decisions. Financial projection software helps businesses plan their resources in support of their future activities. It helps companies estimate their future revenue and expenses. Good software can help every department of a company.For instance, a manager or top-level executive might use financial projection software for departmental budgets and financial forecasts. An accountant can use these tools to consolidate budgets across departments and draw up income and cash flow statements for the year ahead. The HR department can even use it to build a hiring plan that won’t break the budget.On its face, financial projection software may seem like a generic solution—don't all accounting tools offer a budgeting feature? While financial forecasting is one of the core functions of accountancy, it is often the forgotten one by accounting software. That’s just one of the reasons you’ll need a separate financial projection software solution. What you need in your financial projection software will depend on many factors, from the size and complexity of your business to how much influence macroeconomics has on the demand for your products. However, here is a list of some things you might want to have in your product:Pull data directly from your accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks)Able to input data directly or upload from data files (e.g., xlsx and clv files)Automatic scenario and projection optionsManual scenario and projection optionsTransparent projection functions that show you which data is being used wherePulls information from the income statement and balance sheet to automatically create cash flow projectionsAdded features to monitor changes in revenue and expenses (e.g., revenue recognition and hiring plans)High-quality data visualizations including graphics and charts to make trends clearerThe five financial projection software packages below meet most or all of the above requirements. That’s important because a robust software package can help you do the following:Fine-tune your business planProduce various budget templatesMaintain multiple budget versionsKeep track of historical budgets to help with future forecastingCompare forecasted revenue and expenses with actual figuresCombine budgets across departments for company-wide cash flow forecastingPlan for what ifs in the event of budgetary changesKeep watch over budgeting process performanceHere are five of the best financial projection software packages available today.Flightpath is a full-service financial modeling software solution.

      "Price Optimization in SaaS: Why You Should Experiment & What Data to Use.\n",
      "Everyone should be interested in using their data to optimize their SaaS pricing. After all, finding the right pricing is one of the best opportunities for revenue growth in our industry. But what if I said you need to start our data collection over again from scratch, years after launch? What if I told you to stop working with your old data and commit to six months of carefully controlled data collection in the interest of price optimization? Many would balk at the notion. If you have a dashboard and data, why can't you use that information for price optimization experiments?The short answer is that if we use old data for price optimization, any insights we find are probably noise.To get a reliable signal for our price optimization, we need to collect data in a structured way. If we plan our data collection carefully, our  experiment avoids wasting resources on inconclusive results.This article (part three of our Price Optimization series) will explain in detail why experiments are key for finding the best price, and what data you to run experiments correctly. Pricing a SaaS product is hard, especially when your company is first starting out. The good news is that after some initial sales, you can start collecting data to run experiments and collect actionable data. Let’s look at an example. Below is an MRR plot from a real Baremetrics customer in its first two years:We can use this data to gather insights on a relationship between our price and sign-up rates. Spoiler alert: something is going to go wrong!This business owner launches at a low price, $25/month, then raises the price twice: first to $39/month, then finally to $45/month.Maybe the strategy this business owner followed was to increase the price until something bad happens. Whatever the strategy, for it to help optimize our revenue, we need a KPI by which to judge which price is better. For our purposes, to find the best price we will look at what happened to sign-up rates when we raised the price.Baremetrics offers powerful reporting tools that make it easy to track important metrics and KPIs. Get your free trial here. How do we compare the sign-up rates between these price points? We can assume if we raise the price, there will be fewer signups, but by how much? Let's try plugging the data into a simple statistical model to estimate monthly signup rates. For the curious, this is a Poisson model which we will discuss more in future posts.This model uses data in the form of sign-up counts per month. For now, all we need to know is that data points get put into the model, and an estimate for sign-up rates comes out.The above shows estimates for the sign-up rates at each price point. The error bars show uncertainty about the estimate (95% confidence intervals).What does it tell us?Now that we've compared sign-up rates, we can explore what this implies for revenue.To get revenue estimates, we multiply the sign-up rates by the expected lifetime of a customer. In this dataset, that's 49.8 months (to see more of how we got this number, check out our previous article about customer retention!)Then we multiply this by the price:Now, let’s transform the Poisson regression results using the formula. This allows us to compare these groups by their total revenue, as shown in the below chart: Note that now, even the lowest price group (in blue) overlaps with the highest price!Overlapping error bars mean our model doesn’t know which price gives the most revenue, they may even be the same!Simply put, we spent two years collecting data on our prices, and we still don't know which one is better for revenue. What went wrong here?For one, we couldn't distinguish our prices because we didn't collect enough data. The error bars are so large, they overlap. With more data, we would get tighter error bars, which would allow us to distinguish the prices.Take, for example, the error bar for $25/month (blue). It's much bigger than the others. If we had more data on $25/month, the error bar would be smaller, and we could tell with greater certainty whether it's different or not.Let's look at how many days we gave to each price:Lack of data wasn't our only problem. To see what else is wrong, let’s look at the data from a different perspective. Here’s the data as a time series:If you are intimidated by the challenges we faced here, don't fret! Our next articles will discuss the methods we use to work around these problems. We will discuss ideas about planning experiments that truly offer actionable insights.

      "Financial forecasting models are used to help businesses predict the future. Different types of financial forecasting models perform best depending on the events you are trying to predict, the types of data you have on hand, and the level of precision you need. Knowing how to use multiple different forecasting models, as well as when each is going to work best, is an important part of upping your analytics game. In this article, we'll have a closer look at five different financial forecasting models and present examples of use cases.First, it is important to distinguish between the terms “financial forecasting” and “financial marketing” to understand exactly how they work together.Forecasting and modeling are different but related functions. They are often used interchangeably because they are done by the same people, with the same information, and the same goal in mind. Financial forecasting is usually done by the CFO or controller. First, they take all the current internal trends, such as revenue growth, and external ones, such as market conditions and changes in consumer behavior. Then, they use this information to make predictions about the future. That’s really it. Just like “weather forecasting” is predicting whether it will be sunny or rainy tomorrow, “financial forecasting” is predicting whether sales will go up or down.If financial forecasting is the “why,” then financial modeling is the “how.” Companies want to have an idea about the future so they can make strategic decisions that benefit their bottom line. The best way to get accurate, actionable information about the future is to use a financial model. A company must have an idea of how things are going to be able to react to changes in the marketplace. Anticipating new opportunities is the best way to benefit from them. Seeing problems on the horizon is the only way to navigate around them. For example, if you are seeing a market downturn coming, then you might want to improve your cash position so that you can survive the next few months. If you are seeing huge growth happening, then you’ll want to update your hiring plan.The simple answer to this question is uncertainty. If you are unsure about how the market is going to change in the coming months or years, then you need create models to see how your company would fare under different scenarios. Financial models allow you to work with your uncertainty about the future to improve your financial forecasting.The best financial model changes based on what information you have, how you want to use the model, and what you are trying to predict. Here are five financial forecasting models to help you drive business growth.This model can come in handy when you want to evaluate a new opportunity and you have no historical data to base your predictions on.A top-down forecasting model can use the size of a new market as a point of departure and then make a forecast by estimating how much market share your business will be able to grab.You are thinking about building a new SaaS product but are unsure of how big the market could be. Start by looking at the total addressable market (TAM). That’s how much the market is worth in total. Then, you look at market share. If there is a major player in the market, then it can be a lot harder to grow your market share. If the market is dominated by many smaller players, then it is easier to build your share of the market.Finally, you take the market share you think you can attain and multiply it by the TAM to predict your future revenue. If it is greater than your expected costs building and launching the product, as well as acquiring customers, then you have a good opportunity.If you have access to historical sales data or financial statements, it makes sense to go about your forecasting from the bottom-up. Then, you use your existing sales numbers and cash flow statements as the input for calculating future scenarios.This method will usually be more accurate and more detailed since you are working with actual numbers, so you reduce the assumptions. You have 200 customers currently. You are currently charging $25/month for your product. You are seeing 5 customers churn and 10 customers sign up monthly. You can use this to see that your current revenue is 200 × $25 = $5,000 and will increase by 5 × $25 = $125 per month.The Delphi method is a model where you get your forecast from a group of experts, leveraging a facilitator and continuously collaboratively iterating on hypotheses and analyses to reach a consensus opinion.Questionnaires, surveys, and focus groups form the basis of this process, where every round builds on the previous iteration. This is an efficient way to make sure the entire group gets access to all information.Your product is stagnating at an MRR of $10,000. You’ve updated your platform with new features a few times, but your current customers do not seem willing to pay more and it is getting harder to find new customers.You decide to hire a consulting firm with experts in the field to conduct a series of focus groups with your current customers, prospects, and influential people in the field. After each round of focus groups, the experts present their findings. You take these findings as the basis for making changes and report them back to the consultants. They then conduct another round of focus groups, bring you their recommendations and you try them out. This continues until the problem is solved.Another way to look at financial forecasting is to identify correlating variables and track how they follow each other. The rise of big data makes this a possibility for even smaller firms.This way of predicting financial outcomes can help decision-makers make forecasts based on the relationships between prices and costs, supply and demand, and other factors that affect each other.While correlation-based forecasting is traditionally done in an academic setting, there are many ways to use this system in your company. You want to start a new paid marketing campaign. While you understand who your buyers are when they are acting as a customer, you want to see if there are other behaviors that might help improve your sales campaign. Going deeper into your buyer personas, you see that members of your customer demographics tend to share funny memes. You reorient your social media advertising to be “funny” and “viral” in hopes that they will be shared more in private messages, which can help build social proof for your product.Statistical models (also called quantitative forecasting models) create relationships between the findings of other disciplines. This can help you figure out how your operation compares to other similar businesses, i.e. benchmarking. Your growth rate is going exponential. You know this can’t last, but you want to have a better idea of when the exponential growth period will end so you don’t over hire. You gather data from two main sources. First, you find the trends in the market growth over the last 20 years as well as expert opinions on how it will grow over the next 10 years. Second, you use public data to track how your more established competitors grew over that same period to see when their growth curves started to level off.Then, you use some statistical models to “fit” the growth rates of your competitors to the growth rate of the model to make inferences about how long your company will enjoy exponential growth. Companies want to have a better idea about how the future of their market and business will change. That’s the “why” of financial planning. Companies do not have good information on what will happen in the future so need to use financial models to help predict the future. That’s the “how” of financial planning. Gathering as much data as possible is the first step in creating a sound financial forecasting model. This information can be found internally on your balance sheet and income statement or externally from the news.Then, you need to track down all of the uncertainties in your future and find ways to eliminate them. This is usually done through running multiple scenarios. Finally, you need to select the right type of model. The right model is the one that can be used with the data you have on hand. Does this sound overwhelming? Flightpath by Baremetrics can do all of this for you and more. You should sign up for a demo today.\n"

      "Stripe vs Adyen: Features, Pricing, Reviews, and More.\n",
      "Payment processors are the backbone of ecommerce. Without them, companies couldn’t accept payments for goods online. Two of the biggest names in payment processing are Stripe and Adyen. Stripe, founded in 2010, is one of the largest payment processors, second only to PayPal. Adyen has been around a bit longer, but it is still a relatively small company. Both boast great customer service reputations and a host of features along with “simple” payment processing.So, how do you choose? Here's a side-by-side comparison of Stripe vs. Adyen so you can see how they stack up. Whichever you choose, know that Baremetrics can provide powerful data analytics for both platforms. Before we jump into this head-to-head Stripe vs. Adyen comparison, you need to have a basic understanding about how payments are processed online. While this section reviews all the needed terminology, we encourage you to take a look at our dedicated article on payment processors for a complete understanding of this process.First, there are three main entities involved in every transaction online:The payment processor essentially coordinates everything between the buyer and seller. When you buy something online, it might seem like your money is just sent to the shop but that is far from the case. Since fraud is rampant, product returns happen, and companies and consumers are located around the globe, there are a dozen interactions that take place within a few milliseconds.These interactions help prove that the credit card holder is legitimate and can afford the product, the seller is legitimate and has the product to sell, the merchant and sending banks are allowed to work together, and so much more. At a fundamental level, the payment processor is tasked with not only making ecommerce possible but also fast, safe, seamless, and simple. That’s what is at stake when you are considering Stripe vs. Adyen for your business.Before we dig into the specifics of what both these service providers offer, let’s take a quick look at each brand and its core focus.With industry-leading tools that developers love, it didn't take long for Stripe to make a name for itself. Interestingly, Stripe has also taken the approach of being an all-in-one ecommerce solution, which means they have a lot of features for marketplace and subscription payments. One drawback of Stripe is that its analytics platform is limited. If you are focused on growth, you’ll need a separate growth metrics dashboard.Like Stripe, Adyen also strives to be an all-in-one solution. Unlike Stripe, Adyen isn't a third-party payment processor but rather a merchant account provider. This means you'll face extra sign-up steps in order to start using the platform because they're actually giving you a dedicated merchant account. Compare this to Stripe, which accepts payments on your behalf and then transfers them into your accounts elsewhere.Adyen allows you to accept all types of debit and credit cards along with ACH, electronic payments, Google Pay, Apple Pay, local payments, and international payments. Adyen doesn’t need to transfer the money to an outside merchant account. Instead, the money goes directly into your Adyen merchant account where you can access and manage it. Comparing the features of these services side-by-side is important in making your decision. Here are summary lists of the features offered by Stripe vs. Adyen.Furthermore, Stripe users enjoy the following benefits: In addition to these feature, Adyen offers these highlights: When you're dealing with money, knowing exactly what fees you're responsible for is extremely important. Fortunately, unlike a lot of merchant account providers, Stripe and Adyen are very transparent.Stripe charges per payment, and it is usually a combination of a nominal fee plus a percentage.In addition to their per-payment charges, Stripe offers many other services that come with their own fees. For example, Stripe can perform your revenue recognition functions or allow you to issue credit cards.Adyen’s fee structure is quite different from that of Stripe. First, there is a minimum monthly invoice of $120, which makes it less budget friendly to smaller companies. Second, they split their fee into a processing fee, currently $0.12 for all payment methods in America, and a payment method fee, which varies by the payment method. Here are a couple examples:Interchange++ is Adyen’s attempt to save customers money at the expense of making pricing a bit more complicated. Basically, different companies and different situations charge different amounts for each transaction. Most payment processors level these fees by charging a different amount for each transaction. For example, if three situations have total fees of 1.5%, 1%, and 1.8%, most payment processors would add 1%, 1.5%, and 0.7%, respectively, to make all transactions cost 2.5% in total. Adyen doesn’t do this. For a full explanation, please take a look at their explanation.Stripe has an overall 4.7/5 on Capterra, while Adyen has a 5/5. However, Stripe has received over 2000 reviews whereas Adyen has only 6.Customer reviews for Stripe are overwhelmingly positive. Customers are most positive about how easy Stripe is to use, how quickly it can be deployed, and how mobile-friendly the service is. Here are some highlights from the reviews: “I like that the system is easy to use on your mobile device” - Capterra user“It is easy to use. Fast to set up and you can start receiving payments right away.” - Capterra userOne common and legitimate complaint is about the price. However, payment processors have been charging more and more for years, so keep in mind that this issue isn’t Stripe-specific.“It’s expensive. The fees are just too expensive for my organizations. I used the software with give lively which is free but the Stripe fee was not worth it.” - Capterra userReviews for Adyen are also mostly positive. “I have been using Adyen for a while now and I am very happy with their performance. It is ideal for international merchants as it support transactions in multiple payments (hosted payments, local card etc) and it is easy to personalize the platform by setting your own rules.” - Capterra userThe downside of Adyen is its minimum monthly charge. If you do not manage a lot of transactions, or your transactions are small, then you will likely be overpaying for their service at $120/month.“It is not convenient for businesses that do not manage a big number of transactions as it can be expensive.” - Capterra userAnother issue that Adyen shares with Stripe is that its analytics are not sufficient for a modern, growth-oriented company.“The reporting tools are not very developed and it would be nice to have more options to personalize the reports or gather the necessary information without struggles.” - Capterra userStripe and Adyen both deserve your consideration if you're looking for a payment processor to handle your online transactions. Let’s review some key takeaways for each. Stripe is recommended for companies of all sizes, especially smaller companies looking for a quick set-up process and sell mostly in North America, Europe, and Asia. Stripe is also very developer-friendly, which may be challenging for people with non-technical backgrounds. Adyen, on the other hand, is built for larger companies in specific regions. They do not offer self-service onboarding, and is only available in North America, Europe, Australia, and Singapore. Both platforms excel as payment processors. However, the analytics capabilities these platforms provide simply don't cut it for many growing startups.Baremetrics is the leading subscription analytics solution for Stripe and Adyen users. Our platform integrates with payment processors and calculates the most important SaaS metrics and trends to support smarter growth.

      "Cancel Timeshare Recovered $680 in 1 Month With Baremetrics.\n",
      "RESULTSWithin just one month of using Baremetrics, Cancel Timeshare has saved hours of manual entry, recovered over $680 in failed payments, and supported their customer service goals.Cancel Timeshare is a Myrtle Beach based company with a mission to help people regain financial freedom when they want to leave a timeshare. They guide timeshare owners through the timeshare exit process with transparent service and fair pricing. Since launching in January 2020, Cancel Timeshare has helped return over 4 million dollars to its clients. Their team uses Baremetrics to keep track of important business metrics like MRR, stay on top of failed payments, and organize customer information. Cancel Timeshare offers two services: Timeshare Exit (for people who are leaving timeshares that are already paid off) and Timeshare Mortgage Intervention (for people with timeshares that are currently being financed). The Cancel Timeshare online site and mobile app allows clients to easily submit documents, as well as keep track of their case’s progress. With over 10 years experience of helping people exit timeshares, Cancel Timeshare drives proven results in an industry fraught with scams and dishonest practices. Baremetrics chatted with Cancel Timeshare President Charles Howard to learn more about how they use Baremetrics to integrate Stripe data, recover failed payments, and provide top-notch customer service. A timeshare is an ownership model for vacation real estate. Instead of a singular owner, timeshares involve multiple people owning allotted usage at the same property, usually in 1-week increments. Timeshares are appealing for several reasons. Unlike a traditional vacation home which may sit vacant for most of the year, timeshare owners pay less to use only their allotted time at destinations where ownership may otherwise be inaccessible. If it sounds like a great deal, you’re not alone in thinking so. According to the American Resort Development Association, over 9.9 million American households owned at least one timeshare in 2020. Timeshare companies advertise timeshares as investments with long-term value for people and their families. After all, who wouldn’t want guaranteed vacations at some of the most beautiful places in the world? The reality is that many timeshare companies use dishonest practices to trap people into costly agreements. These practices include high-pressure sales presentations, blatant lies about usage rights, and high-interest loan payments. These agreements have devastating consequences for owners. For example, if someone is unable to pay the hefty fees, a timeshare company could foreclose on the property and cause serious damage to the owner’s credit. Should an owner wish to cancel their timeshare, they are at risk of being taken advantage of by the reseller industry. In most situations, reseller companies will help the owner cancel, but at the cost of thousands of dollars-- sometimes double the worth of the timeshare. In the worst cases, fraudulent reseller companies will prey on vulnerable owners. One such company may lie to earn the owner’s trust, collect a payment for “selling” the property to buyers, claim the buyers backed out of the deal, then disappear with the money. Recognizing the need for trustworthy service in the timeshare exit industry, Howard and his team started Cancel Timeshare to assist victims of these predatory practices. Howard’s clients are timeshare owners who want to exit their timeshare as quickly and as cost effectively as possible. They need guidance because timeshare contracts are complex and often sold fraudulently. To address this need, Cancel Timeshare works directly with timeshare companies to facilitate an owner’s release from their contract. They are the only timeshare exit company to display their pricing online, and use a subscription model to allow clients to pay for the service through monthly payments. To further support transparent communication, Cancel Timeshare clients are able to view the status of their case at any time through the Cancel Timeshare’s mobile app, which Howard built using Stacker. Stacker’s platform allows anyone to create beautiful and functional apps from spreadsheet data. Its freemium model allows small businesses like Cancel Timeshare to build the apps they need without hiring engineering talent. Within a year, Cancel Timeshare was growing fast. To stay on top of everything, Howard needed to:Although Stripe’s platform comes with some analytics features, they can be difficult to navigate for those who aren’t developers. As a result, Howard and his team were manually keeping track of revenue in several different apps and spreadsheets. After integrating their Stripe account with Baremetrics, the process was immediately automated and gave the team predictable insights for their recurring revenue.Failed charges are inevitable for subscription businesses. Whether the reason is an expired credit card, insufficient funds, or outdated billing info, subscription businesses lose around 9% of their monthly recurring revenue (MRR) due to failed payments. Recover by Baremetrics helps bring that money back with a variety of tools such as customizable email campaigns, in-app reminders and paywalls, and credit card capture forms. Cancel Timeshare started using Recover in March 2021. In just one month, the tool has saved the small business over $686.11 in revenue. “Within the first month of using Recover, it more than paid for itself,” says Howard. “It’s definitely impressive.” Howard also noted the importance of how they address payment issues with clients. Considering the financial hardship that many Cancel Timeshare users have faced, money issues can understandably be a sensitive subject. Therefore, personalized messaging goes a long way.As a small business, it’s especially important for Howard and his team to provide excellent customer service. Smart tools like Baremetrics’ People Insights make it easy. Cancel Timeshare uses People Insights to access detailed information about every client. This includes a timeline of their Cancel Timeshare subscription, which allows his team to  answer questions efficiently. The Customer tab also allows Howard and his team to manually adjust payments and subscription settings. For example, if a client is unable to pay over 12 months, then Howard and his team will access the client’s Customer profile and extend the subscription to 18 months or 24 months. In just one year, Cancel Timeshare has helped over 169 clients exit their timeshares and regain financial stability. The company’s next step is to help people repair their damaged credit, an unfortunate outcome of buying, financing, and getting rid of timeshares. To fulfill this mission, Cancel Timeshare recently acquired Credit Renew and are currently building upon its existing credit repair platform.“We're applying the lessons we learned about customer success and customer engagement with Cancel Timeshare to Credit Renew,” said Howard. “We believe that when you do the right thing, offer a great service, and make it affordable, your business will do well.”Be sure to check out Cancel Timeshare’s blog. There's tons of helpful advice for navigating the timeshare industry. \n",

      "Managing performance metrics is crucial for SaaS and subscription businesses. This article compares two of the best platforms: Stripe vs. Baremetrics! For millions of subscription companies, Stripe has become the go-to tool for managing payments and subscribers. The platform’s sheer popularity and recent $95 billion valuation speak for themselves, right?That said, there are some key features, calculations, and dashboards that Stripe is missing that Baremetrics does better for SaaS companies serious about metric management.In this guide, we’ll break down the (friendly!) battle of Stripe vs. Baremetrics, highlighting how both platforms can wrangle your essential company data.Let’s be clear: Stripe and Baremetrics are totally on the same team when it comes to empowering companies to make sense of their numbers.In fact, Baremetrics integrates with Stripe!To kick things off, let’s take a look at the strengths of each platforms’ dashboards and what sets them apart.At a glance, the Stripe dashboard answers loud and clear “How am I getting paid?”In-depth reporting breaks down balances, payouts, subscription volumes, and more. Users can clearly see where their money is coming from and how revenue compares from month-to-month. Stripe’s data visualization is clean, straightforward, and easy to read. Beyond the payment dashboard, the platform boasts a number of features specific to subscription-based businesses such as:Stripe’s pricing customization features are particularly powerful.We’ve talked in the past about the ups and downs of the various SaaS pricing models out there. With a tool like Stripe, you can instantly test and switch between pricing structures in a snap, meaning you can customize your service offering as-needed.To be clear, Stripe’s reporting features are nothing to scoff at. Even so, they aren’t the be-all, end-all of metric monitoring.The fact that Stripe started out as a payment processor is telling. Many of the platform’s features are geared toward ecommerce companies first and foremost.Stripe’s subscription-specific features are a solid starting point for SaaS companies, but certain aspects of their reporting leave a lot to be desired.And that’s where Baremetrics comes in to pick up the slack.Unlike Stripe, Baremetrics was designed specifically with SaaS and subscription businesses in mind. In short, we make it easy to monitor your subscribers’ every move and uncover trends as they happen. You can think of Baremetrics’ dashboard as Stripe on steroids as we put your most important metrics front-and-center to support your long-term growth.That means watching your MRR. Reducing churn. Tracking upgrades and downgrades.And that doesn’t even scratch the surface.Perhaps most importantly, the insights from Baremetrics encourage companies to be more proactive and build better customer relationships. Rather than second-guessing what your next move should be or which subscribers deserve your immediate attention, our platform spells out all of the above in black and white. As an added bonus, Baremetrics can automate many of these pressing tasks (such as dunning management or customer outreach) for you.Now, let’s take a deeper dive into the features that separate Stripe vs. Baremetrics. Remember that analytics tools aren’t necessarily a matter of either-or for SaaS companies. In fact, the average company juggles a software stack consisting of dozens of tools: both Stripe and Baremetrics should totally be on your radar.That said, we feel strongly about our ability to give users the most comprehensive understanding of their data that produces positive outcomes. Below we’ve broken down five ways Baremetrics can help you do exactly that.The importance of MRR can’t be overstated for SaaS businesses. Sustaining and growing your base of subscribers is your end-game and MRR is a key metric to assess your business’ health along the way.Monitoring MRR might seem like a no-brainer and is something that both Stripe and Baremetrics can do. However, accuracy counts when it comes to MRR and that’s where Baremetrics goes the extra mile. Stripe’s platform can potentially include trial users in your MRR calculations, which in turn could inflate or throw off your data. If your monthly revenue numbers aren’t 100% correct, you could put yourself in a situation where you make premature business decisions (think: new hires or campaigns you can’t afford). Avoiding these headaches means pulling accurate numbers. Baremetrics delivers in that department by providing users with detailed MRR reports broken down by day and sources such as new subscribers, expansions, and reactivations.Keeping subscribers around for the long haul means forming relationships with your customers rather than simply treating them like numbers.By identifying your “best” customers (think: most loyal, biggest spenders) you can understand which accounts deserve your undivided attention. For example, your most longest-term customers are prime candidates for VIP treatment in terms of bonuses, offers, and rewards.You can likewise find common threads between your best customers to help refine your audience targeting in the future.Rather than dig for this data “by hand,” Baremetrics can uncover it in just a few clicks. For example, you can assess your best customers based on their LTV, amount spent, or both. This process can also highlight which products, features, and plans correlate with more loyal subscribers.Churn is a massive thorn in the side of any SaaS business on the rise.You should not only keep an eye on turnover for the sake of your bottom line, but also assess why customers decide to leave in the first place. This can help you uncover potential leaks in your funnel and areas where your company isn’t delivering.Maybe your onboarding process is subpar. Perhaps you’re just too pricey. Either way, Baremetrics’ cancellation insights can clue you in on these issues and drive you to take action ASAP.While Stripe does a great job of highlighting where your company has been numbers-wise, Baremetrics excels at showing you where you’re headed as well.Specifically, our platform is capable of putting together accurate revenue forecasts based on your month-to-month performance data. Assessing past trends, you can look toward the future and temper your expectations accordingly. Having this data handy allows you to create better benchmarks and budget for new initiatives. For example, our cash flow calculator assesses your subscription data to forecast future revenue...If you aren’t actively working toward retaining and recovering customers on the verge of churning, you’re leaving money on the table.Of course, the process of identifying subscribers in danger of churning and reaching out to them manually is incredibly time-consuming. Thankfully, Baremetrics’ ability to immediately highlight failed charges and trigger messages to keep customers in your funnel without leaving our platform. Combined with our own slew of integrations, you can totally customize the winback process yourself.We get it: SaaS companies have plenty of metrics to track and so many tools to choose from.And there’s no denying that Stripe is an incredibly powerful tool. If your main concerns are streamlined billing and flexible pricing options, they can definitely deliver big in that department.But if you’re more interested in powerful analytics and automation to help win and retain more subscribers, Baremetrics has you covered. Our platform dives deep into the most important SaaS metrics and trends that ultimately support your company’s growth. If you’re still curious or torn between tools, make sure to read more about what separates us from Stripe.Or better yet, get started with a free trial of Baremetrics if you haven’t already to see all of the features above in action!\n"

      "QuickNode is a Miami-based startup powering blockchain applications with lightning fast Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, BSC and xDai nodes. QuickNode provides elastic APIs & dedicated node services, as well as powerful tools & analytics. A simple control panel brings it all together and makes infrastructure management easy.This allows anyone building an app that applies blockchain technology to do so by building directly on top of QuickNode’s globally distributed Web3 infrastructure.Trusted by top blockchain projects, QuickNode has launched over 3,000 nodes and has been helping advance the blockchain ecosystem since 2018. Baremetrics spoke with co-founder Dmitry Shklovsky to learn more about QuickNode and how they use Baremetrics to understand key financial metrics, translate cancellation data to inform product iteration, and sustain long-term growth. In 2017 and 2018, many new blockchain projects started offering their tokens for sale. While blockchain technology was spearheaded by Bitcoin starting from 2008, using the technology for other applications became popularized around 2017. With this popularization of blockchain came an influx of new users that caused infrastructure issues for websites interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. This unbalanced cycle of blockchain app developers not having the infrastructure they need is happening again today. The QuickNode team decided to apply their combined 40+ years of industry experience to address this problem. How could they build web infrastructure to onboard the next billion users to the fast approaching Web 3.0?For those who may not be familiar, Web 3.0 is the third and most advanced generation of the Internet. In the 1990s, Web 1.0 gave the world static web pages and the ability to search for and read information. Where Web 2.0 (what we use today) advanced mobile usage, cloud infrastructure, and interactivity through social media, Web 3.0 will build upon machine learning and artificial intelligence to process information with almost human-like ability. Web 3.0 is expected to be a more transparent, peer-to-peer based Internet, which is why it’s commonly associated with blockchain. It’s an exciting progression of emerging technologies with the potential for far-reaching social and economic benefit. One of these major social implications will be the shift of power and data ownership from large corporations back to individual users. “In Web 3.0, QuickNode wants to see technology transform decentralized applications, smart contracts, decentralized governance, voting systems, and more. There are so many things that can be evolved,” says Shklovsky. When talking about how blockchain will change the world, Shklovsky says “some people use the word disrupted, but I try to think of it more as an evolution of how we handle our data and how we transfer value.” Shklovsky and his teammates started building QuickNode in 2018 as a fun project during spare time, nights and weekends. When business picked up later that year, the team decided to go full-time and raise money. After some initial success and revenue growth, QuickNode received additional interest from investors for a new round. To continue fundraising, it was clear that QuickNode had to dial deeper into business metrics. The solution was clear for co-founder Auston Bunsen: implement Baremetrics right away to see what was actually happening financially with the business. Bunsen, a serial founder and multi-CTO before starting QuickNode, had used Baremetrics in previous roles and was familiar with the value it brought to growing businesses. Baremetrics has proven to be a valuable tool for QuickNode’s fundraising goals and daily operations. Using Baremetrics with Recover and Cancellation Insights, QuickNode is able to:For example, if a customer is canceling due to a cost issue, QuickNode can access detailed feedback collected through a customizable form, adjust pricing, and save the customer from churning.In addition to seamlessly collecting data, Cancellation Insights also calculates trends by cancellation reason to help guide your team’s focus. Best of all, it integrates easily and quickly. “We were considering building this stuff in-house, but quickly realized we could do it with Baremetrics,” says Shklovsky. Every single day, Shklovsky is looking closely at MRR, ARR, who’s canceled, who’s upgraded, and who’s downgraded. Baremetrics, he says, “is like a barometer of how happy customers are.”With its ability to cut through the noise and show only the most important data, Baremetrics reveals crucial customer insights. If a customer is happy, then they're operating and growing. If a customer is not happy, then they’re downgrading, downsizing and canceling. The biggest challenge QuickNode faces is growing within the relatively new blockchain industry. Unlike pre-existing industries in which companies can enter and capture market share more easily, surviving in blockchain means Shklovsky and his team must take a more visionary approach to sustainable long-term growth. “The Blockchain services market is around $5 Billion today,” says Shklovsky. “In five years, it's going to be a part of over $55 Billion. So we just have to maintain that course, outlast the competition, and keep iterating.” QuickNode is one of 900+ subscription-based companies using Baremetrics to understand key metrics and accelerate growth.

      "What is churn management? Are there any two words that SaaS companies hate more than customer churn?The good news is there are several tips and tools, like Baremetrics, to improve customer experience and customer satisfaction, measure and analyze churn, and develop strategies to put an end to churners.Click here to start a free trial with Baremetrics today to see all of the ways we can help you.If you're dealing with a high churn rate, you're in the right place. In this post, we will go over some of the top strategies for effective churn management that lead to high customer retention rates and profitability. You can't stop existing customers from leaving or subscribers from unsubscribing if you don't know why they're deciding to pull the plug.Therefore, we recommend adding a short survey to your cancellation flow to ask customers to give you a concrete reason for their departure. This will provide you with some excellent insight into the causes of customer churn.When you start getting responses, you can start to look at the data and make the necessary changes to stop it. Make sure you customize the cancellation reasons in your survey based on your product.At Baremetrics, our Cancellation Insights create questionnaires for customers to answer before they close their accounts. If you want to start a free trial using cancellation insights, click here today.The following are some examples that customers choose prior to leaving:Transparency has become increasingly important in recent years, as people get used to being able to \"Google\" anything by having instant access to friends, family, brands, and even the world's biggest stars, all thanks to social media.Customers are likely to stick with a business during a brand crisis if it has a history of being transparent.You can increase your transparency by openly sharing your business metrics, from revenue to churn and many others. This is an added level of transparency that helps your valuable customers build trust in you.Failed payments such as, when customers' credit card payments don't go through, can undoubtedly cause companies to lose out on a lot of revenue.We recently analyzed some data and found that, on average, SaaS and subscription companies lose around 9 percent of their MRR because of failed payments.Current customers aren't waiting around checking their payments in anticipation that it will fail so that they can make their payments. When they realize their payment has failed, they may abandon the sale forever.That is why a system to handle failed payments immediately is critical to fighting customer churn. We recommend using a dunning tool rather than manually attempting to capture failed payments from customers' credit cards.A dunning tool can automate the entire process for you. Several types of dunning tools are out there, many of which are built right into your subscription billing software. One of the hardest challenges of reducing a company's churn rate is figuring out where to start when it comes to churn management strategies.Is it spread across customers from each plan you offer?Is it the customers who signed up with a coupon who are churning the quickest?To find out, you must use customer data to analyze your churn by customer segments or cohorts.These customer segments are different ways for you to group customers, i.e., by their location, plan level, and so forth. Since the majority of SaaS companies use multiple pricing plans, that's an excellent place to start.You will never develop a strong customer relationship if you leave them to their own devices.The customer relationship building should start with a magnetic onboarding program where you walk them through the steps of getting started.Ensure that you answer any questions that may pop up from your customers and reinforce the product's value to them or their company.A strong onboarding program will ensure customers don't simply sign up, try the product once, and abandon it forever. They will ensure that they provide answers on how the product can benefit them.All of the above ways to curb customer churn are examples of what Baremetrics can do for SaaS companies that will lead to higher customer success, customer retention, and less customer churn.Baremetrics will provide you with all of the information you need straight from our dashboards; then, it exports data into a spreadsheet to allow you to analyze and modify it further.Baremetrics has tools that will help you keep new customers satisfied and impressed with your product and service and turn them into loyal customers.For more information on how Baremetrics can help you kick customer churn to the curb, click here for a free trial.\n",
      "What Are Customer Retention Tools.\n",
      "What’s more important: a loyal customer or a new customer? That’s the age-old question in business.Customer retention tools can help you answer this question by helping you push to keep your existing customers, as well as monitoring the revenue coming in from each customer cohort.Did you know, it can cost five times more to attract new customers than it is to retain loyal customers?What’s more, repeat customers spend more than new customers do. The value of loyal customers simply cannot be ignored. But, how do you retain customers and put an end to customer churn for good?The good news is, there are plenty of tools to help you with that, including Baremetrics. In this post, we will go over some effective tips to boost the customers’ experience with your product and thus, increase customer retention.If you’re interested in customer retention tools, click here to get into the Baremetrics free trial where you can test it out!To stop churn and keep existing customers coming back, you’ll need to do some analysis of your current situation. Finding out when exactly customers churn is a powerful tool to stop them from churning.Baremetrics cohorts is an excellent tool to help you determine when customers churn — by allowing you to segment your customer base and provide you with more insights about when people are churning.This allows you to take a proactive approach to stop churn as well as being able to monitor if those efforts are working. Contact Baremetrics to begin a trial using Cohorts today.Who doesn’t love free stuff, rewards, and discounts? This is why customer loyalty programs are one of the most effective customer retention strategies.A customer loyalty program rewards customers for their continual business. The more they shop, the more they are rewarded. This keeps them happy because they now get more from the experience than just your product or service.Loyalty programs help customers feel special and appreciated, two characteristics required for happy, loyal customers.Social media is critical to creating loyal customers. There’s a reason social media is a huge part of every company’s marketing strategy. With social media, you can build trust, a lasting relationship, and loyalty with your subscribers.To use social media to build relationships and increase customer satisfaction, you must create valuable content that’s not overly promotional.Remember, customers like to connect with brands they like, so, your tone must be relatable and friendly. To increase customer engagement, you must also provide content they can engage with.Photos and videos do much better with engagement than plain text posts. Use polls and Q&A forms to encourage your customers to engage with you. And, reply to everything (or as much as you possibly can).Social media is also a powerful listening tool that can help boost your retention rate. It also provides a direct communication line with customers, something past businesses could only dream of.So, use that to your advantage to understand what your customers are looking for and start aligning your social media posts and products with their preferences.Ask for customer feedback regularly and respond to all of it — even the negative feedback.Data shows that 40-60% of users will sign up for a free SaaS app trial, use it once, and abandon it forever.This is because, without a successful onboarding program, customers are unable to perceive how your service or product can add value for them.Make sure you develop an outstanding onboarding program to communicate clearly with your customers in real-time as they go through each stage of the sales funnel.This will ensure that they don’t lose sight of your company’s value if they don’t understand something or have an unanswered question.A company newsletter provides an easy and cost-effective way to improve your customer retention rate via email marketing. You can use email automation to send all of your customers’ updates and offers at the same time.You can also send the email via an RSS feed on a frequency that you pre-determine. This will ensure that you don’t have to worry about manually updating content and remembering to click “send.”One surefire way to improve your customer experience and impress your current customers is by providing stellar customer support.If your customers know that even if something goes wrong with their order or product, they can reach someone from your company who will resolve the issue ASAP with a smile on their face.They are then going to be much more likely to take the jump and purchase a product or service from you.A help desk that is manned 24/7 or a mobile app with 24/7 messaging gives customers peace of mind to know that no matter what, when something goes awry, help is always available.To reduce churn, you must make your product indispensable and provide frequent value that customers can’t live without.One way to do that is with a daily/weekly email report that shows the value you’re providing to the customer.At Baremetrics, we do this with a daily/weekly/monthly email report that shows key metrics.

      "Many SaaS businesses concentrate on offering an amazing product and then neglect customer support. They assume that when you have a great product, customers will always come back.This isn’t always true.In this guide, you will learn why SaaS customer support is so important, how to get started, and what metrics to use to track success.SaaS customer support involves the services you offer to help your customers have a great experience while using your product. These services include answering customer inquiries, assistance during onboarding, and troubleshooting any problems the customer might encounter while using your product.A common problem customers face when dealing with a SaaS business is credit cards failing during recurring payments. If the support team fails to deal with this issue effectively, the business might end up losing the customer and revenue.Another issue customers might encounter while using your product are bugs. While anyone would prefer to release a product with no bugs, this rarely happens. You need an effective support team to assist customers when they encounter bugs.The support reps also must inform the product team of bugs that customers encounter regularly so they can be fixed.Customer support is the foundation of a successful SaaS business model. Your support agents should strive to offer prospects and clients an excellent customer experience.Now that you understand what customer support is, let’s learn how it can help your business.Churn is the number of customers that leave a business after making a purchase. For a SaaS business, it occurs when a customer cancels, pauses, or downgrades their subscription.The reality is that unhappy customers are going to churn. Some reasons why a customer might be unhappy include:Customer support plays a significant role in reducing customer churn. A customer is 4 times more likely to switch to a competitor if the problem they’re having is customer support rather than product or price related.No matter how hard you try, your product is bound to have issues. Providing amazing customer support will ensure that you assist the customer when they encounter these issues.Monthly recurring revenue is the clearest indicator of the growth of a SaaS business. It offers insight into how well your software is performing financially. The sustainability of the business depends on how much revenue is received at the end of the month.Customer support is important because it directly affects MRR.  A report from Bain and Company shows that businesses can increase revenue by up to 8 percent by prioritizing offering a better customer experience.Simply put, the most effective way to increase MRR is by retaining the customers you have. You retain the customers you have by providing exceptional customer support.Customer lifetime value (CLTV) represents the total amount of money a customer will potentially spend on your business throughout their lifetime. It directly affects your business revenue. The higher your CLTV percentage, the more revenue you make.So how does customer support affect CLTV?Quality customer support is needed to retain customers. If your business offers poor customer services, your customers will port to your competitors even if your product is good. Reports show that one-third of customers will switch after one poor customer support experience.Another 68% of your customers will leave your company if they believe you don’t care about them.Customers want to know that if they encounter a problem while using your product, you will be there to resolve it. Resolving these problems quickly shows that they can depend on you.If you offer a  great product and customers are happy with the way you treat them, they are more likely to become long-term clients hence increasing their lifetime value.Your goal is to make the customer support experience as seamless as possible. Here are 4 key ways to do this:Your contact information must be clearly stated on your website. Place it in prominent areas on your website like your sidebar, headers, footer section, and after blog posts.You should also have a dedicated “Contact Us” page that shows your phone number, email address, and social media handle.Not all customers will want to use email or live chat support. Some might prefer to speak to a customer rep directly. The customer rep must be professional and knowledgeable. According to Marketing Land, 74 percent of customers are likely to go with a competitor due to poor customer support over the phone.Using a CRM system will help centralize and organize your customer communication process. It allows you to track interactions with customers and share data in real-time with team members.CRMs also automate data-entry to provide a clear and complete picture of customer interactions. You will be able to save all email exchanges, live chat messages, or customer support requests that involve each customer.Tip: Your customers expect you to be active on social media. Using social media allows you to efficiently reach a much wider group of customers than using traditional methods like email and phone. Thanks to social media, customers often feel “closer” to the brands they work with.Live chat makes it easy for customers to contact support agents with just the click of a button.It is one of the most effective customer support systems because customers receive a response to their queries in real-time, unlike email that might take hours or days. Live chat is also great for addressing any pre-sale concerns the customer might have.Some recommended live chat companies include Help Scout, MobileMonkey, and Olark.When encountering software problems, many customers head directly to the FAQs page. Reports from SuperOffice show that 40% of consumers prefer self-service over human contact.You need to create in-depth knowledge bases or FAQ pages that address common queries your customer will have.Being proactive can save your support agents a lot of stress. It also improves the customer experience significantly.Some of the common customer support issues that SaaS customers face are:Software is bound to break down at one point or the other. For example, a software update can create bugs or missing features. You must test for bugs regularly so that you can discover them before the customer does.Failed payments are another issue that SaaS businesses face. This can be very frustrating to customers and cause them to abandon their subscriptions.Concerned about losing revenue due to failed payments? Recover by Baremetrics helps SaaS businesses significantly reduce failed payments and combat churn, ultimately putting some money back in your pocket.Your support team serves as the first touch-point with the customer after a sale. Lacking an efficient support staff can be detrimental to your SaaS company.Invest in training programs for your customer supporting staff. They should have in-depth knowledge of your software and the services you offer.Along with having technical skills, they should also have great soft skills like empathy and communication.How should you determine the success of your customer systems?These metrics will help you get started:A customer satisfaction score is an indication of how satisfied your customers are with your support.You can identify this by running a satisfaction survey. Customers will rate their experience using a predefined scale. For example 1-3 means they are not happy with your support, 4-6 means your support is manageable, 7-10 means your support is excellent.To ensure that customers participate in the survey, make it short.Customer retention rate is the percentage of customers that are retained in a company after a given period. They are several factors that affect customer retention with customer support being one of them. Offering exceptional customer services directly affects your retention rate. Learn how to calculate customer retention rates.Customer churn is the opposite of customer retention. It can also be called customer attrition. It is the number of customers you lost in a given period.Poor customer support can cause customers to move to your competitors (as explained earlier in this guide). An experienced and effective support team can help reduce churn. Learn more about customer churn and how to calculate it here.Tracking the total number of customer support tickets will help you quickly identify when things go wrong.An increase in support tickets might be due to a bug after a software update or website issues. You must keep track of how this number changes so you can mitigate issues before they get too serious.This is an important question SaaS businesses must address.Building an efficient and reliable customer support system will help you increase retention and reduce churn rate.Baremetrics delivers the valuable insights you need to understand your business and customers.

      "How Nudge Coach Reduced Customer Churn By Over 70%.\n",
      "Anyone managing a SaaS or subscription business is aware of customer churn. You may not be an expert, but you are at least familiar with the idea that your customers are only with you for a finite period of time.That means achieving any essence of “growth” requires replacing lost customers faster than the rate at which they churn.Managing churn is much like a constant game of plugging holes in a bucket so that you can eventually have a “rising tide” of water. When your water is rising, you’ve reached the point that I consider growth efficiency, where regardless of speed you at least know that the water will continue to rise.This is when the good stuff starts to happen within a subscription business 🙂In this post I’m going to share the strategy and steps we followed to reduce our monthly customer churn by over 70%, and explain how we positioned Nudge Coach for efficient, long-term growth.In January of 2020, we realized that one of the major problems holding back our company was a customer churn rate of 19%. The graph below, taken from our Baremetrics account, shows our customer churn throughout January 2020.In the sea of data and decision making that we all wade through everyday, this stood out to us as an indicator that something needed to be fixed. The benchmark customer churn for SaaS for SMBs is 5%. At 19.20%, we were dramatically off-base.We knew if we wanted to keep our business growing, we needed to figure out why so many customers were leaving, and provide the value-add they need to stay. At that moment, we made it our goal for 2020 to reduce customer churn to 5%. Fast forward a year, and by the end of 2020, we had reached an average monthly customer churn of 6%, with some days dipping below 5%. Check out our user churn graph from our Baremetrics account, ending in January 2021:It wasn’t easy. It took us 10 months, including additional efforts being made all the way up to 2021. Let me tell you how we did it!Before we get into our strategy, let me give you a little more background on our situation and how we got there.On January 1st 2020, we transitioned the company out of a strategic partnership (we were operating the platform under a non SaaS business model!). We were looking to relaunch the user-driven, SaaS side of our businesses. A year earlier we’d launched the MVP of the model allowing SMB customers to input a credit card to get access to the platform, but we hadn’t had a chance to dedicate time or resources to optimizing a proper SaaS onboarding funnel.As a budding SaaS offering, we had some things in place, but a lot of the older design remained. Our smallest self-serve plan was basically a revolving door, and users couldn’t upgrade or downgrade their plan without calling a sales person.Up until January 2020, almost all of our growth over the past 5 years had been generated through a pretty traditional sales-led growth strategy. Site traffic became leads, we nurtured leads to the point of booking calls with our sales team, and then we let the sales team take prospects through the point of conversion. Due to this style, the customers that we converted were very loyal. This means that our revenue churn was very low. But what about all of those new leads coming into the funnel, that we didn’t have time to talk to, who kept churning at a rate of 19%? We saw this as a big missed opportunity.Even with the high churn rate we saw some other really promising signs:To describe further our product’s situation, here’s what we already had in place:I’m generally known as “the metrics” guy, so needless to say there was plenty of analysis on the front end surrounding customer churn to see how heavy this lift was going to be for us.Spoiler alert… there was plenty of work to do, but the encouraging signs within the data gave us confidence that we would be able to reduce churn, and that it would positively impact business. Our self-serve funnel was regularly acquiring new customers but most didn’t stick around very long or expand beyond the initial tier. But we have the leads, the market is big, and we have lots of loyal customers. All of this led to one profound realization...To maximize the opportunity we’re seeing in the high rate of sign ups, we needed to completely reimagine how we acquired and onboarded customers.We needed to ensure customers not only immediately understood how to use the system, but  saw enough value to stick around and consider upgrading. If we could get a customer activated and expanded to a larger tier, then we had a far better chance of keeping them around at a much higher dollar amount.For those more familiar with SaaS, most of our problems stemmed around user activation. The system was too flexible and didn’t provide enough guidance and structure for those going through enrollment. We didn’t provide any type of handholding from our team, resulting in a lack of engagement from our users.Looking at the challenge ahead, we were confident we could accomplish what was required, but recognized that it would probably take us 9-12 months to complete the remodeling of our customer acquisition and onboarding method. This would also mean shifting our growth strategy from a sales-led to a product-led approach.We recalibrated and realigned the team’s focus on restructuring the platform in a way that would make it easier for a user to adopt without hands-on training, and identified the value gaps that we weren’t providing to the customer. This would enable us to increase the overall value of the system to customers.Moving forward, the platform would become the foundation and building block for our revamped customer acquisition and retention strategy, and help us achieve our team goal of keeping our monthly account churn below 5%.It took us over 9 months, but here’s how we did it. Before we get into the strategy it’s important to understand the factors that cause churn.Being that we largely cater to SMB clients we are naturally going to have a higher churn rate than those targeting enterprise customers. This is because of the nature of SMBs occasionally pivoting or going out of business. It’s sad to see, but that’s unfortunately one of the big reasons we see accounts leave.Aside from shutting down, churn largely results from one of the following factors:Over time, our goal at Nudge Coach is to implement strategies and solutions that address all of these factors. If you have a small team, start with ensuring system reliability and providing great user support. You’d be amazed what you can achieve with a great customer experience, even if your product is feature-light at that time. Failure in these two areas is the fastest way to lose customers, so treat these as the foundation and start building from there.Our high-level strategy to reduce customer churn was built around 3 core principles:I view this as a long term goal that you can strive for but never technically reach. We felt we had a value gap so we started putting together a list of shortcomings we felt were holding back our product from being great and we started addressing those one at a time. It’s not about releasing a flurry of features as much as constantly trying to improve on the experience… there’s a difference.In the SMB SaaS world, if you don’t have any type of trial experience you are going to see a significant number of 1-month accounts who sign up simply to see if the product fits their needs. We wanted to restructure our model to allow users to start paying when they were ready, which we anticipated would immediately reduce churn by > 25%.I believe strongly in the build-measure-learn feedback loop and it’s something that we have relied heavily on over the past few years to optimize our marketing funnel to deliver consistent results.The main thing to remember - you can’t optimize what you don’t measure. Tackling churn requires constant measuring and iteration. Try and address one item from your to-do list at a time, measure its impact, refine if necessary, then move on to the next best item.Baremetrics allowed us to not only have constant oversight of our churn rate, but even more importantly it enabled us to compare data across plan types and monitor how changes impacted new cohorts of customers each month.One of the main things to keep in mind is that the time and resources required to operationalize some of these strategies will greatly differ.Some prevention measures may only take a few days while others may require months of team resources to properly address - it’s for this reason that I strongly suggest identifying where your weak points are and prioritizing which solutions to pursue.Most people don’t realize this but there are countless, well-documented methods to prevent customer churn - below are the stages and activities we followed. After a brief outline of the to-do list, we’ll go into an in depth description of each phase. When resources are limited it’s important to prioritize. Out of everything in Phase 1, we knew the transition to a freemium model would take the most time, so in the meantime we looked for some quick wins. In general, Phase 1 items are items that can be implemented within a few weeks and will have an immediate impact on your churn numbers. If you don’t already have a solid customer support structure in place, I recommend you prioritize that in your phase 1. At Nudge Coach, our customer support was in good shape, so I left that out here.   While your customers may have every intention of paying you regularly, their credit card may have something different in mind.Failed payments, or soft churn, is the killer of most subscription businesses - in fact, around 9% of your MRR is at-risk of loss to failed payments.“Dunning” is the communication process used to systematically communicate to customers based on failed (or soon-to-be failing payments) so that they upgrade their payment details.Luckily there are systems, like Baremetrics, that sit on top of your payment processor (i.e. Stripe) and trigger custom email sequences based on failed payments and expiring credit cards. This is very much a “squeaky wheel” situation.The key is to stay in front of people to maximize your chance of getting updated details. Keep the copy succinct and to the point.At the time, about 10% of our churn was soft churn, and we had been tackling it using Recover for multiple years. When talking to a Baremetrics rep last year, we realised we had been overly conservative with the number of dunning emails we were sending out. We increased the count of emails so that each at-risk customer received 6 emails over a 30-day period. This made sure their card details were collected, and we immediately saw a slight reduction in soft churn. We’ll talk more on soft churn as we get into upfront payments for annual plans later!Early on it’s really important to understand why customers decide to leave - is your offering too expensive? Solution not working properly? Better products out there? It’s impossible to improve your numbers if you don’t have an idea of the problem you need to address.For this reason I’d highly recommend getting away from a simple one-click to cancel button and adopt a system that allows you to easily implement an off boarding form that you can embed within a cancelation flow.Why? People follow the path of least resistance, and early on the clarity you get for why people leave is just as valuable as the dollars they were paying you.Not only will this help you prioritize your team’s focus, but the responses will also enable your team to leverage targeted email campaigns to retain a portion of customers on their way out.We don’t expect to save many of the accounts that cancel but the feedback we receive is invaluable and has been critical for us to further improve the platform and our numbers each month.I can’t stress enough the importance of intent. In our previous structure, we had a number of coaches come into the funnel that were simply looking to explore different systems.As I highlighted above, we knew we needed to restructure our process for customer acquisition, as most of our leads had little intent on actually becoming a long term customer.While most everyone else in our industry had a pretty generic 14-day free trial, we see a lot of coaches struggling to get their business off the ground. Therefore we thought there was significant opportunity with a freemium model. Another major supporting logic for transitioning to Freemium is that our users will start to experience a “Switching cost”. Although it might not cost a lot of money for our coaches to switch to a competitor in the future, we believe that if we can get them using our product for a while, there will be a significant time-cost for them to switch to a different provider. One common issue business owners experience when implementing a freemium model is the cost of actually hosting all of those free users. It eats up server space and can cause your expenses to sky rocket over earnings. We needed to make sure our freemium model didn’t expose us to any extraordinary costs that would make things go sideways. To limit costs, we decided to build a freemium model based around the number of connected clients a coach had, giving them 3 clients completely free when they signed up for their account. Freemium requires a lot of refinement so I’d recommend adopting an assisted approach for anyone considering freemium. This approach helps humanize the experience for new users, ensures the product is configured to maximize value for prospects, and identifies areas of confusion / friction within the onboarding experience. The MVP of our freemium offering that we launched in Phase 1 was admittedly raw. It checked the boxes for allowing a person to independently create a free account and upgrade to a paid account - but pretty much every other action, such as switching tiers, required emailing our team. While this MVP made fantastic strides towards reducing churn, we still needed to improve our customer acquisition and onboarding funnel. Phase 2 is all about measuring and optimizing our customer onboarding experience.For the sake of time, we didn’t include this capability within the MVP as we were more focused on user activation and conversion. Once we felt comfortable with funnel performance we shifted to this as quickly as we could. This strategy is one of the best things you can do for your business. Shifting to annual payments will…For us, most of our churn was with our introductory plan which was $25/month ($300/year). We found that these users were either using the plan as a stepping stone to a larger tier or the account would churn within the initial 4 months.Our next tier provides more value but with a marginal cost increase to the company, so we put together a special offer where a coach could purchase the higher value plan for $300 upfront. In this case the intro tier serves as a price anchor and makes the $300 upfront plan seem like a no-brainer to anyone planning on growing their business over the next year.This offer is actually baked within our system at this point because it’s been so effective for us. A great tip for other businesses out there: We technically introduced this concept several months earlier through our sales and customer support teams as something they could start using in conversations with both customers and prospects. This is a great way to get this done with zero development.One important consideration: it can be difficult to pitch someone on paying upfront for the year if they perceive your solution to be “too new” or if they’re uncertain about whether the company will still be around in 3 months. Leverage your reliability and community reviews when doing this!At this point our average customer churn for our paid plans, not including free trial users, on any given day was right around 6.5%. We’d felt like we’d thrown everything but the kitchen sink at the problem, but we still hadn’t reached our goal of 5%. We knew over the coming months we would be filling some additional value gaps in the platform that our research indicated would improve the numbers further. But we knew we still needed to implement additional strategies to improve the churn rate of our smaller paid accounts.We’ve always been a brand built around education. Since our inception we’ve regularly produced content surrounding online and remote coaching through blogs, podcasts, and webinars and it’s been a significant differentiator for our company.In addition, this year we started seeing a notable increase in demand for group coaching. We realized we can blend this together to further address our churn problem.The end result was our course, the Program Builder Mastermind, which was a 2-week cohort-based, group program where we taught our coaches to digitize their programming and launch an online offering. Content was provided by a mix of our team and outside partners, and was delivered through a combination of in-person sessions, recorded videos, and on Slack. Our initial thought was to only offer this to current customers with the idea that this would be a scalable way for us to work closely with our smaller account types, to ensure their success on the system. But after consideration we decided to open it up to all our free accounts as well. We opened up the program to everyone because we were intrigued to see if it would help drive further free-to-paid conversion. We launched the program by advertising a webinar to our “all-community-members email list”. The email list has about 15,000 people on it, made up of mostly leads and free accounts. In the webinar we promoted the Program Builder Mastermind, and we quickly booked about 40 participants for the first cohort of the course. The enrolment consisted of a pretty even split between users with free and paid accounts. We saw some very clear results of the Program Builder Mastermind!The results of Phase 3 were:This resulted in an additional 15% reduction in churn.Much like product market fit, churn is a constant you will deal with throughout the full lifecycle of your business. The key is identifying its drivers as quickly as possible so you can map our solutions to address each factor. Keep in mind that the returns will diminish over time as your product becomes more mature. Looking through the data our progression was broken into 3 specific stages that saw the following improvements:Phase 1 (initial 3 months)RESULT → 44% reduction in monthly account churnPhase 2 (months 3-9)RESULT → Additional 42% reduction in churnPhase 3 (within 9 months)RESULT → Combination of hard and soft returns, but based on early findings we estimate that this will end up further reducing our churn by an additional 10-20%.\n"

      "Price Optimization in SaaS: Customer Retention.\n",
      "This article will discuss the relationship between price change and customer retention.If I raise the price, will customers leave?The biggest challenge that leaders face is understanding how to think about price optimization and customer retention with the right framework.For example, many leaders focus on the churn metric as a proxy for customer retention. The problem with this is that churn doesn’t tell us anything about how long our customers subscribe for. After all, as some in the industry have pointed out, churn relates more to the age of our subscriptions than to the persistence of our subscribers.In this article (this is part one of our Price Optimization series), we will discuss the relationship between price change and customer retention, as well as the best metrics and methods for measurement.Let’s consider the price example from our series introduction. Suppose we quadrupled our price, gained some new customers, and our MRR was looking good. Do we know the customers will stay just as long as they used to?What if the higher price makes our service more noticeable in their budget, causing them to drop out sooner? Will they decide after a few months that our service is not worth it? What if we raise our prices and they don’t care?Typically we are told to use metrics like churn as a proxy for customer retention. These metrics will mislead us. First, let’s tackle why churn isn’t a useful metric.Take a look at this distribution plot of known subscription lengths from an actual SaaS sample below. Next to the subscription lengths graph, we have the implied survival curve as a function of time (it shows the probability of a subscription surviving up to that time).Notice the long tail in the distribution plot on the left. The plot has a mix of mostly short subscription lengths and a few long ones.Now, suppose we consider the population from the graph on the left as a distinct cohort of subscribers, and they all start simultaneously. Imagine measuring their churn over time. After the bulk of customers churn out initially, the remaining customers in the long tail are the only ones remaining. This means the churn rate would decrease over time.We can also see this in the decreasing trend in survival rates on the right. The probability curve for survival stops decreasing as fast when subscriptions get longer. Indicating the remaining customers are less likely to cancel.This shows us that, in reality, the churn rate is not constant. As this cohort progressed over time, we saw less and less churn. The longer a subscriber subscribes for, the less likely they are to churn. The churn metric is blind to this. People assume it measures retention when in reality, all it tells us is how young or old the subscriptions are.The churn metric won’t help us with price optimization. Let’s abandon the churn metric and look for something else!If we want to compare subscription lengths, then we should collect all the subscription lengths we have for each price, and compare their respective averages. Then we can tell if there is a difference, right?Nope. That would be a huge mistake. When we do this, we bias our estimate against longer subscriptions. The long-lasting subscribers are more likely to be still subscribing.These kinds of observations, where subscribers aren’t finished yet, are called censored data. We know when they began, and we know their subscriptions survived until the present. But we don’t know when they will cancel. That part is censored.The naive average subscription length ignores these censored customers, but they are the most valuable subscribers, and their contribution is critical for us to understand our customer retention.So both churn and naive averages are the wrong metrics to use. What options do we have for measuring customer retention?Since we don’t know how long the censored subscriptions will last, we need to make an educated guess. That’s where statistics comes in. We draw from a field of statistics that deals with time-to-event data, commonly known as Survival Analysis.Instead of using naive averages in our subscription lengths dataset, we will use the data we have to build a survival model.It is a model that attempts to describe all the possible subscription lengths and assigns a probability to each. It treats our data as a small subset of a much larger distribution of subscription lengths.If we use the model, we can extrapolate beyond our dataset, to define the overall pattern of subscription lengths, and get accurate estimates of its features, to answer questions like “what is the average subscription length.” The correct subscription length average to use is the average subscription length seen in that model. How does this work?First, we need to choose the distribution we will build our model with. Time-to-event data tend to follow a series of probability distributions called the exponential family. These probability distributions neatly model time-to-event processes in nature. The great thing about these is that they assign a likelihood that the subscription could reach any given length for both censored and uncensored data.We seamlessly plug in censored and uncensored data to get likelihood estimates for each subscription length. Then we use those likelihood estimates to choose the parameters for our model, in a process called Maximum Likelihood Estimation.We choose the parameters that maximize the likelihood of seeing the observations from our original real dataset. This ensures that our model closely fits our data.For now, we are going to use a flexible member of the exponential family: the Weibull distribution. Other distributions may be a closer fit to our data, but we will go with this one for the sake of simplicity.The Weibull distribution is flexible because it can handle increasing and decreasing cancelation rates as a function of time. You don’t need to understand this equation or remember it, but for those who are curious about how this works, here is the Weibull probability density function:The shape parameter denoted alpha () defines increasing or decreasing rates of survival. The scale parameter denoted sigma (σ) determines the spread, which dials the mean subscription length.From this, we can derive a function for the probability of surviving at least a given duration, called the Survival function S(t).The survival function gives the likelihood of survival of censored data because, in censored data, all we know is that the subscription lasted up to a certain point of time, and that it will end at some time beyond that.Note that the survival function also depends on both the shape and scale parameters. This allows us to use censored observations along with the uncensored ones to find optimal values for shape () and scale (α) to get the weibull distribution that is the closest fit to your data.After we fit a model like this to the data, we can take the mean of the distribution as our estimate for average customer retention.Below is an example of a Weibull distribution. This is just an example distribution to illustrate what it could look like. Moving forward we can play with the subscription price, sign up rates and customer retention to model our data:Now let’s compare using the Weibull distribution to estimate subscription lengths with the naive average, and see the difference.To show how much better it is to model your subscriptions with Weibull, let’s illustrate with a simulated example.Let’s imagine 60 subscriptions following the Weibull distribution, and censor about half of them. To make things harder and closer to reality, let’s censor them early, mostly below the actual mean subscription length. We’ll compare the naive average to the estimate from a survival model assuming the Weibull distribution.For speed, we’ll use a frequentist method for estimating the parameters with the Survival library in R.Let’s repeat this 100,000 times and compare the results on a density plot:See? The naïve estimate is terrible. It underestimates the actual average subscription length all the time.The Weibull estimate, on the other hand, tends to hit the target. Consider the challenges here: most of the data is of short duration and highly censored.Nevertheless, the model does a great job and wins. So how can we use this in a price optimization scheme?The next section will show two applications of the Weibull distribution.Let’s begin with a fundamental question. If we make a price change, are the subscription durations different?What if we raise our price, collect data, and want to compare subscription durations between two price points?Here are two examples to test using the Weibull distribution to model subscription lengths on simulated data.Since it’s a simulated example, we already know the truth, and we can test if our method can detect it.Let’s simulate a dataset that follows this story: say we offer a service at a low price, $20/month, and get 60 customers. We provide the same plan but raise it 80% to $36/month and get another 60 customers.In reality, we know that many factors can affect revenue, like sign-up rates, time, marketing, and so on. But for this example, we are going to assume that these don’t affect revenue, so we can focus on understanding the relationship between price, customer retention, and revenue.In this story, let’s assume that customers don’t like the higher price and cancel their subscriptions sooner, enough to neutralize any revenue gains.To summarize:Because we’re “playing God” in this data set, all the data points in our simulated data set follow the above conditions.So, what we will do is feed the Weibull model these simulated data points. Half of the data we feed to the Weibull model is censored. Then we will use the Weibull model to predict the customer retention based on a given subscription price.In other words, we will let the Weibull model learn from our simulated and censored data set. Then we can plug in a subscription price, and the Weibull model will predict the subscription length for us.Look at that! In the top plot, we see density plots for the average subscription length for each price point estimated by the model. These are the relative probabilities assigned by the model for the estimates. The higher the peak, the more likely the model thinks the estimate is.Notice that there is minimal overlap between the subscription lengths. We can interpret the lack of overlap as the model assigning very little probability that the average subscription lengths are the same between price points.In other words, the model is very confident that the subscription lengths are different between plans, and that customers drop out sooner in the more expensive plan. But what does that mean for our revenue?We get the implied revenue by multiplying the predicted durations by the respective monthly prices of each plan. This gives us an estimate of the expected lifetime value for a customer.It shows a lot of overlap between predictions. More overlapped than not. This means that the model isn’t sure if either plan is better concerning long-term revenue.While the less expensive price point retains more customers, it doesn’t yield more revenue. The Weibull model accurately detects this conclusion, while other methods may not be able to.Let’s pretend there is no difference in customer retention between price plans. Can our model detect this? What are the implications for revenue? Let’s set up another fake dataset, where we know that price does not affect subscription lengths.Half of the points in the dataset will be censored. After feeding our dataset to the Weibull model, will it be able to correctly predict the subscription lengths when given a price?Here is a summary of this scenario:In this scenario, the model shows a lot of overlap in the expected durations between plans. This means that the model assigns a lot of probability on the subscription lengths being the same.As a side note: the densities don’t overlap entirely because we used random samples to make our estimates, and that made them slightly different by chance.Despite this, the estimates weren’t different enough to tell if they came from different distributions, which is correct, because we know they came from the same distribution because we simulated it that way.When we multiply the durations by their prices, however, we see a big difference. The model is confident that the higher-priced plan is better. The higher-priced plan yields greater revenue in this scenario, because customers don’t drop out sooner.This is a situation where correctly estimating customer retention is critical, because the model (correctly) predicts that the more expensive plan yields $2000 lifetime value on average, compared to the less expensive plan that averages $750 lifetime value.This is all dependent on confirming that customers don’t drop out sooner, which our model also predicts correctly.It is easy to assume a causal relationship between price and duration in our simulations because we coded it that way. However, it would be a mistake to assume a causal relationship between prices and durations in the real world.This is because many factors other than price could cause the correlation. For example, a superior competitor could enter the market shortly after a price change. Or world events like a pandemic could force your customers out of business, shortening subscriptions. Small sample size and randomness could also make an apparent correlation.Unless we carefully construct an experiment, we can’t control for factors that confound our results. We need to be vigilant about finding any factor that could throw our predictions off.Even if we feel very confident in our methods, we can’t possibly know all the factors that could mislead us, so we need to look at our results with a healthy dose of skepticism before we act on them.You should now be thinking about experimenting with prices and estimating subscription lengths correctly to improve customer retention. Take a look at a survival analysis package in your favorite programming language and try it out.And since we now know the metrics we need to use, how do we use them in an experiment?Our next article will be about how to put together a price experiment, and get the right data so you can build a great model like you’ve seen in this article.Happy experimenting!

      "Price Optimization in SaaS: An Introduction.\n",
      "Many SaaS subscription products launch with prices far below their potential value. Maybe they do this to encourage sign-ups. Or perhaps it’s just a stab in the dark. Regardless of the cause, there seems to be a strong potential for increased revenue from price adjustment.But how do we start?This article is the introduction to a series covering various topics relevant to price optimization for subscription businesses. Here is part one! Keep reading to learn how to use data to arrive at an optimal price.Let’s begin by looking at some actual data. Suppose we want to compare price points to see how they affect monthly revenue. Does a certain price point correspond to more revenue? Above is an example of what we might see in a real dataset. The graph comes from data from a Baremetrics customer, represented as a plot of monthly recurring revenue over time.If optimizing subscription pricing is a priority for your business,  start a 14 day free trial with Baremetrics today.The area under the curve represents total monthly revenue. The colors correspond to the share of revenue from customers signed up at different price points. At launch, ten customers lock in a low price (blue). Then the company raises the price by 50% (purple), then by 80% (green).After the first month of changing to the green price, thirteen customers sign up and are already providing more monthly revenue than the other customers combined. It seems that increasing the price results in a lot more monthly revenue. It raises the question, would an even higher price be better?Let’s zoom out and look at another price change this company made:Here they make a big price increase at the beginning of 2020 (pink), six-times the launch price. They try that price for three months. In that time, ten customers join in, and it looks like revenue increases drastically.By March 2020, out of 70 total customers, 10 are signed up at this price and they account for nearly half the monthly revenue.While these examples are not rigorous pricing experiments, they do signal the possibility that the service is underpriced. In each example, raising the price appears to increase monthly revenue, suggesting that the price optimum is even higher than the price represented by pink.These examples are exciting, but we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions about the relationship between price and revenue. It may look like raising the price increases revenue, but many other factors could give this result.For example, these 10 customers that signed up in March 2020 could be caused by a special negotiation by a sales rep. Also, we have only 3 months of data with 10 data points. It’s possible they could churn quickly, or the sale is not repeatable. We need to be more intentional in our price experiments so we can avoid mistaken conclusions.Later in this series of blog posts, we will work out a framework for experimenting with prices. Read on to learn what to measure, what exactly to optimize for, how to experiment, and how to avoid incorrectly interpreting your data.Now that we’ve offered some motivation for experimenting with prices, we need to get more specific about what we are optimizing for.We can apply price optimization to lots of things, for example, maximizing early adopters as part of a long term strategy. But here, we are taking the narrower approach.  Here we are considering the immediate response to our pricing in terms of revenue.In other words, we want to find the price that maximizes our revenue as soon as possible.In this series, we assume that somewhere in the balance of price, and its effect on customer retention and sign up rates, there is an optimum for revenue.Our objective is to find a price closer to it, and explore experimentation around this framework.If price optimization is an area of focus for your company, be sure to check out the rest of our Price Optimization in SaaS series.We’ll cover useful metrics to understand our data correctly and how to set up experiments to test prices. In the absence of experimentation, we will justify some basic guidelines for developing a more optimal price.In the meantime, jump right into finding your best pricing and start your 14 day free trial with Baremetrics today.\n",
      "Dunning Process: What You Need For A Successful Dunning Campaign.\n",
      "If you’re running a subscription or SaaS business, you know that at the end of the day your chief metric is monthly recurring revenue (MRR). And you’d be right to spend your time and resources tracking it.MRR gives your company that forward looking measurement and predictive revenue to actually grow your business. Arguably the biggest factor standing in the way of consistent monthly revenue is your customer churn rate. Churn occurs when an existing subscription is canceled, downgraded, paused, or becomes delinquent. When talking about churn, most people would think to focus on voluntary churn (a customer cancelling a subscription). However, there’s another often forgotten form. That’s involuntary churn and if your company doesn’t zero in on it, it can cause a lot of problems. You may be thinking, “How bad can it be?” According to our data, SaaS and subscriptions businesses lose around 9% of their MRR due to failed payments on average. Think about that. Nine percent of your revenue is potentially just being left on the table month after month. Thankfully, there’s a way to not only drastically reduce involuntary churn, but grow your business while you’re at it. Introducing: a successful dunning process.In this guide, I’ll be taking you through what a dunning process looks like, the importance of dunning, why credit cards actually fail, and the keys to successful dunning campaigns.A dunning process is the manner you go about recovering your customers’ failed payments. What makes the SaaS business model one of the fastest growing markets out there is the convenience of recurring payments and subscription based billing. Yet you and I both know that credit cards are bound to fail eventually. The very thing that makes SaaS great can also be it’s kryptonite. Which is why having a dunning process in place is necessary to not miss out on revenue or lose a customer. Let’s be real. When a payment fails, only two things typically happen:In my experience, most companies are going the option #1 route. How’s that old adage go? “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it?” Well, I think something is broke and it’s time your company does something about it. Before you go and spam 50 customers with emails demanding payments, let’s first talk about why dunning is important.If you know anything about the rep that dunning has, you know that typically it isn’t something that most business owners or customers like. This isn’t because the process itself is useless. In the past, it’s been associated with companies’ approach to dunning overall and not their process. Dunning can easily bring the ‘cold-hearted debt collector’ approach out of anyone who doesn’t watch out. Despite how companies have carried out dunning in the past, it can be a huge boost to your business if done right. It’s essential to understand just what your company gains from having a successful dunning process.As stated before, growing your monthly recurring revenue is the name of the game. In this case, it’s avoiding a loss in revenue to begin with. Not only is losing revenue every month disheartening in and of itself, but when it comes to SaaS, growing your MRR isn’t an easy task to begin with. That ever glamorized “hockey stick growth” you see all over Twitter and elsewhere tends to be a long shot for you and the majority of businesses (no offense). With that being the case, retaining the revenue you do have by avoiding losses isn’t necessarily sexy, but it does keep you afloat.Before coming to the SaaS world, I spent years in non-profits spending a good majority of that time raising funds for organizations. Funny enough, what’s important to any SaaS business is important to all nonprofits as well: happy donors. Happy donors equals consistent donations. Same for you, happy customers equals loyalty to your product. In any business, consistent revenue can be tied to one very important factor: customer satisfaction. The reality is that once someone buys your product or service, it shouldn’t take a failed payment to be the thing that sparks the first touchpoint…ever. Yet a lot of times that might be the case (no shame).Investing time into a dunning process means more customer touch points for you, and the beginning of a relationship as well. The final key benefit of dunning is the fact that you’re actively leaving no money on the table. What do I mean? When a customer’s payment fails and you don’t do something to recover it, you’re essentially letting a sale that you’ve already closed go by the wayside. Why? It’s time to think differently about dunning all together. Rather, start looking at it as you would selling something — it’s a chance to create (well actually recover) revenue for your company.Now that you understand the what and the why of having a dunning process, it’s important to understand one critical element first before getting to the how: why credit cards fail in the first place. Here are the three most common reasons:Card issuer declines happen very frequently. The first reason is the card information is incorrect. That can be anything from the address associated with the card, card number, or expiration date aren’t accurate or filled out in the first place. Due to fraud being common, a card issuer will manage this activity by having customers provide details like CVC and postal codes. These details do drastically decrease the declines your company may be experiencing. The best means to handle these kinds of card failures is to guide your customer to the error or simply use a different card or payment method. A second reason (frankly the most common) for cards failing is the status of the card. Simply put, it’s either expired or cancelled all together. Additionally, some cards may also have restrictions on the type of purchases that can be made. For example, FSA/HSA cards are often limited to certain types of businesses (e.g., healthcare providers), so any other type of purchase would be declined. In these instances, your customer must contact their card issuer to check for any restrictions that may be in place or have a new card issued.The third and final reason a credit card may fail is due to the geographic location of a cardholder in contrast to your company. If your customers are using a card issued in a different country, your company may experience an increased rate of declines. The quickest way to resolve this is for your customers to contact their issuing bank to authorize the charge. Having an understanding as to why a customer’s credit card is failing to begin with will only inform you on the best course of action. Now the only missing piece to the puzzle is putting a successful dunning process in place to recover delinquent payments.Hopefully you’ve come to the conclusion that your company needs a dunning process, like yesterday. If that’s you, let’s get to it! Although being successful at dunning may seem pretty straight forward, there are definitely best practices to put into place. In order to maximize MRR recovered from your campaigns, here are a few things that will ensure success:Most of us have enough individual emails to send every day to begin with. So if you’re not looking for dozens more, I’d consider investing in a dunning management software to handle all your dunning needs. Let’s be real, I couldn’t sit here and mention dunning tools without mentioning our very own here at Baremetrics, Recover.Recover is a one-stop-shop dunning software developed by us. From customized email campaigns, to in-depth analytics on recovery rates, to in-app customer reminders, Recover provides you with the most in-depth dunning tool experience. Don’t just take our word for it. See what others have to say about Recover:And here’s one more for good measure:Just in case you’re interested, here are some other dunning software options:Seriously though, coming from someone who has run dunning campaigns without a dunning tool: save yourself the time and stress. In the end you’ll recover more with a fraction of the time spent. The goal of any email should be to get the recipient to at the very least read it. Considering Mailchimp has found that the average email coming from a software company gets a 2.45% click-rate, you’ll need to be very particular about the content of your dunning emails.The goal of a great dunning email isn’t just to get read, it’s to get billing information updated. To do so, there are key principles to follow:If you want a more in depth look & examples, check out our blog on writing effective dunning emails. Up to this point, you’ve set up a dunning software and nailed a great dunning email, what now? Arguably the most important step is simply being consistent. Emails are easily missed, it happens. Companies begin to lose out on recovering payments when they simply don’t follow up with customers. At the outset, I’d commit to a certain number of emails you’ll send throughout with a certain amount of time between each.My recommendation would be to send at most 6 emails with a 4-6 day window between each (if no reply). Be empathetic and understanding throughout, but don’t be afraid to be forward either as you get later in the campaign. How horrible is it when you receive an update that a payment of yours failed, you go to fix it, and the process to do so is more complicated than the original sign up?When it comes to updating billing information, you want to make it as simple of a process as possible. If it takes more than two clicks for your customers to update their billing information, that’s too many. There are two ways to make this happen:I can sit here and talk until I’m blue in the face (which I will) but the fact still remains: not having a dunning process in your business is a recipe for disaster. This doesn’t have to be a mind-numbing experience either. Going with a tool like Recover or the others mentioned gives you a competitive advantage that most businesses choose to ignore.At the end of the day, the goal of your dunning process should be to help your customer. By avoiding any disturbance in service or creating a great customer experience, your business wins. Not to mention, you get to keep more of that hard earned cash in your company’s pocket with a successful dunning process.\n"

      "How to Transform Multiple Blog Posts Into a Powerful Traffic Generator.\n",
      "It can take an enormous amount of time to build a content strategy that’s meant to deliver on aggressive traffic goals. That’s especially true when you’ve already created a significant amount of content for your blog and are struggling to come up with new topics to write about.What if there was a quicker way to create a unique piece of content without having to start from scratch AND lift your traffic at the same time?If you’re like most growing SaaS companies, you have a pretty deep catalog of blog posts, collecting traffic data just waiting to be analyzed.Much of this content has likely contributed to company growth but at some point, it stopped performing like it used to. There are likely two reasons this may have happened:Either way, you need to take action so that you can continue to get value out of the content that has gotten you to this point. Just because it isn’t performing like it used to doesn’t mean you can’t reclaim that performance and more.In this post, I’m going to explain exactly how you can combat the two reasons listed above by consolidating multiple blog posts into one long-form traffic generator.Content consolidation is the SEO-driven process of combining multiple pieces of content (mainly blog posts) into one larger, long-form evergreen piece of content with the goal of increasing organic traffic.It’s a critical tactic to ensure that your blog is topically deep, while only targeting unique topics on every piece of content that’s created.Marketing teams are always strapped for time. There are just not enough hours in the day to accomplish everything that’s being thrown at them and content creation is no exception. So how do you convince your team that you want to focus your time on updating “old” content?While the benefits may not be initially clear to teams outside of the marketing department, there are plenty that can be communicated to gain strong buy-in.The easiest justification for consolidating content is traffic growth. If you consolidate your content effectively, you should see an increase in traffic within a matter of a few weeks, if not days after publishing. That traffic will compound and you will see your overall website traffic lifted over time.Here's an example of a consolidated post from Baremetrics that saw a near-instant increase in traffic after consolidating and updating older content.You’ll be spending your time more efficiently.There will always be a strong desire to generate brand new content ideas. But a lot of the time, those ideas may have little to no impact on the business. This tactic keeps you focused on topics that have been proven to work and are continually focused on getting more out of them.The end of a successful consolidation project will typically result in a very thorough piece of content on a topic that’s important to your business.This type of content is great for sharing across social accounts with high re-share potential. Also, it creates an opportunity to kick-off an outreach campaign to build new and powerful backlinks to your website. As your company grows, so will your website. It’s important to your ongoing SEO efforts that your website contains only the most relevant and unique pieces of content to your business. If not, it eats up what is commonly known as your search engine “crawl budget” and creates a messy experience for your users. This is an easy way to ensure your website is as lean from a navigation perspective as possible.The performance section of Google Search Console is one of the most powerful tools in a digital marketer’s toolbelt. This is where you’ll find all of the queries and pages that are driving meaningful traffic to your website. In this example, it’s going to be where you find the blog posts that are competing for similar queries. Quickly filter out any branded queries (i.e. use the “does not contain” filter and use your brand name).Sort the filtered results for queries that have a high number of impressions but a very low click-through-rate. Anything with a click-through rate under 1% should be investigated further.Additionally, you’ll want to zero in on queries that aren’t buried too far back in the SERPs. Focus on anything with an average ranking between 20-50.Once you’ve identified all of the queries that appear to have a high potential for optimization, drill into the page report for each one.Here you will be able to quickly see what pages are competing for impressions and clicks on that particular query. If there’s more than one blog post competing for a significant amount of impressions, this is going to be a signal that multiple pieces of content may be covering overlapping or similar topics.Before you go any further, you’ll want to do a quick manual search for the queries you’ve surfaced to see what type of content is being displayed on the 1st page of the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). Things that you’ll want to look for:If the results consistently surface more comprehensive guides on a specific topic, you can feel confident that you should be consolidating the content you’ve identified into a unique, long-form piece of content. Typically, if there are multiple pieces of content competing for impressions and clicks, there’s likely some overlapping content ideas in each post.Review each post to see if it matches content that’s addressed in the comprehensive content you saw in the SERPs from the previous step.That will start to give you an idea of how to structure your new piece of content.At this point, you should have a strong understanding of how you can consolidate your content into one comprehensive guide on a specific topic.Most likely, any post that you may be consolidating into a larger piece can exist as “new” section within that guide. Be sure to give your content a fresh new title that matches the new content that you’ve added.Below is a screenshot of what it looks like when you run through the above process successfully. In this example, content was consolidated into an existing post that was a bit more comprehensive than the internal competition. The URL was updated and everything was redirected to the new content.There are a few key things to keep in mind to ensure that you’re content consolidation efforts are successful. Before going through the steps above, be sure to consider the following:If your website authority is below 35, your content may not move up in rankings as much as you’d like and may still require additional work. You may need to prioritize initiatives that can help increase your website authority before investing a ton of time into content conslidation. When consolidating multiple blog posts into a comprehensive guide, be sure to structure your content appropriately with logical header structure (i.e. H2s, H3s, H4s), and ordered/unordered lists. This will enhance the user experience and helps search engines understand what the content is about. Make sure to implement a 301 redirect on any content that is moving to a new location. This will ensure that any current traffic is redirected to the new post and existing backlinks aren’t broken.In your research, you’ll likely see that you don’t have some existing content to make your new guide as comprehensive as it needs to be. Be sure to add as much new content that your research suggests to stay competitive and make your topic as deep as possible.The process of consolidating content is not only a very effective tactic to grow your traffic, but it’s something that you can and should be doing on an ongoing basis. Ultimately you’re optimizing your user experience and keeping your website in the best shape possible. Both of those things will never go out of style or become obsolete.\n",
      "How This Membership Business Grew to $23K MRR With Content Marketing.\n",
      "Product Marketing Alliance first came onto the scene in March 2019 to fill a gap in the market. Product marketing had been a ‘thing’ for a long, long time, but people in the industry didn’t have the one go-to place for information tailored to them.No-one was providing product marketers with the network and resources they needed to really refine their craft and come together, and so that’s exactly what we did.We started by asking a small group of people from our community if this is something they would be interested in.Everyone was instantly really excited because the other communities that were already out there were specific to certain regions. There was nothing out there on a global scale, so we took those insights and used them to fuel something truly global.So we created a platform whereby product marketers all over the world could get together, learn, share, even vent, and really level up not only the products they market, but their career. We started by simply listening and unpacking what product marketing actually is, and the rest is history.From day one we’ve taken an agile approach and we’re constantly listening to what those inside and out of our community want and are adapting our approach based on this kind of feedback. It isn’t rocket science really, but we just listen out for trends and when we spot one, we act quick, and that’s the beauty of being a startup in that we can consistently do that.In terms of how we actually do that listening, it’s a real mix. We obviously make use of our own Slack community, we also have Customer Advisory Boards, use social listening, amalgamate trends we see in feedback forms and reviews, and so on. Fast forward to where we are today, at the time of writing, our community is home to 30,000+ product marketers globally, each of our reports gets at least 5,000 downloads, 1000s of new and seasoned PMMs pick our course to get PMM certified, and our membership plans reached $23,000+ MRR within eight months of launching.Things scaled real quick.Our journey started by listening, and our journey’s continued on its trajectory because we’ve continued to listen. Our PMMs said they wanted reports, so we gave them reports. They asked for podcasts, we delivered. Masterclasses, membership plans, digital events, certification, AMAs, articles, you name it, it’s born from appetite within the community.It’s nothing revolutionary, but it’s something many businesses all too easily bypass. We listened, we never stopped, and our deliverables back up that the word ‘listen’ isn’t just lip service with us.For the first 10 months of our existence, we didn’t offer any paid products. Through podcasts, articles, reports and events, we very much took a content-first approach. We wanted to provide totally free resources that added value and answered the questions our community were asking.We gauged success using a few metrics. First and foremost was the numbers for the week on week growth of our Slack community as this was our constant. Outside of that, we’d look at things like site traffic. As we continued to consistently produce value-added content, we started to see our traffic increase and increase. And not just sporadically, this was month-on-month increases and those numbers continue to rise to this day. What’s helped us here is the consistency. Yes, we have the hallmark content like the State of Product Marketing report that helped us establish ourselves and is something people continue to reference and look forward to, but outside that we continue to add value day in, day out, in all sorts of ways - articles, podcasts, AMAs, webcasts, you name it. In terms of which types of content were our growth levers in the early days, it would definitely be our reports. We published our first State of Product Marketing report just a few months after PMA was born and it hit 5,000 downloads in no time. For a company of our age at the time, that was a really strong number and really put us on the map. A few months after that, we followed up with our Product Marketing Salary Survey and this again flew off the shelf, getting more than 7,000 downloads in an incredibly short space of time. These reports filled gaping gaps in the product marketing industry and addressing those gaps really helped us solidify our mission and presence on the product marketing scene. Fast-forward to where we are today, we produce 10 reports a year and each continues to consistently hit 1,000s of unique downloads. In the early days, it was the kind of content that helped define product marketing that really went down well because there just wasn’t anything out there that did that well and brought real clarity to the role. While that kind of content continues to be hugely popular, we’re seeing increasing popularity in the kind of content that addresses problems on a more granular level.So not just content for product marketers in general, but content created specifically for product marketers who operate in certain verticals, or are a specific stage in their career.It wasn’t until the very end of January 2020 that we officially launched our first paid-for product; our membership plans. By this point, we had built a name for ourselves and we were a trusted resource within the industry and this trust was our growth lever. Before we went all-in with our full-blown launch, we gave a number of our founding members access to our membership portal for free so that we could gather feedback on the go and continue to iterate what was inside before we went out to the masses. Again, nothing revolutionary, but when we listened, we acted, and that enabled us to build a product that genuinely added value.In terms of the kind of feedback we got, people were telling us they were a little overwhelmed when they logged into their dashboard. Because we had so many resources in there, they just didn’t know where to start. We didn’t necessarily view this as a bad thing of course, because we knew all the content in there would be tremendously valuable to them, but it was just about presenting it in a more manageable way. To try and combat this, we spent some time really refining the searchability side of the site so that our members could quickly and easily search for and find what they needed, when they needed it, without being too inundated by the wealth of content in between.As is the case with all our products, outside of the usual growth tactics (email, social, paid, etc.) our product eventually started to sell itself, and we now have companies like Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, Typeform, and Amazon in there.People who purchased our membership plans were digging what they got and they wanted to tell people about it. We leveraged this by using social proof as our main selling mechanism and you’ll notice we do this across board. It’s no secret people prefer hearing the words of their peers than companies, so we doubled down on this. Going back to that initial launch, within 24 hours of announcing our membership plans were on the market, we had 100 paying customers! In the seven days following that, we had a further 100 paying members. Fast-forward to 11 months later and we reached over $23,000 MRR.We’re very fortunate in that our community has, and continues to grow organically. We say fortunately, but that’s in no small part to how we’ve kept it engaged.We have strict house rules in place within our community and our community managers are incredibly hot on the pulse in ensuring these are enforced. We want our community to be a place where people can speak freely, answer openly, and not be sold to.In the early days, I managed the community myself. Then we hired a full-time copywriter who helped out a bit. We didn’t hire a full-time community manager until a year after launching. We made this decision when we knew we were stretching ourselves too thin on areas of PMA outside of the Slack community (reports, courses, membership, etc.) to maintain the ethos and standards of our Slack community.What was hugely beneficial for us though is the commitment and enthusiasm of the members of our community. If people were violating the community rules, our members would let us know immediately. As the community scaled so quickly, this community-wide support was invaluable. Outside of our Slack community, we keep the community alive by:When we’re planning out upcoming activities, we do this based on chatter we physically see going down in the community, but also by outright asking “what do you want?”. This helps us ensure what we’re doing is aligned with the community’s needs. For example, we saw lots of people asking about other people’s PM:PMM ratios, so we ran a poll on LinkedIn.We turned those poll results into this piece. And we noticed OKRs were a pretty big sticking point, so we wrote this eBook. Honestly, so much of what we do is based on these kinds of interaction there’d be too many examples to give!We’re always flat out behind the scenes working on our next launch - whether that be a course, or piece of content, or event, but we don’t ever skimp on quality and that really comes through when we look at the numbers and feedback.\n"

      "What is Net Revenue Churn (And How Does it Impact Your Business)?.\n",
      "We get it: you’re probably already tracking your fair share of KPIs.And you’re likewise tired of hearing that this or that metric is the most important to watch.Rather than overwhelm yourself with individual numbers without context, it’s crucial that founders keep an eye on metrics that answer specific, actionable questions.“How stable and sustainable is my business?”“Are our customers satisfied and engaged with our product?”“Is our company financially healthy?”Well, tracking your net revenue churn rate can clue you in on all of the above.In this guide, we’ll highlight how to calculate yours and why this unique data point is a strong signal of your business’ long-term growth.There are a lot of moving pieces here, but you’re basically measuring your churn rate minus expansion.Keep in mind that it’s possible to end up with a negative MRR churn rate. This occurs when your expansion MRR exceeds your monthly churn. For example, let’s say the revenue boost from a dozen customers upgrading their accounts offsets the revenue lost from a handful of churned customers elsewhere.As noted in our guide to negative churn, this is a rare case where a low (or even negative) number is actually a good thing and not a red flag.Below is the basic formula for calculating net revenue churn(Churned MRR - Expansion MRR) ÷ Starting MRR 30 days ago x 100Like any other metric related to MRR, you should ideally track your net revenue churn on a monthly basis for the sake of spotting trends.The formula above illustrates another key point about net revenue churn: calculating it requires you to already be tracking a whole slew of SaaS metrics. If you don’t already have your churned and expansion MRR handy (and your past month’s MRR), you’re going to have to do some digging (and likewise whip out a calculator).This is where a tool like Baremetrics can be a life-saver. Tracking all of your must-see SaaS metrics side-by-side, our tool automatically calculates your net revenue churn alongside the other data points noted in our formula.Fair question! Again, it might be futile to try to “rank” net revenue churn versus other KPIs.What makes net revenue churn notable is the fact that it encourages you to take a more holistic view of your business.Many companies primarily measure and report on gross churn. This doesn’t give you the full picture of your business’ health, though. Think about it. A churn rate of 3% or 6% might be cause for concern depending on your business, but means something totally different if it’s being outpaced by expansion revenue. This speaks to why net revenue churn matters so much in terms of perspective and how you approach customers as a whole.Rather than obsess over “How do we keep customers from churning?” you can focus on the question of “How do we get more revenue from our existing customers?” It’s kind of like the “scarcity versus abundance” mindset. Remember that churn is an inevitable part of the SaaS business model. You can’t eliminate it outright. It’s arguably more proactive (for the sake of your business and sanity) to focus on expanding the value of your customers rather than fixate on losing them.No huge surprises here. Regularly checking in with customers not only helps you build better relationships, but also makes it easier to drive upsells. From plan upgrades to new features and limited-time offers, don’t neglect the power of asking.Upsells don’t have to mean reinventing the wheel, either. Heck, Baremetrics managed to see a staggering 30% annual upgrade increase by rolling out a relatively simple coupon campaign (see below).This tip piggybacks on the point above. Simply having the option for customers to upgrade to bigger and better plans as they grow means that there’s always a looming opportunity to increase your MRR. As highlighted by our upsell email, longer-term contracts (think: not month-to-month) obviously means that you can enjoy that revenue boost for longer.Meanwhile, offering lower-tier plans allows you to lower churn by empowering customers to downgrade versus cancel outright. Either way, a tiered pricing structure gives you the best of both worlds.Spoiler alert: you don’t need to totally transform your business or build an entirely new product for the sake of expansion.In fact, there are probably some premium services you could introduce ASAP to offset churn such as:Meanwhile, Zendesk promotes custom add-ons which are off-shoots of their other products.We’ll bite: SaaS pricing is complicated and price increases of any shape or form shouldn’t be taken lightly.That said, a well-executed increase can be worthwhile in the long-run. We’ve seen firsthand how a small pricing tweak can even result in tripled revenues.Generally speaking, lower-cost customers tend to produce more churn. You can see in the example below our lower-tier plan has more revenue churn than our mid-tier plans.Last but not least, you need to have a constant pulse on your churn rate and whether or not your customers are at large are in danger of cancelling. Once you’ve grown to a point where your churn is stable and under control, you can focus more on expansion.This again highlights why a tool like Baremetrics is so important. Rather than let any of your crucial KPIs fly under the radar, we keep them all front and center for you.A significant data point that signals the overall health of your business, tracking your net revenue churn rate should be a top priority. Based on your month-to-month performance, you can prioritize some of the interventions we mentioned above in additional tactics such as cancellation surveys, email campaigns and more.And it all starts by analyzing your data with Baremetrics.\n",
      "Customer Churn: How to Calculate & Reduce It.\n",
      "Nobody wants to watch their customers walk away.Duh, right? Lost subscriptions are an inevitable part of doing business as a SaaS company.But keep in mind that businesses don’t typically face a flood of cancellations overnight. Instead, it’s a gradual drift of customers that snowball into a more serious problem.That’s exactly why businesses should keep a close eye on customer churn.In this guide, we’ll break down how to calculate your customer churn rate (and the actionable steps you can take to reduce yours).Customer churn represents the rate that customers cancel their subscription to your service. In short, churn measures the percentage of people who’ve left over a period of time (typically month-to-month).Below is a quick customer churn formula that you can use to calculate the percentage yourself:Customers that churned over a period of time / Customers at the start of that time period = Customer churn rate (%)From lapsed billing and back-end product issues to lackluster customer service, a creeping churn rate can clue you in on issues where your company can immediately intervene. Without a pulse on your customer churn, such problems can slip right under your nose. No surprises here. With a relatively consistent customer churn rate, you have a better idea of what your MRR will be and whether or not your business is growing at a consistent rate. Although some churn is inevitable, a lower churn rate obviously means more revenue and the likelihood of longer-term, loyal customers.Food for thought: 80% of customers state that the experience a company provides is just as important as their product or service.Actively reducing churn means spending more time interacting with customers. Doing so not only allows you to build meaningful relationships with your buyers, but also uncover opportunities to improve your business, such as:Taking the initiative to do all of the above starts by both measuring your churn rate and understanding whether you’re at risk for mass customer migration.There is no right answer here. Your industry, price point and other factors all play a part. That said, we do have some firsthand insight via our own Open Benchmarks with data from actual SaaS companies. In Baremetrics, you can compare your churn rate against companies with a similar average revenue per user (ARPU). Here’s an example of what ours looks like:Remember that you can’t avoid churn altogether. This is especially true for newer companies still in the process of building a base.And if you’re unhappy with your customer churn rate or still struggle with long-term retention, you don’t have to panic.This is not only a no-brainer, but also an immediate intervention your company can take.The concept here is simple: when your customers cancel, prompt them to explain why they’ve decided to walk away (via email, input form, etc). Doing so in good faith represents an opportunity to figure out how your business can improve. Below is an example of a subscription cancellation email via Baremetrics. Our platform makes it a cinch to not only roll out such autoresponders, but turn your cancellations into data points via our Cancellation Insights feature which highlights the “why” behind your lost customers.If nothing else, cancellation messages can create a bit of lag time. This gives you a chance to actually talk one-on-one with a would-be churned customer and resolve the issue. The caveat here? Forcing customers to go through this process can be tedious for people who are committed to their decision to walk away. Either way, this is a prime example of how customer conversations can highlight bigger-picture problems that could be impacting the rest of your buyers.Customer expectations are arguably higher than ever.This rings true when it comes to both response time and personalizing your interactions.That means spending actual time talking to people, not blasting one-size-fits-all service messages and “solutions.”From email to social media and beyond, speedy responses (think: minutes and hours, not days) should be a top priority.The idea here is pretty straightforward: more frequent check-ins mean more opportunities to interact with customers and identify potential issues.You can’t assume that customers will always reach out even if there’s a problem (or if they even have the bandwidth to do so.) Check-ins don’t mean bombarding people with calls or sales messages, though. Instead, companies should try to nudge customers and frame their outreach as positive and proactive. You can actually automate this process through winback emails which are triggered based on your customers’ inaction (see below). Your CRM can likewise highlight customers you haven’t talked to recently and might be due for a check-in.Piggybacking on the previous tip, consider creating a criteria for customers who are at risk for churning. This means finding common threads between churned customers and likewise keeping a close eye on how often your customers interact with your product.For example, a sample criteria might include the following:No matter what sect of SaaS you’re in, customers are likely spoiled for choice in terms of competing products.Consider rewards and loyalty incentives for your early adopters or people who’ve committed to your service for a certain period of time (think: a year or more). These incentives might include premium customer service, additional features or grandfathering them into premium plans at their existing rates.You obviously can’t do this with everyone, but these strategies can help give VIP treatment to your most valuable customers.Making a conscious effort to monitor your churn rate is perhaps the most important tip toward improving it.Because you can’t know where you’re going until you know where you’ve been.This is exactly where a tool like Baremetrics can help. Our SaaS dashboard showcases your user churn rate alongside a slew of other metrics month-to-month including MRR, ARPU and LTV (to name a few).Having all of your growth metrics in one place means that you’re never caught off guard by irregularities. Beyond that, our easy-to-read graphs and real-time reports are easy to understand at a glance. This makes sharing your data with colleagues and stakeholders a cinch.Not only that, but our platform highlights where you stand versus competing businesses in your space. We let you know loud and clear where there’s room for improvement.Listen: your customer churn rate isn’t something you can let go under your radar.By keeping an eye on it in Baremetrics and sticking to the retention tips above, you can set yourself up for more loyal, longer-term customers.\n"

      "Growing in a Crowded Niche: Hypefury Growth Story.\n",
      "Hypefury is a SaaS tool in a very competitive space—social media marketing.The list of social media tools for analytics, publishing, automation and engagement is long and seemingly never ending with new companies popping up every week. Plus, there are a handful of really popular (and well funded) companies that dominate.With all that, Hypefury managed to get a slice of the pie and the business recently hit a huge milestone—$10K MRR!I found the Hypefury story particularly interesting because I used to work in their industry, so I know just how competitive and difficult it can be to stand out. Plus, the fact that they’re an Open Startup and a Baremetrics customer made it even more appealing. So I connected with one of their co-founders, Yannick, to learn more about how they took Hypefury from an idea to a growing SaaS company in an ultra competitive industry.You can read his story below, plus my takeaways. Enjoy! Hypefury helps solopreneurs save time and automate their social media experience. Before getting the idea for Hypefury, my co-founder, Samy Dindane, started his first side business helping busy men get in shape. He learned a ton and met a lot of people on Twitter. That’s when he asked this question:Are there any scheduling apps that do Twitter threads?Turned out there weren’t any solutions, but it was something that people wanted. That was the moment we knew there was a market for it and started working on the product. Hypefury started out as a simple “scheduler” but quickly transitioned into an automation tool.Takeaway Sometimes you don’t have to be the biggest player in an entire industry. Instead of trying to make the “best social media tool” that served every social network, Hypefury zeroed in on Twitter automation. And to take it one step forward, their initial differentiator was the ability to schedule Twitter threads, which nobody else was doing at the time.Find a specific problem you can solve in an industry and become the go-to solution for it.Hypefury is a self-funded business. The expenses to start an online business these days are not a lot.  We used Google Firebase for our app and affordable WordPress hosting for our marketing websites. You can get credits for different services you use like Firebase and there are many startup plans you can take advantage of like Intercom’s. Once we had a bit more room in our recurring revenue we started hiring people. Neither Samy or I take any salary yet. Otherwise we couldn’t grow the business as fast as we want. Our first hires were more developers. We’re in a competitive space and we needed to stay ahead of the competition. As our customer base grew we couldn’t keep up with the support tickets and hired a customer success person. That first hire wasn’t a good match. Luckily we met someone during our journey who was interested in helping us with customer success. He turned out to be a great fit.TakeawayOne of the benefits of starting a SaaS company today is it doesn’t cost as much as most people think. Hypefury was able to bootstrap by taking advantage of lower cost tools and not growing beyond their means.Think about the resources your business needs in order to function, and avoid spending money on unnecessary tools or hiring too fast. Be willing to sacrifice upfront for the long term benefits.We didn’t explicitly ask people if they were willing to pay for Hypefury, but we knew Buffer and Hootsuite were huge companies building generic schedulers. We could carve out a piece of that pie for Hypefury.If people on Twitter were shelling out money for a generic scheduler, they would definitely want to pay for a Twitter-specific version that met much more of their needs.After just a couple of days, the MVP was ready. Samy invited about 10 people to the closed beta that expressed interest from his initial Tweet about scheduling Twitter threads. Those first couple of users were excited, became fans and helped shape Hypefury in its early days.They shared ideas on how to improve the product.TakeawayIf you want to find out whether or not people are willing to pay for your product, get some initial users and learn from them. They’ll become your sounding board for whether or not you’re building something people value.This is particularly helpful if you’re nervous about charging for your MVP yet.Because there’s a pretty big market for social media scheduling and automation, we compared our pricing to businesses like Buffer and Hootsuite. We haven’t changed our pricing yet in over a year and are now in the process of adding new tiers and changing prices based on how much value we bring.We also based our pricing on intuition. We compared Hypefury to other existing tools and to what the market usually spends (for example, the price of the scheduler compared to the price of an ebook).Our main value when we started out was to save people’s time. We’re now transitioning into a business where we also drive more and more revenue for our users though Hypefury.TakeawayPricing is always a tough decision, but it doesn’t have to be. Hypefury looked around at what similar tools were priced at and went for it.The market will let you know if you’ve priced your tool too high or too low. Check out our SaaS pricing guide for more tips on how to choose the right pricing model.After that initial beta group of about 10 people, Samy invited over 50 or so more people to try Hypefury. Twenty of those kept using the product so he knew he was on to something. Their word of mouth became a catalyst to get to our first 100 users. After the initial 100 customers, we implemented an affiliate program that started the second wave of growth. We’re on a viral platform and if we keep delivering our users with great value, they’ll keep talking and mentioning us. Having an extra financial incentive adds to that viral coefficient. People talk about us even quicker 🙂We also launched a free course on how to build a Twitter audience. Anyone who downloads the course is added to an email funnel where we get people interested in using Hypefury. Here’s an example email from the funnel. We try to make a connection with the people and also try to gauge what they think is important.We create blog articles around the biggest topics in our niche and pay a lot of attention to SEO so we can grow our traffic numbers from unpaid sources.Recently we started a podcast where we interview interesting people on Twitter. The podcast is geared towards people who want to grow their audience and business through Twitter.A lot of our current users have interesting stories. We give them a platform for their story and they tell our (and their) audience how they use Hypefury.TakeawayGetting your first customers is one of the biggest challenges SaaS companies face. In the early days, building buzz through word of mouth is usually the most cost effective way to get initial growth. But you shouldn’t just rely on one growth channel.Hypefury uses word of mouth, content, social media and affiliate marketing. Experiment with multiple growth tactics to see what works best.Our biggest challenge was what to choose to prioritize. We had many different users who all had other wants and needs. We didn’t really have a system in place to choose what to focus on so we just did a lot of requests. We decided to start using Acute as a way to gather feedback from our users and to gauge what features would have a bigger impact and were less time consuming to build.TakeawayAs your SaaS company grows, you’re going to face new challenges. The faster you can put systems and processes in place, the fewer headaches you’ll have down the road.We keep track of our revenue and growth numbers through Baremetrics of course 🙂 Beyond that, our two most important metrics are Daily Active Users and average number of tweets scheduled.We’re now focussing on getting new users to schedule at least 10 tweets within the first few days of starting their trial because it’s a good indicator of becoming a paid user. \n",
      "What is Negative Churn? (And How to Achieve it).\n",
      "Generally speaking, you don’t want your SaaS metrics to be negative.Negative daily active users? Bad.Negative revenue? Horrible.Negative net revenue churn? Amazing!Net revenue churn is the exception to the rule, and it’s one of the few times you’ll hear founders get excited about a KPI being in the negative.So, why does everyone have such a positive attitude about negative churn? Read on to find out:Let’s set the stage with a couple of quick definitions. There are two types of churn:When we talk about negative churn, we’re specifically talking about revenue churn (aka MRR churn). It’s important to differentiate between the two, because negative customer churn isn’t really a thing. Now that we have that out the way, let’s dive in.Negative churn is when the amount of new revenue from your existing customers is greater than the revenue you lose from cancellations and downgrades.Unless you’ve built the perfect product and all your customers are willing to pay you the same price (or more) forever, you’re going to experience revenue churn at some point. But when you’re able to get additional revenue from your existing customers through upgrades and cross-sells, it counterbalances the revenue you lose to churn.A lot of the times when SaaS businesses think about churn, the focus is “how do we keep as many customers and as much revenue as possible?” Net negative revenue churn forces you to also think about how you can expand the revenue you get from your current customers which shifts you from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset.If your expansion MRR is greater than your churned MRR, you’ll get a negative number, which means you gained more revenue from existing customers than you lost.Here’s an example.Let’s say your company has 100 customers, with a $50/month revenue per customer. That’s a total MRR of $5,000. Two of those customers cancel, resulting in $100 in churned MRR.But three other customers upgrade their accounts and are now paying $100/month, resulting in $150 in expansion MRR.Let’s plug these numbers into our formula:If you’re like me, you probably don’t want to deal with calculations. Even if you have a spreadsheet to track it all, it’s still messy.Luckily, there are tools for that. Shameless plug, we have one.You can track your net revenue churn in Baremetrics and see how it changes over time. You can even see a live demo of what the dashboard looks like here.If you want to get really fancy, you can segment your customers and see exactly what’s contributing to your negative churn.For instance, if we wanted to compare revenue churn for customers who don’t use one of our add-on products, we can add in those segments.Looking at this data, we can see that if we were to get the customers not using our add-on products to sign up, we could reduce our net revenue churn even more.Slicing the data with segments is a great way to do some in-depth churn analysis that can change the trajectory of your business. If you’re interested in analyzing your churn and other metrics, you can see all your data with a free trial!If you’ve gotten to this point you might be thinking “Ok, that all sounds great. But how do I actually get my net revenue churn to be negative?”It all goes back to the formula I mentioned earlier. There are two inputs:In order to get it in the negative, you need to optimize the inputs so that your churned MRR is lower than your expansion MRR.In other words, you need to lower your revenue churn and increase your expansion revenue.Here’s how to do it.No matter how low your revenue churn rate is, you’ll never achieve negative churn without increasing your MRR from existing customers.So step one needs to be customer expansion.For most SaaS companies, customer expansion comes from these three strategies:Here’s my favorite graphic to illustrate the difference between them.Upgrades are the most common ways to increase expansion MRR. If you have a tiered pricing model, your goal should be to get customers to upgrade their account over time.Depending on your product, this can be difficult or easy.For instance, look at a product like Later.They have three pricing tiers.Each tier gives you more posts per social profile and more users. Ideally, as their customers grow their social media accounts, they’ll need to post more and grow their team, so account upgrades are inevitable.Compare that to Docusign, who also uses tiered pricing. But their prices are based on features.If someone signs up for the Standard account, they’ll only need to upgrade if they want to try new features.Later’s approach has expansion baked into their pricing model, while Docusign’s customers might need a little more of a “push” to upgrade.Both approaches work, but Later’s is a little more automated.Cross-selling is a good way to increase expansion MRR if you have (or want to make) additional products to complement your flagship one.Baremetrics is a good example of this. We have a couple of other products we offer that fit well with our primary metrics product—Recover for dunning management and Cancellation Insights for reducing churn.Both of these can be purchased on their own, but when you combine them with our metrics, they’re insanely more valuable.For our customers who use our metrics but not our add-ons, we give them the ability to add-on either within their account.Buffer is another company that started cross-selling a while ago. For a long time, they had their flagship product that allows you to schedule social media posts. Now, they have an additional product that allows you to analyze the content you’re publishing.As you can see with both of these examples, cross-selling works with products that are a natural extension of your main SaaS product.Think of additional subscription products you can offer on top of your main offering that’ll help your customers get even more value. You could even send a survey to your current customers and ask them for ideas.Last but not least are add-ons. Unlike cross-selling, add-ons are additional features or extras that build on top of a customer’s current plan.The best example of this is seat expansion. That’s when a SaaS company charges for additional users, like Ahrefs.Be careful with add-ons though. You can risk coming off like the greedy company that’s trying to nickel and dime customers for every little thing if you go overboard. Your customers should be able to get value out of your base product regardless of whether or not they pay for add-ons.The other part of the negative churn puzzle is reducing your revenue churn rate. The less MRR you lose each month, the less additional MRR you need to make up for with customer expansion.For instance, a company that’s churning $1,000/month needs to get at least that amount in expansion revenue to get close to a net negative churn rate.Also, don’t fall into the mistake of thinking you can just rely on expansion revenue to fix your churn problem. If you have a 10% churn rate, the chances of you making that up with expansion revenue are slim.So, how do you reduce revenue churn?A good place to start is to find out why customers are cancelling or downgrading in the first place.Here’s how we do it at Baremetrics.Whenever a customer cancels, we send a cancellation survey to find out why.We use our Cancellation Insights add-on to automate the process, which you can check out here if you’re interested.One reason I really like Cancellation Insights is because it allows you to see exactly how much recurring revenue you’re losing each month for specific reasons.You can use that data to prioritize what changes to make first, starting with the cancellation reasons costing you the most money.Over time, your revenue churn rate should go down which will get you one step closer to achieving negative churn!Yes, having a negative revenue churn rate is nice. But it’s not something every SaaS company achieves, and definitely not on a consistent basis.We’ve had negative net revenue churn in certain months, but most months it’s not. And that’s ok.Your ultimate goal should be to retain and expand as many customers as possible, while also acquiring new ones (at a reasonable customer acquisition cost of course). If you can do that long term, you’ll grow. And if you can do it while keeping your revenue churn negative, even better!\n"

      "7 Best SaaS Billing Systems.\n",
      "In the early days of running a software company, collecting payments was pretty straightforward.A customer buys a license for your software, and they get the product (either through a download, a CD or even more old school—floppy disks).Fast forward to today when most software companies use a SaaS (Software as a Service) business model,  and things aren’t as simple.You have to deal with recurring payments, multiple pricing plans, annual vs monthly payments, add-ons, variable payments and the list goes on.To put it simply, recurring billing can get complicated, especially for a SaaS company.Luckily, like most complex processes and tasks, it can be simplified. Let's dive in!Think of the steps a customer goes through in order to subscribe to your SaaS product. First, they choose a plan and a payment method. Then, their billing information needs to be collected so you can charge them. And finally, their subscription needs to be “stored” or saved somewhere so you can charge them monthly and manage things like upgrades, downgrades and discounts.Each step requires a different system:And when you combine them all, it creates a seamless process that’s automated and happens in the background.Here’s a quick overview of each system, in non-technical jargon:A payment gateway is the system that allows your customers to send their payment information securely. When your customers enter their credit card and billing information, the payment gateway tells their bank “this is how much we need to charge”. PayPal and Stripe are both examples of payment gateways.A merchant account is an account your customer’s payment goes into (i.e. how you receive the payment). In other words, your customer says “hey I want to pay you for a subscription” and your merchant account says “cool, you can put that money in here”.Most of the time, merchant accounts are provided by your payment gateway provider so it’s pretty hands off for you. For instance, Stripe and Braintree offer both payment gateways and merchant accountsA subscription management platform allows you to charge your customer’s billing information on a monthly basis.Think of it this way. When you make a one-off purchase from an e-commerce company, they only need to charge you once. But when customers sign up for a SaaS subscription, they need to be charged every month, year, or whatever payment cycle they’re on.The subscription management system allows you to manage that process.Recurly is an example of a subscription management tool for SaaS.The last part of the system, that’s optional but highly recommended, is a SaaS analytics tool. A SaaS analytics tool works on top of your subscription management system.Your subscription management system holds and collects a ton of data, but they’re usually not the best at organizing and presenting it to you in a way that you can analyze it. SaaS analytics tools fill that gap.They allow you to analyze MRR, churn and other SaaS metrics important to your growth. Here’s the way I like to think about it.You have a bank or credit card that you use to make payments. Your statement will show you all your transaction information. But if you want to analyze that data and look for trends so you can budget smarter, make better investments and just be in an overall better financial position, you’d use a budgeting tool like Mint or YNAB.SaaS analytic tools do a similar thing, but for your business rather than your personal finances. Baremetrics is an example of a SaaS analytics tool. You sync up your subscription management platform and our software organizes it all so you can see your metrics in real time, analyze the data and make smarter decisions to grow your business.Ok, so now you know the different parts of SaaS billing. The next step is choosing the right subscription billing service (or services) to collect payments for your SaaS business.There are a ton of different tools out there, each with their own pros and cons. Some will be a payment gateway but not include a merchant account. Some might be just a subscription management system, but not a payment gateway or merchant account.It can get confusing.In order to help, we’ve gone through top review sites and broken down seven of the best SaaS billing services on the market. We’ll go over what differentiates them, the costs and some pros and cons of each service.Stripe is probably the most popular SaaS billing system. It works as a payment gateway, merchant account and subscription management platform. Plus, it has some lightweight analytics features.Part of the reason Stripe billing is so popular is that it's fairly easy to set up and their usage based pricing makes it easy for any SaaS startup to sign up and start using them.Stripe charges a fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. They have additional fees for other services like instant payout, advanced fraud detection and more.Stripe is a good fit for most SaaS companies, particularly if you’re just starting out. There’s no monthly fee, it’s easy to set up and it integrates with tools you’re probably already using to run your business.Stripe reviewsBraintree is owned by PayPal, and has grown to become kind of a Stripe alternative for SaaS companies. Similar to Stripe, Braintree is a payment gateway, merchant account and subscription management platform.Since it’s a subsidiary of PayPal, you get the added benefit of being able to offer PayPal for payments. Braintree also works well for mobile apps, in addition to traditional SaaS.Braintree charges a fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.Braintree is good for international SaaS companies, or SaaS companies that want to accept PayPal payments. Or if you just don’t want to use Stripe for some reason, Braintree is an alternative option.Braintree reviewsRecurly is a subscription management system that gives you more features than you’ll get from all-in-one SaaS billing options like Stripe and Braintree for managing recurring billing.However, in order to use Recurly, you’ll need to have a payment gateway and Merchant account. Meaning you’ll likely use Recurly on top of a service like Stripe or Braintree.The benefit though, is you’ll get better reporting, full-on subscription management and more flexibility for different billing models. For instance, whether you offer usage-based pricing, tiered pricing, or some type of hybrid, Recurly can be set up to manage billing for any of them.Recurly starts at $149 per month, plus 0.9% of revenue.Recurly is an option for subscription businesses that have a payment gateway and merchant account, but want more subscription management options.Recurly reviewsChargebee is a subscription management system for handling SaaS subscriptions and recurring billing. Similar to Recurly, Chargebee is not a payment gateway or merchant account provider, so you’ll need to use it on top of another service.One of the biggest upsides of Chargebee however, is they specifically cater to SaaS businesses. They have options for pricing experimentation, upselling, revenue recognition, managing trials and more.So Chargebee isn’t just collecting and organizing your subscriptions, it makes it easier to test and optimize your SaaS billing strategy as well.Chargebee has monthly and annual plans, starting at $249/month (for annual plans). That includes $600K in annual revenue and 0.6% of any monthly revenue over that.Chargebee also offers a free plan for under $50K in MRR.Chargebee is a good option for SaaS companies that want to experiment with different pricing and activation models.Chargebee reviews2Checkout (now Verifone) is an online payment processor that handles everything from selling physical products to digital goods and subscription services. While they offer a line of products, the one for SaaS companies is called 2Subscribe, which is for recurring revenue businesses. It’s a complete SaaS billing solution that covers your payment gateway, merchant account and subscription management.They’re geared more towards enterprise SaaS companies than smaller startups (as noted through their website copy), but that comes with its own set of benefits. For instance, you can accept payments from over 200 countries and you have access to their affiliate network to get more exposure for your SaaS product.The 2Subscribe plan charges 4.5% + $0.45 per transaction.2Checkout is a good option for larger SaaS companies that want a more enterprise SaaS billing solution.2Subscribe reviewsChargify is a subscription management platform specifically for B2B SaaS companies. Unlike some of the other subscription billing services on our list, Chargify is one of the few that speaks to a very specific type of recurring revenue business.Chargify doesn’t offer a payment gateway or merchant account, so you’ll need to use it on top of another service.Chargify starts at $149 per month for up to $10K in MRR, plus 1.5% of any overages.Chargify is a good fit for B2B SaaS companies with complex billing needs.Chargify reviewsAuthorize.net is a payment gateway offered by Visa. While it doesn’t have a built-in merchant account, they have a list of merchant account partners you can choose from.While SaaS businesses aren’t their target customer, Authorize.net can be an interesting solution for certain edge-cases. For instance, if you already have a merchant account and you’re using something like Recurly to manage your subscriptions.However, for the price, a lot of SaaS companies will be better off with some of the other options on the list.Authorize.net costs $25 per month, and a fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for both a payment gateway and merchant account.Alternatively, if you just want to use the payment gateway, it costs $25 per month and a fee of $0.10 per transaction and a daily batch fee of $0.10.Authorize.net is an option for SaaS companies who want to use their own merchant account or internal systems, and just need a payment gateway.Authorize.net reviewsAccepting payments and managing recurring subscriptions is important for any SaaS business (otherwise you won’t get paid). So it’s worth spending a little time to weigh out your options.For most companies, Stripe and Braintree will cover most of what you need. But options like Recurly and Chargebee will give you some additional features SaaS businesses need.At Baremetrics, we use a combination of Stripe and our own product for analytics.

      "Tiered Pricing Model Explained (In Plain English).\n",
      "Luckily, with tiered pricing, you can do both and then some.Rather than pigeonhole yourself into being a “discount” or “premium” service-provider, you can offer plans that appeal to a variety of budgets. For example, you might offer a range of plans tailored toward:See how that works?\n",
      "Usage-Based Pricing: What SaaS Companies Need to Know.\n",
      "Does “you get what you pay for” actually apply to SaaS companies?Depends on who you ask.While the concept is simple enough, many products and services leave us wanting more. That said, upgrading to a “bigger” plan shouldn’t feel like highway robbery.And on the flip side, your customers shouldn’t feel forced to pay month-to-month for services they’re not actually using on a regular basis.Enter usage-based pricing.Charging your customers per-use not only makes your product more affordable and accessible, but also empowers users to only take advantage of the features they need. Nothing more, nothing less.In this guide, we’ll take a deep dive into usage-based pricing, how it works and who it’s for.Let’s kick things off with a quick definition.Usage-based pricing is a SaaS pricing model where cost is based on consumption, charging customers on a “per-use” basis. For example, users might be charged based on the number of subscribers reached or API calls requested.With usage-based billing, users are charged at the end of a billing cycle (typically monthly) based on how much they’ve used your product.Perhaps the most basic way to conceptualize usage-based billing is as a “pay as you go” plan (think: old-school phone plans prior to unlimited data, minutes and texting). If you have a month where you use a product less, you spend less. The converse is also true. For example, Twilio’s SMS service scales up (in their own words) “whether you need 1 or 100,000 numbers.” Beyond customization, this structure highlights how usage-based pricing can help users plan and price out exactly what they need prior to payment.There are also examples of used-based pricing that go beyond traditional “pay as you go” plans. Take Zapier, for instance. Their pricing structure is more akin to traditional tier-based pricing, in which users can customize their plans based on the number of “Zaps” and tasks they need....and if users exceed two million “Zaps,” they’re then charged an additional per-task free. This highlights some of the nuances of usage-based pricing and how it can actually be combined with other pricing models.Usage-based pricing is often presented as a sort of win-win for customers and companies alike. That is, your users enjoy some much-needed flexibility in terms of their budgets while also holding themselves accountable for how much they end up using your product..And although usage-based pricing might not be as straightforward as something like flat-rate billing, consider some of the key advantages below:If you’re on a shoestring budget, shelling out hundreds of dollars per month on a new SaaS product might be out of the question.However, just because a potential customer is on a tight budget now doesn’t mean they’re going to be strapped for cash forever.Usage-based pricing gives your leads the opportunity to test the waters of your product and enjoy a taste at a reduced cost. On a pay-as-you-go model, customers can up their spending as their own companies and budgets grow. The more money your customers save and make, the more they can invest back into their businesses (and ideally, your product is part of the equation).Nobody wants to feel like they’re locked into a long-term contract.Likewise, customers don’t want to feel forced to use a product or service “just because.”Especially during turbulent times, flexibility matters. Giving folks the opportunity to scale down (or scale up) their spending means that they can remain your customers even if their budget changes. And because usage-based pricing doesn’t inherently require users to cancel their plans, customer retention is built into it. In other words, gaps in service and “slow” periods don’t require cancellations. With pay-per-use pricing, you’re less likely to “price out” your prospects.Solo businesses? Startups? Enterprise customers? They’re all fair game.Offering a la carte services allows you to expand your audience to include “power users” and people who might want to use your service every now and then.We’ll bite: although usage-based pricing definitely has its benefits, it’s not without its drawbacks.This is the big one.It’s much harder to keep your revenue stream consistent when product usage and payments fluctuate so much from user to user. Inevitably, you’re going to experience peaks and valleys in terms of how much money you’re bringing in.Although this isn’t a negative per se, it’s something your business needs to be conscious of. For example, a martech solution might experience spikes in usage during the holiday season, which then slows down for the rest of the year.  With per-user pricing, what users essentially “get” as part of their service is usually pretty straightforward.But if someone is totally new to your product, they might not have any idea how many API uses they need. For example, $12/mo per-user is easier to understand versus $0.0010 per-use.Sure, your leads and prospects can probably do a bit of a math to crunch the numbers. That said, you’re inherently putting extra work on your customers which could potentially scare them away.Simply put, customer acquisition is tough. You obviously don’t want to put in the legwork to get someone to your pricing page only to leave them scratching their heads.One way to counteract this is to offer a base price point and charge for additional usage like Geniuslink does. They charge a flat rate of $5, and an additional $2 per 1,000 clicks. Scaling up in smaller increments also makes it a lot less intimidating.There are tons of variables to the SaaS business model and pricing is arguably the most important.And despite popular belief, there is no “right” way to price your product. Even so, some companies benefit more from usage-based pricing than others. Below we’ve highlighted some specific cases.If you offer a service where you’re quite literally encouraging your customers to scale up their audience, revenue and subscribers, usage-based pricing makes perfect sense. Think about email marketing, where list growth and revenue are tied to each other. Tools like ConvertKit offer a sliding scale in which your monthly payments go up as your list grows.This approach to pricing is a sort of subtle way for SaaS and subscription businesses to not only serve as service providers, but also cheerleaders for their customers. Let’s say you offer a one-off service or something that customers more than likely aren’t going to need to use on a regular basis.Take TheChecker, for example. It’s a standalone tool that allows users to verify their email lists. Users can pay for one-off usage based on their list size or purchase bulk credits for later use. Either way, users only get what they pay for.We noted earlier that usage pricing can be confusing, but this approach is crystal clear for customers who only need to know the size of their email list to figure out how much they’ll be paying. This may be a niche case, but it’s a great example of how usage-based can make a tool both valuable and cost-effective in the eyes of the customer.Scalable pricing is a smart move for companies that deal with seasonality. For instance, marketing software where campaigns are seasonal or centered around occasional launches. Another great example of this is Leadfeeder, offering a sort of hybrid billing model which scales up depending on how many leads the tool discovers. This gives users the opportunity to ramp up their spending in conjunction with a campaign and scale back accordingly.By now you probably have a good idea as to whether or not usage-based pricing makes sense for your product.To wrap things up, we’ll cover a couple more considerations if you’re on the fence about a pay-as-you-go model.As highlighted by some of our examples, keep in mind that a sort of hybrid pricing model based around usage is possible. For example, tools like Call Tracker charge a usage fee on top of traditional, per-month pricing.This gives you the best of both worlds, allowing you to build regular recurring revenue that’s more stable than usage-based revenue alone. Of course, this approach requires some serious buy-in from customers who must justify not only a monthly cost but also additional spending on top of it.You can also introduce usage-based pricing as a matter of either-or. For example, tools like Zailab allow users to choose between fixed-rate or consumption-based pricing for their service usage. This requires users to do their homework to figure out the best deal, but again puts the accountability on your customers.Finally, make sure that you keep an eye on what competitors and other players in your space are doing. If none of your neighbors offer usage-based pricing, there’s probably a reason why. Keep tabs on competing pricing models to likewise understand if there are opportunities to experiment with usage-based pricing.Listen: SaaS pricing is complicated. We get it.Whether or not consumption pricing makes sense for you really depends on your product and industry. That said, it’s definitely worth exploring if you offer a scalable or seasonal service.Regardless, consider how tools like Baremetrics can help you monitor your growth no matter which pricing model you offer.We also invite you to check out our Open Startups section to see how real-life companies (like the aforementioned ConvertKit) are scaling up and pricing their services.\n"

      "Revenue Churn: How to Calculate, Track & Improve.\n",
      "Revenue churn answers the question: how much MRR did we lose last month?Your answer says a lot about the long term health of your company as a SaaS or subscription business.The SaaS business model is built on the concept of retaining as much of your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) as possible. Even if you’re bringing in new customers and more MRR each month, it’s hard to achieve long term growth if you can’t get your churn under control.Revenue churn is the percentage of your MRR lost over a specified period of time. To keep things simple, we’ll just assume you’re calculating your revenue churn monthly.It includes revenue lost from customer cancellations, failed charges and downgrades. In other words, any recurring revenue you got last month that didn’t carry over to the next month.You might’ve noticed that the gross revenue churn formula doesn’t account for any new revenue you gained over the month.For instance, you may have lost $5K in MRR to cancellations, but gained $7K MRR from upgrades.If you want to know the difference between what you gained and lost, you’re going to need to calculate your net revenue churn rate.The difference between revenue churn and customer churn rate is pretty simple. Customer churn is the percentage of customers who’ve cancelled in a given period, and revenue churn is the percentage of lost revenue from your existing customers.To put it in even simpler terms:Don’t make the mistake of fixating solely on your customer churn rate. Just because customers aren’t cancelling doesn’t mean you’re not losing money. Downgrades can have a big impact over time if you don’t keep an eye on it.That’s why you need to pay just as much attention to your revenue churn as you do to customer churn.Say you have a revenue churn rate of 3%. Is that good? Bad? Normal? Without some sort of baseline or benchmark, it’s almost impossible to tell. Even if you use your previous numbers as a benchmark, how do you know if it’s good or bad compared to similar companies?While there’s no definitive answer, we (Baremetrics) are trying to help companies get a better idea of how their revenue churn stacks up. You can take a look at our Open Benchmarks page to see how your revenue churn compares to companies that have a similar average revenue per user (ARPU).And if you’re a Baremetrics user (which you totally should be) you can compare your revenue churn to others directly in your dashboard.Net negative revenue churn is when your expansion revenue is greater than the MRR you lost from cancellations and downgrades.For instance, let’s say you started out with $10,000 in MRR at the beginning of the month. You lost $500 in MRR from cancelled customers and downgrades. But you gained $1,000 MRR from your existing customers upgrading their accounts.Let’s plug those numbers into the revenue churn formula:That gives us a net revenue churn rate of -5%. So even though you lost some revenue, you still came out ahead.It’s a huge achievement, but it’s possible (we even did it!)As a SaaS business, the goal is to retain as much of your monthly revenue as possible. It’s essential to your growth. So no matter what your current revenue churn rate is, there’s always room for improvement. Even if you have a negative churn rate, you can still get it lower.Let’s take a look at some tactics you can use to reduce churn.If a lot of your revenue churn comes from customer downgrades, it could be a sign your pricing is off. Luckily, it’s pretty easy to spot.I’ll show you how in Baremetrics.Head to the Revenue Churn dashboard. If you scroll down you can see the revenue churn for each of your different pricing plans.Look for any plans with unusually high revenue churn rates. These are the ones that are losing you the most MRR.To take it a step further, you can use Cancellation Insights to see why people on your high-churn plans are cancelling. Cancellation Insights automatically asks customers why they’re cancelling and collects the feedback for you.If you see a lot of responses like “too expensive” or “switching to a competitor”, don’t assume that means you need to lower your price. It could just be that you’re not providing enough value for the price you’re charging (your value:price ratio).That’s when you should take a look at what your competitors are offering for around the same price point.For instance, Ahrefs, Moz and SEMrush all offer a $99 plan, so people looking for an SEO tool within that budget are likely going to compare the features of all three to see where they get the most value. And you can bet they’re doing the same with your product.Another thing you can do is try to reduce revenue churn by preventing cancellations altogether.In Cancellation Insights, you can create custom emails to send to users who want to cancel, based on their cancellation reason.For example, if a customer chooses “Too expensive” as their cancellation reason, you could send an automated email offering them a discount coupon.It’ll still result in revenue churn, but not as much as you’d lose if they were to cancel completely.Create responses for each of your cancellation reasons, and see if there’s anything you can do to prevent the customer from churning.Here are a couple of resources to help you out:We’ve written about expansion revenue quite a bit at Baremetrics:It’s such an important, yet underutilized SaaS growth strategy that can have an immediate impact on your net revenue churn.Your first priority should be to retain as much revenue as possible. But like we saw in the net negative revenue churn example, expansion can balance out some of the inevitable lost MRR.The main three ways to increase your expansion MRR are:Here’s a graphic to help you visualize each one.Your opportunities for expansion MRR will depend on your business.But typically for SaaS companies, the easiest path is through upgrades. Offer your existing customers more value if they decide to upgrade to a higher priced plan.In order to be successful at it though, the extra value needs to be compelling. A good example of this is Shopify. Their Basic Shopify plan is enough to get your online store off the ground and covers the basics. But when you compare that to the upgraded plans, you can see the additional value you get like additional features and lower fees.That’s an easy sell for Shopify: “Earn more money from your sales by upgrading your account”.Read through my customer expansion guide to learn more about increasing expansion MRR, and to see more examples.If you continue to show your customers how to get value from your product, they’re more likely to stick around. But you need to be proactive, not reactive.What I mean is don’t wait until your customers come to you with questions or complaints about how to use your product. Give them articles, videos and resources that show different product use cases and tips on a regular basis.This is an area we’re starting to focus on more at Baremetrics. But a company that’s already doing a good of it is SpamZilla. It’s a tool that helps you find expired domains to buy. After you sign up, they send you a series of emails that teach you how to use the product and all the things you can do with it.Get it straight! #CanvaTip 📏\n",

      "SaaS Dashboards: Track KPIs & Analytics (With Examples).\n",
      "How’s your business doing today? How has your MRR been trending the past six months? Is churn on the rise?These are the types of questions you can answer in about 1 second with a SaaS dashboard.When you’re trying to grow a SaaS business, having data that’s easily accessible should be a top priority. It’ll help you quickly answer questions from investors or your team. Plus it gives you the information you need to make informed decisions about the future of your business.I’ve gone through the hassle of trying to build dashboards in spreadsheets, or hacking something together with multiple tools. And I have to say, joining Baremetrics and having all our KPIs (key performance indicators) in one place saves me so much time and brain power.Whether you currently don’t have a dashboard at all, or you’re using a tool you’re not 100% satisfied with, this guide is for you.I’m going to give you a step-by-step guide for how to create a custom SaaS dashboard plus share some examples to give you inspiration. Let’s dive in.A SaaS dashboard is like a snapshot into the health of your business. You can think of it like your “medical chart” when you go to the doctor, but for your business. Your dashboard tells you how your business is doing in terms of MRR (monthly recurring revenue), churn, ARPU (average revenue per user) or any other metrics you track to measure growth.Instead of getting numbers from a bunch of different tools or having to deal with complicated spreadsheets that only you understand, your SaaS dashboard serves as the “home” for the metrics that are most important to your business’ growth.Beyond that though, the main reasons I suggest using a SaaS dashboard are:I’ll be honest. I’ve never paid as much attention to the health of the companies I’ve worked for as I have since joining Baremetrics. I think a large part of it is the fact that our data is super easy to access.As we create more content and improve our marketing, I can log into our dashboard and see the impact it’s having on our MRR. It’s extremely motivating.Unfortunately, a lot of SaaS companies fall into one of these buckets:Using a SaaS analytics dashboard that your entire company can access gives everyone the freedom to look into the numbers and learn more about how the business is doing.It also gives everyone context to the decisions you have to make as a founder. Telling your team that you have to cut expenses is a lot easier when you can show them your revenue has been declining for six months straight.If you work in SaaS (particularly for founders) you’re probably addicted to checking your metrics. Sure your MRR isn’t going to drastically change overnight, but you need to know your numbers.For instance, one thing I like to do is see how many customers we added or lost the previous day. If we saw a huge spike or drop, I know something’s off and we can dig into it.Another time this comes in handy is if you work in a team. How many times have you been asked by a manager or someone from another team about a specific metric? Whether it’s MRR, customer churn or anything else, people have questions. Your SaaS dashboard is a quick way to get the answers without fumbling around and having to click through a bunch of windows. It’s great for answering questions from investors as well.Barring some wild event you didn’t see coming (like negative PR), you won’t see drastic changes to your metrics all in one day. Big changes generally happen over time. For instance, your MRR isn’t going to go from $200K to $100K in a day. What typically happens is you slowly lose some MRR over the course of several months, and then one day you wake up and wonder where all your revenue went! That’s an extreme example, but you get the point.Your SaaS dashboard helps you avoid those surprises. When you see big changes in your dashboard, you should immediately dive into them so you can course correct before things get out of control.For example, around February and March of this year, we noticed our MRR growth was slowing down and trending in a negative direction.So we started implementing different growth tactics to get back on track, like focusing on upsells and even experimenting with a new product line. Over time, we were able to get things back on track and started trending in a positive direction.If we didn’t have a dashboard that we tracked on a regular basis, it would’ve been more difficult to see that downwards trend early on, and we would’ve been slower to take action.The faster you can spot negative trends or issues in your business, the less long term damage it’ll cause you.Knowing where you stand today is nice, but unless you’re able to take that data and turn it into a plan to improve your business in the future, what’s the point?A strategic dashboard (meaning customized to your business) can be a great starting point for your growth plan.Like I mentioned in #3, we used the data from our dashboard to prioritize our growth efforts. If you’re a smaller startup with limited resources like us, you need to know where to put your focus.When we saw that our revenue was diving, we shifted our development resources towards our marketing and growth until things were in a better place.Unless you plan to use spreadsheets, you’re going to want a tool that can build your SaaS dashboard for you.Obviously, I’m going to recommend Baremetrics here. But not just because it’s our product. Our dashboards are easy to build, give you tons of customization options and they’re a lot easier on the eyes than Excel and Google spreadsheets (yay data visualization!)It shows you a feed of any activities customers take from new trials, to downgrades, upgrades and everything in between. And you can filter out the stream to see specific activities.As a marketer, I love seeing new trials, converted trials and upgrades. It’s motivating, and a little addictive if I’m being honest.The last thing I’ll mention is that you have the ability to create multiple dashboards.If you have multiple people on your account, everyone can create their own dashboards, and can choose whether or not they want to share with the rest of the team.For instance, marketing might have a dashboard with their most important metrics, the finance team could have their own, etc.If you’re interested in giving Baremetrics a try (we're a full on SaaS analytics tool), you can sign up for a free trial here.Creating a custom SaaS dashboard is super simple. Here’s how to do it in Baremetrics.From your main dashboard hover over the little arrow and click “Create a new dashboard”.You have three types of widgets you can add to your dashboard. The first is Metric, which you see in the screenshot above. These are the widgets you’ll use to track your SaaS KPIs like churn, MRR, and other metrics that change over time.You can choose two different views for your metrics—a graph or a small snapshot with just the number. Here’s what each looks like.You can build a basic SaaS dashboard with just that. But if you want to take things to the next level, you can view metrics by customer segments.For instance, let’s say I just wanted to see MRR from our customers that use Stripe as a payment processor, I’d just choose that segment from the dropdown.Check out this article to learn more about how segmentation works in Baremetrics. But the short of it is you can create segments based on a ton of attributes like country, plans, UTM tags and dozens more. Plus you can pull in data from other sources like Intercom, your CRM or marketing automation tool for even more attributes.You can probably already imagine how this can be useful, but here’s one example. Let’s say your company serves customers in three main countries. You could create separate dashboards for each country. Or if you have three plan levels, you can create dashboards to see your metrics for each plan.The second type of widget you can add is a Goal.The Goal widget is pretty straightforward. It shows you how you’re pacing towards specific goals you’ve set in Baremetrics. A good way to use this is if you create a year-specific dashboard. For instance, if we create a 2020 Dashboard, we might include goals specific to this year.Here’s how the widget looks on a dashboard.Want some ideas for your own SaaS dashboard? Here are some examples I put together in Baremetrics.Depending on what your marketing role is, you’re probably interested in metrics like your free trial conversion rate, churn, and new customers. This example highlights customer acquisition, trial performance and churn.Our default control panel we set up when you first connect your data is a great overview for most founders. But in addition to that, you can also create a custom dashboard with the metrics most important to you.For this example, we highlighted some top level goals so you can quickly see how you’re pacing, and graphs to visualize how you’re trending towards your goals.If you work in finance, chances are you’re primarily concerned with… finances!While you won't get a complete financial report from Baremetrics, you can get plenty of data on revenue.Again, these are all just examples. You can add a ton of other metrics, and create dashboards for your customer success team, engineering and anyone else in your company.As you probably know, we’re big fans of transparency at Baremetrics. And while you don’t need to go as far as us and share your metrics with the world, you should at least share them with your team. Baremetrics makes that super simple to do.A SaaS dashboard is one of the most important tools you can use to measure and plan your growth (and get a full picture of how you're performing).You can’t improve what you don’t measure, and organizing your metrics in one place is the best way to get started.If you’re interested in creating a custom SaaS dashboard and getting actionable insights for your business, grab a free trial of Baremetrics and setup your first dashboard in one-click!\n"

      "Dunning Management: How to Recover Failed Payments.\n",
      "Failed payments are part of running a subscription or SaaS business. It’s normal for credit card payments to get declined. But unless you have dunning management in place, chances are those failed payments are costing you a lot of money.In this guide, I’m going to break down what dunning management is, how it works, how to completely automate the dunning process and some best practices to follow in order to recover more revenue from failed payments.In short, dunning is recovering failed payments from customers. Dunning management is the process in which you do it.When you have a recurring billing/subscription business model, failed payments are inevitable. At some point, you’re going to attempt to charge one of your customers and the payment isn’t going to go through. Usually as a result of:When payments fail, you have two options:If you don’t have a dunning management solution in place, chances are you’re using option #1.Unless you’re ok with losing monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and customers, you’re much better off going with option #2 and setting up a process to contact customers after a failed transaction and collect the payment.You’re probably already starting to understand why dunning management isn’t just a “nice to have”, and really a necessity for any company that collects recurring payments (i.e. a SaaS or subscription service).But just in case you need a little more convincing, or you just want to know exactly what’s at stake, here are some of the main ways dunning management will help you grow.This should be enough of a reason alone to use dunning management.Based on our data, on average, SaaS companies lose about 9% of their MRR due to failed payments and involuntary churn.Involuntary churn is when a customer’s subscription ends unintentionally. It’s usually as a result of a failed payment that never got fixed.Some companies make the assumption that customers know when their payments fail and just wait for them to update their payment information. But what we’ve found is that’s not always the case.You’ve probably even experienced it first-hand when your credit card expires and you completely forget to update your own subscriptions with the new billing details. It’s an easy mistake to make.And unless the customer is logging into your product frequently, there’s a chance they could go an entire month without noticing unless you tell them.That’s why implementing dunning management is a quick and easy win for business growth. It’s simple to set up and pretty much runs itself. I’ll show you how later on.Depending on the type of business you run, this could be a very important reason to have a dunning management solution in place.Let’s say you own a SaaS company that monitors website downtime. Your customers depend on your software to let them know when their website has issues, so every minute that their service is interrupted means potential lost revenue for them.What happens when their monthly payment fails and goes unpaid for weeks? Unless you keep the service going for delinquent customers (which is probably a good idea), it can create unnecessary service disruptions.Which brings me to my next point...Yes, dunning management helps you make (and keep) more revenue. But it also helps your customer.Unlike voluntary churn, most of the time customers who have failed payments don’t want to cancel their service. So just as much as dunning helps you, it also gives your customers a layer of protection to make sure they don’t experience any type of disruption with their account.Now that you know the what and why, let’s talk about how dunning management actually works. The involuntary churn graphic I showed earlier is an example of what a lot of companies without a dunning management process do—and results in involuntary churn. But here’s what a more effective dunning process looks like:This is the event that triggers the entire process. Whether their credit card is expired, they have insufficient funds or any other reason, a customer’s payment failed and the charge didn’t go through.Customer communication is key here.The day that your customer’s payment fails, send them an email to let them know there was a payment failure, with a link to update their billing information.Your billing software might have automated payment retries that will try charging the card again again at this point.If there was a soft declined payment, that might work. But if not, move on to step 3.The customer will either log in and update their billing information, or wait/not see your email. If they update their billing information, great! You’ll recover the payment and all is right in the world.If they don’t make a payment, move to step four.Emails get missed and people get busy. It’s life. However, that means that there’s a chance your first dunning email will get passed up. And unfortunately, that’s where a lot of subscription companies stop the dunning process.But not you, because you read this article!You need to send a follow-up dunning email (just a gentle reminder) to be proactive about collecting failed payments. However, you don’t have to send it the very next day. For instance, at Baremetrics we wait until a few days after the first email to send our follow-up.You can continue to send a few more dunning emails until the customer updates their billing information. But we suggest spacing them out. For instance, we send a total of six emails over 30 days.At this point, you should also set up a reminder notification in-app or paywall to update their billing information.If you offer a grace period for customers to make an overdue payment, you can mention that in your email as well.If after all of your attempts, the customer still doesn’t update their billing information, you’ll likely have a churned customer on your hands.Between the email notification, in-app reminders and a paywall when they login, most customers will fix the payment issue if they can. But if not, sometimes you’ll have to accept a bump in your churn rate.If this all sounds like a lot, don’t worry. It can all be automated!Unless you plan to manually send emails to each customer when their payment fails, you’re going to need some type of dunning management software to automate the process.And while most dunning management tools have some similar functionality, they’re not all equal. Here’s a look at some of the best dunning management software to recover failed payments.We couldn’t make a list of the best dunning management software and not include our own product!Recover does everything you need from dunning software from sending emails, to making it easy for customers to make payments, in-app payment reminders and provides you with dunning analytics so you can see exactly how much revenue you’ve saved.But aside from the fact that we developed it, there are plenty of reasons to go with Recover. For one, it’s integrated with the rest of our metrics, so you can get deeper insights than other dunning tools.For example, you can see your complete customer’s profile including what plan they’re on, and a timeline of any failed charges, dunning emails sent, and more all in one place.Some subscription companies prefer to use out-the-box dunning software from their subscription billing software. However, we find that a lot of times, these tools are more limited than what you’d get from a standalone dunning tool like Recover. Most dunning tools from payment processors/subscription billing providers:But in case you’re interested, here are some other dunning software options:Just getting some type of dunning management up and running will likely get you some results. Almost anything is better than doing nothing.But if you want to maximize the amount of MRR you recover each month from failed payments, here are some best practices to keep in mind.I can’t stress this enough! Use dunning management software to automate this entire process. It’s so simple and it can save you thousands of dollars in revenue churn.Even if you’re thinking to yourself, “I only have 100 customers, is it worth paying for?” The answer is yes!All the time you spend manually sending emails and tracking down customers who haven’t paid is time you could be spending elsewhere on things you can’t automate.Seriously, do it.Dunning emails are very effective for recovering failed payments. But you can double down by including in-app reminders for customers to update their billing information. Like I mentioned earlier, you can set this up in Recover so that when customers login to your software, they’ll see a pop-up asking them to update their billing information.If customers ignore this message, it means they either:Generally speaking, the easier it is to do something, the more likely people are to do it. That applies to most things in life, including updating billing information.It really shouldn’t take more than two clicks for customers to be able to update their billing information. For instance, if you send an email, they should be able to click the link and be taken directly to a credit card form.If it’s an in-app reminder, they should be able to update their information directly in the form that pops up.A while back, I reached out to over 30 different SaaS and subscription companies and asked them to share the dunning emails they send to customers.You can take a look at the all here: How to Write Effective Dunning Emails (30+ Examples Included)It’s a great resource if you’re setting up a dunning management process for the first time, or if you’re just looking to refresh your current emails.I know I sound like a broken record by now, but every SaaS and subscription company should have a dunning solution.I’m speaking from experience. Using Recover has helped us recover over $30,000 in potential lost revenue in just the past nine months.And if you’re currently not doing anything about dunning, there’s a strong chance you don’t even know how much revenue you’re losing each year from failed payments. Whether you go with Recover or another tool, setting up dunning management needs to be on your to-do list ASAP.\n"

      "Per User Pricing: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.\n",
      "Pricing is one of the most heavily debated topics in the SaaS world.Not just how much to charge, but what pricing model to go with. Do you charge per user? A flat rate? Some kind of oddly complex credit system?In the early days of selling software (and transitioning into SaaS), per user pricing was pretty standard.But over time, companies started to realize that charging per user doesn’t always make sense for SaaS, and it could even limit your growth. Some people even look at per user pricing as one of the worst pricing models you can use.On the other hand, there are plenty of companies happily charging for every user a customer adds to their account, and they’re raking in millions in MRR.So, is per user pricing really as bad as some think? Or is it a missed opportunity for growth? Read on to find out.Just like the name suggests, per user pricing is when you charge a customer based on the number of users (or seats) they add to their subscription.For instance, you might charge $10 per user per month. The more users the customer adds, the more they pay.Despite the negative reputation per user pricing gets, there are plenty of companies that use it.Slack (we’ll talk more about them later) has two plans: Standard and Plus. Each has its own price per user.Notice the fine print. They cap the number of users you can have in the lowest priced plan to 10 users. After that, you’ll have to upgrade to the next tier up.Lastly, let’s look at Asana. Similar to Salesforce, they offer multiple plans, each with a different price per user.At first glance, per user pricing might sound really tempting. The more users your customer adds to their account, the more money you get. Yay, expansion revenue!Except it’s not that clear cut. There are some important things to keep in mind before you go with per user pricing that might make you reconsider.Going back to the Asana example, let’s say you’re a small business that’s been using the free version of Asana for about a year. You’ve gotten up to 14 users on your team, and now you want to add three more, putting you at a total of 17.That would put you over the 15 user limit for a free account. Now, you go from paying zero to $229 per month, or a lump sum of $2241.96 if you make an annual payment (and that’s assuming you don’t add any more users to your account).For Asana, that’s great. But for the customer, it can be a little frustrating. Even if you make it known that the price increase is going to happen (like Asana does), the price shock is still there.Even if your customers aren’t going from a free account to a paid account, price shock can still happen with per user pricing. Let’s take a look at Salesforce again.Their Essentials plan starts at $25 per month. But once you get up to 10 users, you’ll have to upgrade to the next level up, which is their Professional plan. And that’s $50 more per user per month. So let’s say you go from 10 users to 12, the price you pay per month more than triples:This can understandably create some friction for customers. Luckily there are ways to combat this, which I’ll go into later.One of the most popular arguments against per user pricing is that “number of users” isn’t a value metric for most companies.A value metric is the metric your product’s pricing is based on. Take our dunning management tool (Recover) for instance. Our value metric for it is MRR.The amount you pay for Recover is based on your MRR, because the more revenue you have, the more potential revenue you’re losing from failed payments.As our customers’ revenue increases, so does our expansion MRR, which leads to growth.Now imagine if we were to use per user pricing for Recover instead. It wouldn’t make sense. Even if we were to charge $100 per user for Recover, our growth potential would be cut dramatically because there’s not a ton of value in people adding more users. They could all just share the same password.Whether a customer has 1 or 20 users, they don’t necessarily get more value from just having those additional users.With per user user pricing, your growth becomes dependent on the number of seats you can sell. And at that point, it’s almost like retail, which eliminates a lot of the benefits of the SaaS business model.In order to work, per user pricing almost always needs to be combined with another SaaS pricing model.In all of the examples we’ve shown so far, the companies aren’t relying on just per user pricing. Slack and Asana come the closest, but they both also have multiple plans with added features.Salesforce has different plan levels as well as add-on products and services. Like most things in life, there are exceptions. For instance, SEO Powersuite strictly charges per license.But they’re an outlier. When you look at their competitors, very few if any only use per user pricing.I know, so far it probably sounds like we’re completely against the idea of per user pricing. But there are some instances when this pricing model does make sense.Per user pricing isn’t all bad for SaaS companies. Here are some situations where it makes sense.If you sell a product that does get added value from having multiple users, per user pricing can make a lot of sense. This is typically the case for team-based SaaS products.Slack is one of the best examples of this. Nobody’s using Slack alone, and it’d be weird if you were.However, Slack doesn’t just charge per user. They charge per active user. What that means is you only pay for users that are actively using Slack. Here’s how they define active and inactive users:This is the best-case scenario for companies that charge per user. The problem is that Slack isn’t the norm. In most cases, SaaS companies charge for all the users added to a customer’s account, regardless if they login or use the product at all.Project management software is another example of when per-user pricing makes sense. Asana, Trello and Monday all have some form of per user pricing.Since people collaborate on projects together in these tools, they can justify charging per user.CRM is another example. With CRM software, multiple people add contacts, collaborate on deals and manage customer relationships.Tools like Pipedrive, Insightly and Streak all have per user pricing for teams.If you look at most of the companies that use per user pricing, you’ll notice a lot of them are targeting enterprise or mid-market customers.It’s not a coincidence.One survey from KeyBanc found that 33% of SaaS companies chose “number of seats” (or users) as their primary pricing metric.That number shocked me a bit, so I wanted to see what type of businesses were surveyed.And when I looked further, I could see that most of the businesses surveyed were enterprise/mid-market focused.If you’re looking for a way to price your SaaS product without only charging per user, there are plenty of other options out there. We even wrote an entire guide about it: SaaS Pricing Models & Strategies Demystified.That article dives deep into seven different SaaS pricing models, so I highly recommend checking it out.For now, I’ll go over three options that can get you similar results as per user pricing, but without some of the downsides.One of the appeals of per user pricing is that it allows your revenue per user to grow over time. But it requires your customers to add more seats in order to do it. A good alternative is usage-based pricing.That’s when you price your product based on how much customers use it. For example, EmailOctopus charges based on the number of email subscribers you have.This pricing model works better for some businesses than others. But if you have a way to price your product based on usage, it’s well worth a try. Start by defining your value metric. Your value metric should be based on where your customers get the most value from your product. For EmailOctopus, that was the number of emails sent, and for Stripe it’s the number of transactions that can be processed.There’s a good chance you already know what your value metric is. But if not, you can look at product usage data or even survey your customers.A good litmus test for whether or not you chose the right value metric is how simple it is to understand on a pricing page. For instance, on our pricing page, it’s super clear that our pricing is based on your MRR.But if you look at the pricing for Keap, it’s not quite as clear what the value metric is.Once you’ve defined your value metric, figure out how you can build your pricing around it. It could be a sliding scale like ours, per action like Stripe or buckets like EmailOctopus. It all depends on your business.If you’re set on charging per user, you’ll probably have happier customers if you go the Slack route and only charge for active users.You can use a tool like Servicebot to set up per active user pricing if you use Stripe.This pricing strategy is helpful if you sell a product that’s meant to be used by entire companies or departments. For instance, employee advocacy software like Bambu or Sociabble are usually priced based on the number of total users. But a lot of times, all the users who were added to the account don’t end up using it long term. So the customer ends up paying for non-active users.Sure, you’ll earn more money if you charge for all users (at least in the short term). But from my experience, companies don’t tend to pay unused software for very long, particularly if the price feels high.If you want to keep customers long term (which you should if you work in SaaS), you might want to consider pricing your product in a way that encourages customers to stick around.This is a happy medium between charging per user and value-based pricing. Instead of focusing your entire pricing model around the number of users, you choose a value metric that makes more sense, and then offer additional users as an add-on.This pricing strategy makes a lot more sense for most SaaS companies, particularly if your product isn’t strictly team-based.A good example of this is Ahrefs, who recently added an option to pay for for additional users.Their value metrics are all related to SEO analysis, so basing their entire pricing strategy on the number of users doesn’t make sense.At the same time, having an entire team share one password and account can be an issue for some companies, so they have the ability to add additional users as an add-on. That creates an opportunity for expansion revenue for Ahrefs.This approach makes sense when:The value customers get from your product doesn’t depend on how many users they have on their account, AND There is some value to having extra users to a customer’s subscriptionIf the only reason you’re charging for additional users is so you can make more money, then you might want to rethink it.There you have it. The good, the bad and ugly side of per user pricing.Per user pricing isn’t quite as bad as some people make it out to be. But for most SaaS companies, there are better pricing models out there, and more effective alternatives like the ones I mentioned.So the answer to the million dollar question: “is per user pricing right for you?”… it depends.\n"

      "How to Use Customer Expansion to Skyrocket Growth (+ examples).\n",
      "Think about the time, energy and resources you put towards acquiring new customers.Now, how much time, energy and resources do you put towards increasing the revenue you get from your existing customers, a.k.a customer expansion?If you’re like a lot of SaaS companies, chances are you’re fixated on customer acquisition. Most of your marketing dollars are probably spent on ads and content to get more people to sign up for your product. And you have salespeople dedicated to chasing down new leads.As someone who’s spent most of my SaaS career focused on getting new customers, I get it. But as I’ve seen throughout my time at Baremetrics, customer expansion is an extremely underrated growth strategy that SaaS companies take for granted.As I dug more into our own data, and spoke to other SaaS companies, I started to learn more about the best ways to grow a business through customer expansion. And as always, I’m sharing everything I’ve learned with you.In most cases, customer expansion falls under one of three buckets for SaaS companies:Here’s a visual of the difference between the three, explained with ice cream!Later offers four different plans. On the Starter plan, users can post up to 60 posts on each of their social profiles. But if they want to post, say, 100 to each profile, they’d need to switch to a higher level plan. That’s an example of customer expansion through upgrading.At Baremetrics, our flagship product is our metrics. Detailed reporting and analytics on everything from revenue, churn, customers and more. But we also have a couple of other products as well, Cancellation Insights and Recover.Each of these products enhance the value you get from our metrics, but you don’t necessarily need them to use Baremetrics. That’s an example of customer expansion through cross-selling.Ahrefs offers plans based on one user (for their two lowest priced plans). If you want to add an additional user to your plan, there’s an additional cost. That’s an example of customer expansion through add-ons.Customer expansion is hands down one of the best ways to grow a SaaS company without falling victim to the “acquire new customers at all costs” mindset.Which brings me to my next point.Getting new customers isn’t a bad thing. You’re running a business after all, so getting more people to pay you money is always the goal.The problem however, comes when you think that getting new customers is the only way to grow your business. Not only is that not true, but in some cases, getting new customers isn’t even the best growth strategy.We’ve all heard that it costs more to acquire new customers than to sell to existing ones. But that’s amplified even more when it comes to SaaS. Here’s a quick look at the average customer acquisition cost (CAC) by industry according to data from Propeller.The software industry is at the top of the list.But the cost of selling to your existing customers? It can be as low as zero, depending on how you do it, which we’ll talk about in the next section.Beyond the cost, there’s also a lot more effort involved to acquire new customers. Here’s a simplified comparison of the amount of work you’d need to acquire a new customer, vs getting an existing customer to upgrade.In case you need any more convincing, we’ve personally experienced a ton of growth over the past 12 months thanks to our customer expansion efforts. In fact, there are plenty of months where our expansion MRR outperformed our MRR from new customers.We went over the different types of customer expansion. But how do you put them to use? Just having an option to upgrade, or listing your add-on products on your website isn’t enough. You need to be proactive about increasing your expansion MRR. Here’s how:Let’s start with what’s probably the most common paths towards customer expansion. Your pricing.Value or usage-based pricing is when you charge based on usage, rather than having 3-4 flat rate pricing plans based on features. “Usage” can be defined by any number of things. For instance, Stripe’s pricing is based on a percentage of the charges they process.You see this pricing model used a lot by email marketing companies. They’ll generally price based on the number of email subscribers you have or the number of emails you send per month.A great example of this is EmailOctopus. Their pricing is based on the number of email subscribers you have.According to their Marketing Manager, Hollie Youlden, customer expansions accounted for 47% of new revenue and 9.48% of their MRR last month!Since their pricing is usage based, the expansion happens almost automatically.With this strategy, they’ve been able to convert over 70% of customers to their additional seat prices over the past 12 months.One of the reasons I love this customer expansion approach is because it requires your product to deliver. Going back to EmailOctopus, if their product wasn’t helping their customers to grow their email marketing efforts, their lists wouldn’t grow and therefore EmailOctopus wouldn’t get as much expansion MRR.And in order to help customers grow, they also give them tips, templates and other resources to educate them on how to improve their email marketing.We take a similar approach at Baremetrics. In order for us to increase our expansion MRR, our customers need to grow. So we’ve started to focus our efforts on creating content that shows SaaS companies how to grow their business (like this blog post!).This strategy might not work for every business. But it’s a convenient way to somewhat automate your customer expansion.If you have multiple pricing plans or addons and upsells, email is going to be your best friend for customer expansion.A lot of times, the only time SaaS companies send “sales” emails is when they’re cold emailing a new lead, or trying to convert free users to a paid plan. But who says you can’t sell to your existing customers over email too?Let’s dig into what makes these emails effective, and how you can use email for your own customer expansion.First, both of these emails were specifically sent to customers, as noted by the “Sent from” address in Sprout’s email.If they were to send these emails to people who don’t currently use their product, the emails would:But since I’m already a customer of each, they have a bit more flexibility in the copy.Next, let’s take a look at the subject lines they used. Sprout’s was very effective at getting me to open it up:The reason this email is enticing, is because Sprout regularly sends out reports to customers. So your first thought when you see the subject line is that they’ve created some type of new report for you.Here’s Buffer’s subject line.They ask a question. As we’ve mentioned in some of our other posts about SaaS emails, questions are a great way to boost your open rate.Plus, the answer to the question immediately qualifies the recipient. If they do use boosted posts, they’re likely to click on it. And even if you don’t use boosted posts, you might click on it just out of curiosity like I did.In the body of each email, they get into specifics, without getting too in-depth. And if you’re interested, you click through to landing pages of each product.This is actually a missed opportunity by both companies in my opinion. Instead of pointing to a generic landing page, they could’ve directed you to a page that shows your current plan + what you’d get by trying the new products.That’s exactly what WhatConverts does. When customers contact their support team to ask about features that are only available on their premium plan, they send them a quick one-sheeter that outlines the value they’d get by upgrading.A good time to prompt customers to upgrade or upsell them is when they’re already signed in and using your product.If you offer multiple plans, and the higher tier plans have additional features, make those features visible for users in lower tier plans—but lock them. For instance, in ConvertKit, you can get Deliverability reports with their Creator Pro plan. Instead of completely hiding that feature for customers on lower plans, they make it visible and prompt you to upgrade in order to access the data.If you’re going to push up-sells within your product, just be careful not to make them annoying and disruptive. They shouldn’t take away from your user’s experience.It’s something we were cognizant of when we implemented our own in-product upsells. Here’s an example of how we up-sell our add-on products in our dashboards. And we’ve gotten some good feedback on our approach!The more contextual and relevant you can make your in-product upsells, the better. Soapbox is another company that prompts users to update their plan in-app, and according to their CEO, Brennan McEachran, it plays a big role in their customer expansion.This, combined with some of their other customer expansion revenue, keeps their expansion revenue at the same level or higher than new MRR each month. In fact, last month their expansion MRR was 1.3 times more than their new MRR, which is just more proof of the power of customer expansion.Whether you go the route we went with the minimal notifications, Ahrefs with a banner, or locking upgraded features like ConvertKit, in-product upsells are a great way to boost your customer expansion revenue.This is probably the most ambitious way to boost your expansion MRR, but it can also yield the biggest results.Create new add-on features or even an additional product that you can cross-sell to your existing customers. Since there’s a ton of resources involved in order to pull off, you’re going to want to do plenty of research and be certain it’ll be worth it.The brightside is it’s usually a little easier than creating your initial product since you already have a customer base to sell too.Take this example from Nathan from Funnel Fix It for instance.They started off with their initial service, and had success for years. However, a huge chunk of their clients were agencies, and Nathan noticed a lot of them struggled with billing and onboarding their own clients. And the ones who did have a solution were paying thousands of dollars for it.So Nathan and his team built their own billing and onboarding platform tailored towards agencies, that would cost a fraction of what their clients were already paying elsewhere. When they were ready to launch, they reached out to a small group of their existing customers who they knew could benefit from the platform. That allowed them to do a “soft launch” and work out the kinks before offering it to the rest of their customers.Since launching the new tool, they’ve seen a 30% increase in their LTV, and their MRR has been trending in the right direction.We also have first-hand experience with this tactic after launching Recover and Cancellation Insights. We offer both products as up-sells, and standalone tools.And these two products have generated over $20K in MRR for us.If you want to try this out yourself, here are some tips:With the land and expand strategy, you “land” customers in with a lower-cost introductory product, like a free trial or basic plan. Then over time as you build a relationship with them and help them grow, you’re able to “expand” the relationship through upgradesThis has been one of Kinsta’s main strategies for customer expansion, and their Chief Business Officer Tom Zsomborgi, shared how they’ve used it to grow.Email Meter uses a version of land and expand as well. Their Basic plan offers enough value to land initial users.Then, as users have a chance to the product, they start adding additional users, want more advanced features or even need custom work.According to Email Meter's CEO, Marianella Mace, their most effective customer expansion strategy is building relationships with users through their Customer Success team. Every customer that comes to you with a question is an opportunity to strengthen your relationship with them and show them other ways your product can create value for them. With this strategy, a little over 50% of Email Meter's MRR comes from customer expansion.Land and expand works particularly well for SaaS companies that offer “scalable” pricing. You want to offer a price level that’s low enough to bring in the entry level users, but also has room to scale up.Using Kinsta as an example, their lowest priced plan is $30. That’s low enough to get entry level people in the door. And then as their needs change, they can expand to one of the higher priced plans.But let’s say if instead, their lowest priced plan was $100. The people who would’ve been willing to try the service at $30 (and would’ve eventually built up to the $100 plan) are automatically excluded and Kinsta would lose out on potential customers.WP Buffs is another company that takes the land and expand approach. They offer WordPress website management for individual website owners, as well as agencies. The majority of their expansion MRR comes from their agency clients. Here’s how it works.Agencies use WP Buffs to manage their own client’s websites through a white label service. When one of their agency partners gets a new client, they add them to their white label account at WP Buffs, which = expansion MRR.As a result, WP Buffs doubled down on their agency program by creating a ton of marketing resources their agency partners can use to get more clients.Again, the takeaway here is with the land and expand strategy, the more effort you put towards making your customers successful, the more expansion revenue you’ll see.As soon as you “land” a customer, start building and nurturing a relationship with them. Eventually, you’ll be able to expand that relationship into more MRR.Instead of spending all your time thinking of ways to get new customers, think of how you can provide more value to your current ones.Not only can customer expansion increase your MRR, but it also increases your customer lifetime value and reduces churn.

      "How To Calculate & Improve Your Customer Retention Rate.\n",
      "Would you continue to pay for something every month that you don’t use?For most people, including your customers, the answer is no. Unless you’re talking about a gym membership of course.That’s why improving your customer retention rate needs to be a top priority for every SaaS business. The success of your company literally depends on your ability to keep customers paying you for as long as possible.The sad part is a lot of the reasons customers cancel are actually avoidable. In fact, one survey found that companies in the U.S. lose $136 billion every year to avoidable customer switching.It’s pretty widely accepted that it’s more expensive to acquire new customers than retain existing ones. Yet for some reason, the SaaS industry seems to be a lot more focused on customer acquisition than retention, despite the fact that SaaS companies need to keep customers long term in order to grow.Focusing primarily on acquisition makes sense in the early days, when you’re just starting to get off the ground. But as your business grows and you start to get new customers (and build a solid funnel to bring more in), you should really shift your focus towards retention.No matter how many new customers you bring in each month, if you’re unable to keep them around long term, it’s extremely difficult to grow a SaaS business.You’ll find yourself in a never ending cycle of trying to acquire new customers each month to replace the ones that are churning. It's like spending more money than you make each month and trying to get out of debt.Coming from a customer acquisition background, I learned a lot about how impactful retention and upsells can be for SaaS companies once I joined Baremetrics.Unlike other companies I’ve worked with, a huge part of our growth strategy here is focused on retention and expansion (increasing revenue through upsells). In fact, you can see just how much of our revenue comes from existing customers versus new ones here.Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that you should only focus on your existing customers.But if you’re dedicating a large portion of your time and resources (like over 90%) solely on getting new customers, you might want to reconsider the mix. Especially if retention and churn have been an issue for you.First, decide what period of time you want to see your retention rate for. Typically it’ll be monthly or annually.Then, you’ll need a few numbers:Then, you’ll just put those three numbers into the customer retention rate formula:Here’s an example. Let’s say our numbers looked like this:If we put that into our formula, we get:((110 - 20) / 100) * 100 = 90% retention rateIf you’re wondering where to get the initial numbers (B,E,N) you should be able to get them through your payment provider.You can also find them in Baremetrics. You can grab the \"B\" and \"E\" under Active Customers.Ideally, you want to keep your retention rate above 90%. If yours is under that, or you just want to get it as high as possible, let’s talk about what you can do to improve your numbers.In order to retain more customers, you need to find out why they're leaving in the first place. That means it’s time for a little churn analysis.Churn analysis is using data to understand why customers churn. We wrote an entire guide on how to analyze churn, which you can read here.But here’s a quick summary.Start by sending a cancellation survey to customers when they unsubscribe from your product.Make it short and easy to fill out, not a 10 minute questionnaire. You just need to ask them why they’re cancelling. You can learn more about how to create an effective cancellation survey here.Here’s an example of ours:I highly suggest using our Cancellation Insights (CI) tool for this. After filling out the survey, we collect the data and organize it in easy-to-read reports and dashboards like this:This way, you can get an instant look at the top reasons people are cancelling, and how much revenue you’re losing from each cancellation reason.Once you’ve identified the top cancellation reasons, you know exactly what’s hurting your retention rate. It could be pricing, a lack of a certain feature, poor support or anything else.As you’re planning out your growth and retention strategy, take into account the reasons people are cancelling and prioritize the ones that are causing the most lost revenue.If you want to do some deep analysis, I recommend reading through the entire churn analysis guide. I dove into some very specific and more advanced strategies to analyze churn.Taking the previous tip one step further, you can add in a little cohort analysis. In Baremetrics, we show you your customer retention rate broken down by cohorts (based on when customers signed up). It looks like this.The percentages are the retention rates of each cohort month-to-month. For example, 79% of the 24 customers that signed up in April remained two months after signing up.You can do some pretty nifty things with this little table. I wrote about it all in our cohort analysis guide, which you can read here.But the short of it is you can use it to spot trends, and zero in on what makes certain people churn over others.For instance, if you notice your retention rate in months 0-3 are on the low end, there could be an issue with your onboarding process, or you’re acquiring the wrong type of customers.You can dive into their cancellation reasons (using tip #1) to learn exactly why these customers are cancelling so early on in their subscription.If you want to see a step-by-step guide of how to do this, you can read my full guide here: How to Use Cohort Analysis to Reduce Churn & Improve RetentionYou don’t need to wait until customers churn to find out where your product falls short. When's the last time you asked your current customers what you could improve on?The easiest way to do this is by sending out a quick survey to your customers, like we did earlier this year (we used Typeform).If you send a survey, just be prepared to handle all the comments without being defensive or dismissive.Some of the feedback will be hard to hear (it’s almost like someone calling your baby ugly), but if you really take in the responses, it’ll help you retain more customers in the future.Another way to get feedback is to monitor what people are saying about your brand on social media. People on Twitter seem to be particularly upfront about how they feel.Gathering the feedback is step one. But unless you do something with the info, it’s not going to help your retention. Based on the feedback you get, start to plan out the most important changes you need to make into your product roadmap.As you start to roll out the updates, keep an eye on your retention rate to see what type of impact it makes.If you want to get really detailed, you can use our retention cohort table to see how the retention rate of customers that signed up during the months of your changes compare to previous ones.If you want to retain customers, make it so they can’t function without your product.Easier said than done, I know. But it’s possible. In fact, you probably use a ton of apps and software right now that you couldn’t function without. For instance, as a content marketer, one of the things I do on a daily basis is see what websites have linked to our site to find opportunities to partner up on content or just to send a quick email to say thanks.Buzzsumo sends me a daily report of our backlinks from the day before, so it’s become a part of my regular workflow in the morning.If I were to cancel my Buzzsumo account, it’d interrupt my daily schedule.The ability to do something similar depends largely on your product, but there are plenty of examples to draw inspiration from.The simplest way is to send notifications or alerts with some type of actionable/useful information like the Buzzsumo example. Over time, you’re training people to expect emails from you, to the point that it becomes a part of their day-to-day function. Here are some other examples.Copper sends emails to customers suggesting new contacts to add based on people they’ve emailed and received emails from.ContentKing is an app that monitors your website for content changes and SEO issues. When something goes wrong or they see a change in your website, they send email alerts.ContentKing is also a good example of how you can build the “necessity” factor directly into your product. Imagine using ContentKing for months, and getting all those notifications when something goes wrong on your website. You’re likely not going to cancel unless you’ve found a replacement tool. That automatically improves their chances of retaining customers, because the alternative is to leave your site unmonitored, which most companies won't want to do.Another company that does a good job of this is Geniuslink. One of the key features of Geniuslink is the ability to create affiliate links that are easier to track. Geniuslink gives you a special URL that looks something like this: geni.us/lettersandnumbers. You take those URLs and put them into articles on your website, share them on social media and elsewhere. Once you’ve added a bunch of these links into your website, the chances of you wanting to go back and swap them all out are very slim.So the inconvenience of changing can be a motivator to retain users. Obviously, this isn't something that should be abused. You don’t want people to keep using your product just because it’s a pain to stop using. But if you make a product that customers can't function without, it makes retaining them a lot easier.You’ve probably heard the phrase “innovate or die” before. While it might sound a bit extreme, it’s a harsh reality for SaaS businesses (really all businesses).No matter what type of software you sell, there are always competitors looking to create something better. And if you’re stuck in the past and refuse to make any notable changes to your product, customer retention is going to be a challenge.A great example of this is Canva. It's a visual editing tool that makes it easier for non-design savvy people (such as myself) to remove background from images, create professional looking graphics and images.While Canva is probably the most well-known tool in the drag-and-drop design space, there are a ton of similar tools on the market.That level of competition has forced Canva to either innovate or get beat out by the long list of competitors. So they’ve done things like add video/GIF creation, text effects, animated stickers and other updates to distinguish themselves.But here’s where a lot of companies go wrong. They make big updates to their product, then just assume people will find out about them. When you’re trying to boost retention, you need to take the initiative and make sure all your customers know about updates you make, even if you don’t think they’re a huge deal. Because even though the update might not seem major, it could be the thing that keeps a customer from cancelling.We use Announcekit to let customers know when we release a new product update.And some companies post updates to their blog.And if you’re not sure what product updates to do first, refer back to tips #1 and #2. You know the feeling of learning something new? The excitement you get when you learn a new skill and start to practice it over and over again. Or when you find out about a new restaurant, so you go back every week to try different dishes.When you can create that feeling for your customers throughout their subscription, you have a much higher chance of retaining them.You could keep releasing more and more product updates to try to capture that feeling. But product updates take time, and there’s only so many you can do on a frequent basis.An easier and more efficient way to keep customers coming back to your product is to keep educating them on how to get more from it.Whether it’s tips on how to use different features, unique use-cases or tactics they might not know about, product education is key for customer retention.If you do it effectively, this type of content can work both for customer retention and acquisition.It’s something we do with our content here at Baremetrics.If you read through some of our articles like this one on how to reduce churn, you’ll notice that we include a ton of tactics that show how to use Baremetrics.The great thing about this approach is it acquires and retains customers.It helps with the top-of-the-funnel acquisition because it shows people who’ve never used your product how it can be valuable to them. And it helps with retention because some of your current customers might not have thought to try the tactics you're showing them.Just make sure the content is useful and actionable for customers.When you incentivize and reward people, they tend to be more loyal to you. Just ask all the major airlines and credit card companies.And one of the best ways to reward customers and improve your retention rates is to create a referral program. It’s a win-win situation. You get new customers through word of mouth, and your customers get rewarded with some type of incentive.The incentive could be a discount on their monthly bill, free credits, or even money.We even recently even started our own referral program through Rewardful for our customers.Since we’re pretty new to the SaaS referral game, I’ll refer you to this guide that goes in depth on how to start your own program.Yes, improving your customer retention rate will give you more revenue. But beyond the monetary reward, it also means people like your product. Like I said in the intro, most people don’t tend to continue to pay for things they don’t use or want.So, make it a priority to figure out how to keep your customers happy (and paying).And if you want tools to track and analyze your customer retention, give us a try for free here.\n"

      "5 SaaS Analytics Tools to Track & Grow Your Business.\n",
      "How are people getting to your website? Is your MRR trending up or down? What features do your most active customers use? What’s your free trial conversion rate?The answers to questions like these will help determine how you market, build and grow your SaaS business. And if you can’t answer these questions, then chances are you don’t have the right SaaS analytics tools.In order to help you out, we put together a list of some of the best SaaS analytics tools out there. And rather than hit you with a gigantic list of 50 tools you’ll never use, we narrowed it down to five tools we know and enjoy.Each tool serves a specific purpose, and combining them together will give the data you need to learn where your business is today, and the steps you can take to grow it in the future.Before we unveil the list, I want to go over how we’re defining SaaS analytics tools here. For the purposes of this article, SaaS analytics tools are any tools that give you data and insights into the performance of your SaaS business.Whether it’s data on how your company’s financial health, SaaS metrics like MRR and churn, web performance or product usage, all these tools help you answer important questions about the state of your SaaS business.So while the tools in our list might fit into different categories, they all work towards the same goal.This is by no means an exhaustive list. There are hundreds, if not thousands of SaaS analytics tools out there. These are five we use (or have used) before, and are great options for SaaS companies of all sizes.Baremetrics is a SaaS analytics tool that pulls in data from your payment provider (like Stripe, Recurly and Chargebee to name a few).Then, we organize it all into charts and reports so you can track and analyze things like churn rate, MRR, growth rate and a ton of other important metrics that clue you into the health of your business.Beyond just giving you the numbers though, you can also segment the data by a long list of criteria, like MRR, signup date, lifetime value, plans, and any other data you’re feeding into Baremetrics.You can use Baremetrics to answer questions related to “traditional” metrics like:Those are the basic questions anyone running a SaaS company needs to know, because they give you direct insights into how your company is doing. For example, if your MRR is falling and churn is rising, you’ve got a problem on your hands.The real fun comes in when you take advantage of segmentation and data augmentation.Baremetrics let’s you connect other data sources like your CRM, marketing automation tool and others so you can answer more advanced questions, like:Having data to answer these questions helps you make better decisions for your business, instead of just guessing and making assumptions.For instance, if you notice an increase in MRR from a specific region, you could put more marketing dollars towards them. Or if one plan is resulting in higher churn than the others, you can dive into why.I won’t dive into it here, but we also have some add-on products you can use to get analytics for customers who cancel, and even failed charges.Google Analytics has become the industry standards for web analytics. From analyzing your traffic to measuring conversions and user behavior, Google Analytics is a super versatile tool you can also use for SaaS Analytics.Google Analytics does a great job of answering most questions related to how people get to your website, and what they do while they’re there, like:One thing you should keep in mind though, is there is some setup involved to get more advanced data. Installing the tracking code on your website is pretty simple, and it’ll give you the basic information like traffic sources and website visitor info.But if you want to go deeper and use Google Analytics to track conversions and “Events” (for example, you can track which buttons on your site get clicked) it’ll take a little more advanced skills. It’s nothing you can’t figure out, but it’s not the type of thing that comes out-of-the-box.Mixpanel is a product analytics tool you can use to analyze how people engage with your software. It gives you insights into your customer experience by allowing you to track things like in-app retention, how people navigate from one feature to another and other actions they take while in your product.With Mixpanel, you can answer questions like:Mixpanel helps you understand how people use your product. Based on what you find, you’ll be able to determine which features you should invest more time into, what features/use-cases to include in your marketing messaging and how to improve the overall user experience inside your product.The end result is higher retention and engagement.Mixpanel has a free plan, and paid plans starting at $24 per month.Metabase is a business intelligence tool that helps you find the answer to questions you have about your business. You connect databases (for example, a database of your customer), and Metbase is able to organize it into charts and graphs based on your questions.You can use Metabase to learn about how customers use your product, how your business is growing and a lot more. You’re really only limited to the data you collect and your own creativity.The questions Metabase can answer depends on your business and the data you connect to it. But here are some examples of ways you could use it:As you can see, the questions can get granular based on your business and the data you collect. Here’s an actual example of how we’ve used Metabase at Baremetrics.I was writing an article about dunning emails, and I wanted to include some benchmarks on open, click and recovery rates for dunning emails.Since we offer a product for sending and tracking dunning emails (which you can check out here), I reached out to one of our engineers and asked if we could use Metabase to get this data. And sure enough, we could!This was the output:We also use Metabase to get a daily update on how many people are trialing and paying for our new Messaging product.If you want some other ideas for how you could use Metabase, I recommend checking out their case studies to see how other businesses have used it. If you have good data and ask the right questions, you can extract some amazing insights for your business.Metabase has an open source version that’s free, and an enterprise version that starts at $10,000 per year.Most SaaS companies have data coming in from a bunch of different tools (Stripe, Google Analytics, CRM, Google Ads, etc.).As a result, you end up with 20 different browser tabs open whenever you want to dive into your analytics. It’s not pretty, and it’s annoying when you’re trying to compare data from multiple sources at once.Databox is an analytics tool you can use to put all those different data sources in one place. Then you can create dashboards and reports to track your business.Similar to Metabase, the questions you can answer with Databox depend on the data sources you connect to it. Here are some example use-cases:If you want more ideas on what questions you can answer with Databox, their template library is a good place to start. One of the main benefits of using Databox though, is having all your data in one place and then creating dashboards that you can look at to get a quick glimpse of how things are going.Databox has a free option, and paid accounts starting from $49/month (with an annual plan).Even if you have all the tools on this list, they’re only as useful as you make them.Before you go off and sign up for a bunch of new software, here are a few tips to get the most from any SaaS analytics tool you buy.It’s easy to get distracted by shiny objects and get subscriptions to every SaaS analytics tool you can get your hands on. But that’s not necessary, and it’s one of the reasons we didn’t make this a “50 SaaS Analytics Tools” list.You don’t even need to get all five of the tools on this list. Think about the stage your company is at, and what value you could get from the data provided by the tools.Here’s a good rule of thumb. If you regularly go more than two or three weeks without using one of your SaaS analytics tools, you might be able to get rid of it.Dashboards can save you a ton of time when you’re using SaaS analytics tools. Being able to login and get a quick snapshot of the data points you need saves you from having to do a bunch of digging.When you’re building dashboards, make sure you choose the metrics that you want to see on a regular basis, and try to limit it to the necessities. Your dashboard shouldn’t just have a graph of every metric the tool you’re using measures.For instance, let’s say in Baremetrics I wanted to be able to quickly check on customers who signed up for accounts this year. I could create a dashboard with metrics from just those customers.Some tools like Google Analytics even have an entire library of dashboards, so you don’t even have to start from scratch. Trust me, they’ll make your life a lot easier.Having data is one thing, knowing how to analyze it is where the real value comes in. You’ll notice that the tools in our list all allow you to go beyond surface level metrics to uncover more actionable insights.That’s the difference between reporting and analyzing. Reporting tells you what happened, analyzing tells you why.Your analysis should always start with a question. That question might come from a co-worker (i.e. your boss wants to know what the biggest opportunities for MRR growth are), your own curiosity, or something interesting you noticed when checking your dashboards.For example, let’s say I was looking at our blog traffic for the month and noticed this spike on the 27th.The question for my analysis would be “where did the spike in blog traffic on the 27th come from?”To answer it, we’d go to that specific day and see the most viewed pages, and possibly compare it to another day. And we’d see the spike came from a guest post that got shared on Twitter, email and a few other sites.Don’t just look at the numbers in a report or dashboard and call it a day. Learn why the numbers are what they are.I can’t stress the importance of using data and analytics enough. No matter how great your natural instinct is, data can give you so much information to make important decisions.Give the SaaS analytics tools on our list a try, and learn more about your business than you’ve ever known.\n"

      "How to Write a Subscription Cancellation Email for SaaS.\n",
      "Below are some key tips to crafting cancellation messages, including an email template that you can totally steal for yourself.So many subscription cancellation emails consist of little more than “sorry to see you go.”Here’s the reality, though: cancellations aren’t the time to be all woe-is-me. As a result of thumb, here are four things any subscription cancellation email should accomplish (hint: it’s more than saying “sorry”):That’s it. This four-part formula is standard for most SaaS companies, and based on it, we can put together a quick subscription cancellation email template below:Hi [customer name],First of all, we appreciate you being part of the [company name] community.As per your request, your subscription has been canceled. The good news is that your account will be active until [date] and you can still access [feature] in the meantime.We’d like to learn the reason behind your cancellation so we can better serve our customers (and hopefully you!) in the future [+link to survey, form, etc].ThanksThe goal here is to suggest some sort of next step with your customers rather than just wave goodbye or apologize. Proactive, actionable messages signal that you're still open to working with customers and actually value their opinions. This is obviously preferable to slamming the door on your cancellations by sending a lifeless autoresponder.The takeaway here? Learn what’s going on with your customers before letting them slip away.For every subscription cancellation email you send, follow-ups and confirmations should follow. Many SaaS companies unfortunately fail to do so, leaving plenty of money on the table as a result. Related Read: 5 Winback Email Examples SaaS Customers Can't Resist (Plus, Templates)Here’s another example from ContentKing:This approach makes your messages feel like they were written by individuals, not part of a company-wide blast. Likewise, this encourages you to curate more authentic, off-the-cuff feedback that you might not get from a cancellation survey.See how that works?\n",
      "How to Improve Your MRR Growth Rate (without new customers).\n",
      "Contrary to what you might see in some case studies, MRR growth is not always linear.Through working with various SaaS companies, talking to founders and even looking at our journey here at Baremetrics, I’ve seen firsthand how startups can experience periods of flat or even negative growth.And when it happens, so many companies default to “how do we get more customers?”There’s a common misconception that the only way to improve MRR growth is by getting more customers. Not only is this untrue, but that mindset can dig you into a hole that’s hard to get out of. I’ll explain why later.Don’t get me wrong. Getting more users to pay you is a good thing. But MRR growth is about more than just getting new customers. In this article, I’ll break down what MRR growth is, how to calculate it and how to improve it without only relying on new customers.I know a lot of you are probably going to jump right past this part. But stick with me for a second.In order to understand how to improve your MRR growth rate, you need to understand how to calculate the metric.MRR growth is the change in your MRR over a period of time.The start and end numbers are helpful, but what a lot of companies (and investors) want to see is your MRR growth rate.MRR growth rate is your MRR growth expressed as a percentage.Here’s the formula to calculate your monthly MRR growth rate:[(Second Month Revenue) - (First Month Revenue)] / (First Month Revenue)And here’s what a MRR growth rate chart looks like in Baremetrics. You’ll notice it pretty much mirrors the screenshot of our actual MRR above.Your MRR growth rate is important because it shows how much you’re growing (or not growing) over time. If your growth rate is slow, or even declining for an extended period of time, it could be a red flag. And according to Tim Schumacher, founder of SaaS.group, MRR growth plays an important role in your company’s valuation if you plan on selling.From an Angel or VC investor point of view, slow or no MRR growth is definitely a red flag, since all investors look for high-growth companies. For a strategic or financial buyer, it's a different story. Of course, MRR growth is always better than slow or no growth, but at the end of the day, it merely affects the multiple which is paid for a company.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a high-growth company (5%+ monthly growth), a seller might be able to get twice the revenue (or profit) multiple compared to the same company which is flat.Here’s the thing. Your MRR growth rate is just an output.In order to improve it, you need to focus on the inputs (i.e. the numbers that go into calculating your MRR growth). As you saw, the formula for calculating your MRR growth is pretty simple on the surface. You just need to know your starting MRR and your ending MRR. But in order to take action on the number, you need to focus on the period in between.Here’s a graphic to illustrate what I’m talking about.All of the points on the graph are events that caused your MRR to go up or down. Those are the “inputs” that determine your MRR growth rate. They include things like:By manipulating these different inputs, you directly impact your company’s MRR growth.  For example, if you see a drop in your MRR growth, it could be that churn is outpacing new customer acquisition. If you’re flat, it could be a sign that your product isn’t priced for growth. There are any number of possibilities.Our goal is to optimize all these different inputs so we can see a positive impact on the output (MRR growth). But just getting more customers isn’t always the answer.Like I mentioned in the intro, when you see your MRR growth stall or even decline, it’s natural to assume you just need more customers.And while that can help, here’s why I suggest putting just as much (if not more) effort into the other inputs.If you’ve ever worked for a SaaS company that was primarily focused on customer acquisition as a growth strategy, I’m sure you’ve seen how expensive it can get.The “get new customers at all costs” approach is particularly popular with highly funded companies. When you have millions of dollars to spend, it’s super tempting to throw it at ads and other marketing channels to get more users.But if the rest of your customer journey is lacking, you could be wasting a lot of money.Until you’ve built a solid retention strategy that reduces churn and improves LTV, it doesn’t make a ton of sense to focus on getting more people in the door. Assuming you’re not a new company that just needs users of course.Another issue with focusing primarily on customer acquisition, is it limits your potential MRR growth. I’ll dive into the specifics in the next section, but one of the keys behind our MRR growth at Baremetrics was our focus on expansion revenue.By creating add-on products like Cancellation Insights, Messaging and Recover, we were able to When all you’re thinking about is “how can I get new customers?”, you completely miss out on other opportunities that can dramatically improve your MRR growth.Lastly, sometimes the reason you can’t grow just doesn’t have anything to do with your ability to acquire new customers.Even if your number of active customers is growing each month, that doesn’t mean your MRR growth rate is too. You could be experiencing massive MRR churn if your new customers are paying less than the people that churned. Your average revenue per user might be too low. You could be experiencing a lot of contraction from people downgrading their accounts.The point is, you should never just assume your MRR growth isn’t trending upwards because you’re not getting enough new customers.Now that we’ve established that, let’s talk about some other ways to improve your MRR growth rate besides getting new customers.Now that you know the what and why, let’s talk about the “how”. Just knowing your MRR growth rate is fine. But ultimately, your goal should be to improve it. Like most things in business, data can be your best friend here. Let’s take a look at some practical ways to boost your MRR growth.If you can’t control your churn, acquiring new customers isn’t going to fix your MRR growth problems. It’s like trying to work out to compensate for your poor diet. You might get some short term results, but eventually you’re going to plateau.When you have a balance of low churn plus an effective customer acquisition strategy, you’re in a position for real growth. Let’s talk about how to start chipping away at your churn.Obviously, you want to decrease your churn overall. But that’s a big mountain to climb. Instead, let’s break it down into a series of “hills”. That way, you’ll be able to get some smaller wins on your way up the mountain.First, we’ll need to identify where most of your churn is coming from. That means tracking the cancellation reasons that are costing you the most money.You can do that with a tool like Cancellation Insights, which sends a cancellation survey to every user when they cancel their account.Now, instead of asking “how do we decrease churn?” you have specific action items you can build a plan around. Whether it’s the lack of a specific feature, bad onboarding or whatever the main cause, you know exactly why people are churning and can work towards fixing it.Even if your customer acquisition stays flat (meaning you’re acquiring the same number of customers each month), if you can decrease your monthly churn you’ll see an improvement in your MRR growth because you’re losing less MRR.Here’s an example of this in action from our own company.You can see here that as our churn rate has gone down over the past six months, our MRR growth has increased. While some of the improvement in our MRR growth rate is from our increase in expansion revenue (from our add-on products), decreasing churn plays a major role.Our churn over the past six monthsOur MRR growth rate over the past six monthsThe main point I’m trying to illustrate is that “more customers” isn’t the only (or even best) way to improve your MRR growth rate. If you can lose fewer customers each month, while keeping your acquisition and expansion revenue at least steady, you can still see growth. If you want more ideas on how to reduce churn, check out these articles:Sometimes, increasing revenue doesn’t mean getting new customers. Why not sell to your existing customers who already use and like your product?Expansion revenue is revenue you get from existing customers through:According to data from KeyBanc, in 2018 the average SaaS company generated 37% of gross new ARR bookings from expansions and upsells (for companies with $5M+ in ARR). And the companies in the $15M+ ARR club tend to do even more.An added benefit of expansion revenue is it costs less to upsell and expand your existing customers than to acquire new ones.Think about it. You’re essentially selling to people who’ve already shown they’re willing to buy from you, versus trying to convince new people that your product is worth paying for.Expansion revenue has also been a big part of our growth here at Baremetrics. Here’s a look at MRR from our current active customers using two of our add-on products.And if you take a look at our MRR over the past six months, you’ll notice that our expansion revenue is greater than our MRR from new customers most months.Expansion revenue is also key to MRR growth for companies that charge on a per-user basis. For example, take a look at Hubstaff.Their monthly pricing plans are pretty low (most users are on their Basic or Premium plans).In order for them to get positive MRR growth, they’re almost completely dependent on how many new customers they’re able to acquire each month, minus churn and contractions.That’s a more challenging situation for growth.Expansion revenue gives you another lever you can pull on to improve your MRR growth. Whether it’s through upgrades, charging per user, or additional products, think of ways you can expand beyond your current plans and offerings.Pricing your SaaS product is one of the biggest struggles startups run into. Are you charging too much? Not enough? What happens if you raise your prices and customers start to churn?I won’t dive into the specifics of how to price your product in this article, because our Head of Growth already wrote a super in-depth guide to SaaS pricing here. But here’s a good way to experiment with your pricing and improve your MRR growth.Use your data!Some companies like to use surveys using Van Westendorp’s Price Sensitivity Meter to determine how much users would be willing to pay. But if you already have paying customers, why not use that data instead?Start by identifying which pricing plans have the lowest churn rates. If you have Baremetrics, you can find this data under Metrics > User Churn. Sort the table by churn rate.Lower churn (and longer time to churn) is an indicator that users under these price plans are getting enough value from your product to justify keeping it long term. But it could also mean that you’re priced too low.The plans with low churn and a long time to churn are the ones that you can experiment with first.Slightly increase the pricing on one of these plans (for new customers only) and monitor:If the number of signups you’re getting each month stays consistent, it means people aren’t being put off by your slightly higher pricing. And if your churn rate stays relatively unchanged, then your value:price ratio is in a good spot.Even if you keep all your current customer’s pricing unchanged, you’ll be able to boost your MRR growth going forward if your changes work.Your MRR growth rate is a vital SaaS metric that gives you an indication of how your business is doing over time.You don’t have to obsess over the number on a daily basis. Check it month to month to see how you’re trending. Then use the insights to create action items for the next few months. You could focus on churn for one quarter, then do some pricing experiments another quarter. But at least you’ll have a plan. And since you have metrics in place, it’s easy to measure what works and what doesn’t.\n"

      "How to Create Cancellation Surveys That Get a Response.\n",
      "What’s the first thing you do after a customer cancels their account?If you answered “send a cancellation survey to find out why”, you win!Unfortunately, a lot of SaaS and subscription companies either:Neither of those responses are helpful to you or your customers.When you send cancellation surveys, you get to learn why customers are churning, and you’re also giving your users an opportunity to voice their opinion.But not all cancellation surveys are effective. In this article, I’ll break down what cancellation surveys are, the best way to create and send them, and what you should do with the responses. Let’s dive in!A cancellation survey is a series of questions you send to users who’ve cancelled to learn about why they cancelled and their overall experience with your product.Typically, you send a cancellation survey immediately after a customer cancels their account. That way, your product is still fresh on their mind and they’ll be more likely to give you a response.Cancellation surveys can be an insanely valuable way to learn why customers are churning and to steer the direction of your product.For instance, Usersnap took the small step of adding a field in their unsubscribe page for users to tell them why they want to cancel. After collecting some responses, they spotted a common trend.Customers only saw a one-time need for their product, which limited their customer lifetime value and resulted in fast churn.They took that feedback and created a new product line that gave users a reason to stick around longer. The result was more long term customers and lower churn.While Usersnap put their cancellation reason right into their unsubscribe page, that’s not the only way to conduct the survey. Let’s talk about how to actually create and send your cancellation survey to customers.If you go this route, what you’ll do is create the survey then send the link to users after they cancel. Some of these tools also allow you to embed your forms on your website.The benefit of this method is it’s free. The downside is “free” usually comes with some restrictions like less customization and you’ll likely have to do some manual work to connect your survey results to the rest of your subscription data.Another method (which is what I’d recommend) is to use a tool specifically for SaaS cancellations. Shameless plug, but we actually built one.Here’s how it works.You create a form where users can choose their cancellation reason.You can send this survey through email, which looks like this.Or embed the form on your cancellation page.When the user chooses their cancellation reason, it saves to their account profile in Baremetrics. So you can see exactly when and why each customer cancels (without having to import it from another tool).Last but not least, we aggregate all the data from the survey so you can see which cancellation reasons are most common, and which cost you the most revenue.If you’re interested in giving Cancellation Insights a try, you can check it out for free here.What you put in your cancellation survey is going to play a big role in the number of people who actually complete it.Remember, you’re sending this survey to people who’ve just cancelled and decided your product isn’t for them. So they’re probably not in the mood to fill out a 10 minute survey.So first, let’s talk about how long your survey should be.Survey Monkey did some research into survey completion rates, and here are some key points I took from their findings:With all this in mind, what should you include in your cancellation survey? Well, here’s what we do at Baremetrics.First, we send the initial cancellation survey that just asks for a cancellation reason. Then, we send the follow-up email that asks for any additional feedback. Here’s what the process looks like.Initial survey:After they choose a response, we send this follow-up email to get more details:From there, we might do an exit interview to get more feedback.Notice how the flow is simple and doesn’t require much heavy lifting on the user’s part.Some companies turn their cancellation surveys into a product usage and customer satisfaction survey all-in-one. The problem with those is they tend to be longer, and you collect data that you probably won’t act on.For instance here’s an example of a cancellation survey from a company with a couple of common questions SaaS companies ask.The reason I’d suggest steering away from questions like “do you think you will use X again” and “how likely are you to recommend us to a friend” is because without additional context, the responses aren’t actionable. If someone replies they’d “probably” recommend your product to a friend, what will you do with that info?And let’s say 40% of people responded they wouldn’t use your product again, what would you do with the data? Unless they follow up with more details, there’s not much you can do besides make assumptions.Compare this to our example, where we only ask for their cancellation reason. Even if the user doesn’t follow up with us at all, just knowing the reason they cancelled at least gives us something to work with.If you want to go beyond just asking for a cancellation reason, make your questions more actionable. For instance:Notice how the questions focus on what the user didn’t like. I’ve seen cancellation surveys where the company asks “what was your favorite part about [product]. That’s not a great question to ask someone who just cancelled. Whatever their favorite feature was, it wasn’t enough to justify them keeping your product. So it makes more sense to get an idea of what people are leaving.But long story short, I’d highly recommend just getting the cancellation reason, then sending a follow-up email to get more information.After sending your cancellation survey, most companies just leave it at that. But the conversation doesn’t have to end there.Here are some things you can do after you send your cancellation survey to make sure the info you gather doesn't go to waste.An exit interview is one of the best ways to get qualitative feedback for users who’ve cancelled. Surveys are great, but in exit interviews, you can dive deeper into the specifics of why users cancelled.Just like your survey, your exit interview should focus on what went wrong and what they didn’t like. I know, it’s hard to hear negative things about your product, but you need it in order to make improvements.I asked our head of growth, who does our exit interviews, for some good questions to ask. Here’s what he recommended:All these questions are great for digging into the specifics of why users cancelled, beyond their initial cancellation reason.If you’re not going to take action on the feedback you’re getting from your cancellation surveys, there’s no point in even doing them.Don’t just do these surveys because you read an article that said they’re a good idea. The responses can give you ideas on how to prevent more customers from cancelling.Here’s an example of how we used our cancellation survey results to reduce churn. When COVID first hit, we saw some higher-than-usual churn. Looking through the cancellation reasons, we noticed a common trend.A lot of users weren't canceling because they didn’t want our product. They were just trying to cut back on expenses until things normalized.So we reached out to customers who wanted to cancel due to COVID and offered a discount to keep them on board. While we took a short-term hit on revenue from the discount, the value of keeping these customers long term is worth it.Pay attention to the responses you get from your cancellation surveys to find opportunities like this to not only prevent churn in the future, but potentially save customers who are about to cancel right now.If you really want to take things to the next level, you can follow-up with people who respond to your cancellation survey a few weeks (or even months) afterwards.People’s needs change every day. So while your product might not have been a good fit at that moment, it doesn’t mean things won’t change in the future. Maybe they switched to a competitor but realized the grass isn’t always greener. Or maybe you released some new features that would tempt them enough to come back.Create an automatic follow-up email to go to customers who cancelled and see if there’s a chance to win them back. Here’s how to do it with Baremetrics Messaging.Assuming you already have your cancellation survey set up, you can use Messaging to create customized follow-up emails for days, weeks or even months after a customer cancels.First, we’ll set up a custom audience to send the emails to. It’ll be people who’ve cancelled their account, haven’t unsubscribed from emails and then we’ll choose a specific cancellation reason.Here’s the important thing to keep in mind. You should create different emails for each cancellation reason.For example, for customers who switched to a different product, your email might ask how the new product is working for them. If their cancellation reason was because you’re missing a specific feature, you could include some of the new features you launched since the time they cancelled.Or if there was no specific reason, you could send an email like this:Then, just set when you want to send these emails.If you need some ideas and inspiration for what to write in your email, check out these win back email templates.Cancellation surveys can be an amazing way to improve your product, reduce churn and even save customers who are ready to cancel. You just have to approach it the right way in order to get valuable info.Keep your surveys simple, read the responses and take action.\n"

      "SaaS Customer Onboarding: A Simple (But Detailed) Guide.\n",
      "If you screw up your customer’s experience early on in their subscription, it’s hard to convince them to keep paying month after month.And since SaaS and subscription businesses depend on monthly recurring revenue to grow, it pays to perfect your customer onboarding process.Give your customers a poor onboarding experience and they’ll be set up for failure right from the start. It'll be harder for them to see the value in your product or how it can solve their problem.But if you get it right, not only will you have less churn and a higher lifetime value, but you’ll also spend less time and resources on support.What separates a poor customer onboarding experience from a bad one? And what do you need to do to guarantee every new user understands how your product can make their life easier?That’s what this article is all about. Let’s onboard some new customers.Customer onboarding is the process of getting your customers setup to successfully use your product.When I say “successfully,” I mean they’re able to use your product to solve whatever problem caused them to need your product in the first place. For instance, if a customer bought your social media analytics software to track the performance of their marketing campaigns, your onboarding process should show them how to do that.What separates a great customer onboarding experience from mediocre (or flat out bad) one is your ability to go beyond just showing customers how to navigate your software. You need to show them how to effectively use it to maximize their experience.Here’s a good way to think about it. Let’s say you were going to teach someone how to drive. Would you just show them where everything is (gas/brake pedals, turning signals, etc.) and just leave them to it? Or would you tell them about how much pressure to apply on the pedals. How to read all the numbers on the dash. When to use the emergency brake. All those details are what will allow them to drive correctly and prevent them from completely wrecking the car.That’s the same way you should think about customer onboarding. Don’t just show them all the pretty buttons. Show them how to use everything based on what they’re trying to accomplish.I could list off a bunch of statistics to show the importance of customer onboarding. But honestly, it really comes down to this: If your customers don’t know how to use your product, they’re not going to keep paying for it.That should be all the motivation you need to make sure you’re onboarding your customers effectively. But beyond that, a good onboarding process will:Long story short, onboard your customers. It’s helpful, trust us.You know something is important when there’s an entire industry built around it. That’s the case with customer onboarding.There are tons of tools out there that’ll help you setup, implement and track your customer onboarding process. Here are some worth checking out:Nobody sets out to build a product that’s confusing to use. You might think your product is easy to set up and understand. But that’s not always the case. I’m sure you can think of a tool or two you’ve paid for that was overly-complicated and painful to use.Even if your product is fairly easy to use, it never hurts to show new users around.Product tours have quickly become one of the most common customer onboarding tactics for SaaS companies. They make it easier for users to get to know the ins and outs of your product without having to schedule full-on demos.Plus, they can be a great way to increase user engagement and ensure that customers get more use out of your product.Luckily, there are plenty of tools to help you set up tours inside your product. Here’s a quick list of some options (there are tons of others):When you’re onboarding users, communication is crucial. You need to be with them throughout the entire process to make sure any questions they have get answered, and they don’t feel lost or confused about your product.The best way to do that is through a customer messaging tool. Messaging tools allow you to create and send a sequence of emails to users throughout their entire onboarding experience. You’re basically guiding them through how to get setup and use your product.I’ll dive into more specifics a little later on. But for now, just make sure you have a tool in place. Naturally, customers are going to have a lot of questions when they’re learning how to use your product. Unless you want to spend all day answering product questions, I highly recommend setting up some type of helpdesk software.Ideally, you want a 1-2 punch:Luckily, there are plenty of tools available for this too:Since we’re in the business of analytics, we like using data to make better decisions. And that includes your customer onboarding process.One of the goals of customer onboarding is to get users to engage with your product and all its different features. With product analytics tools, you can measure how users interact with your software.For instance, maybe you want to see which features are used the most by customers in the first week of signing up. Getting that level of insights can help you shape your customer onboarding process by learning which features new users are most interested in. Here are some popular product analytics tools you can consider checking out:Having an onboarding process in place is one thing. But how do you know whether or not it’s actually working?There are plenty of things you can track to get insights into how your onboarding tactics are doing. Here are a few.If you offer a trial period for your product, one of the biggest signs that your customer onboarding process is working (or not working) is your trial-to-customer conversion rate. Customers who’ve been successfully onboarded and understand the value of your product are more likely to convert than someone who hasn’t really been engaged during the trial period.If you’re using Baremetrics, you can easily see changes in your conversions in the Trial Insights dashboard.If you don’t notice a change in your conversion rate or average trial length, you might want to tweak your onboarding process to improve conversions.Another metric you can tie back to customer onboarding is churn. Specifically, you want to look at your user churn rate and churn time.The reason churn time is so important is it gives you an idea of what might’ve gone wrong. For instance, if your average churn time is 18 months, then it’s probably not an issue with your onboarding. But if customers are constantly churning within 30-60 days, it’s a sign that something’s going wrong early on. And improving your onboarding process could be the solution.In our guide to cohort analysis, I walk you through exactly how to find whether or not your onboarding process is the cause of your churn.Those first two approaches are great for giving you quantitative info about how well (or not-so-great) your customer onboarding process is. But if you want more qualitative data, you can ask customers why they’re cancelling their accounts.Then, track the cancellation reasons and look for trends. Specifically, pay attention to people cancelling because they don’t understand how to use your product, didn’t see the value in it or any other potential issues that could be tied back to your onboarding process.If you want to learn how to extract these insights, read my 3-step guide to churn analysis. It goes through how to find out which customers are churning, and why.There are other things you can measure, like product engagement, but the three we covered will give you a good starting point.Alright, now that we have a good overview of what customer onboarding is, and how to track it, let’s talk about how to set up your own process.The goal is to walk new customers through how to use your product and make sure they’re getting the most value as possible.Keep in mind that not all SaaS companies approach onboarding the same way. But if you can nail these seven elements, you’ll have a recipe for an amazing customer onboarding experience.Some people will argue that onboarding doesn’t actually start until after a user signs up. But your signup process is a golden opportunity to kickoff your onboarding.Immediately after signing up, where do you direct users?A lot of companies send them to:Here’s a quick story to show why those aren’t the most effective approach.Last year I went to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. I went to the front desk, got my tickets, and the representative didn’t give me any direction. They didn’t ask what I was interested in. They didn’t tell me what exhibits they had. They didn’t tell me about how to join a tour or anything.So I wandered around aimlessly and tried to navigate around the museum myself. There are multiple stories in the building and a lot to see. So needless to say, it can be a little overwhelming particularly if you’re not an art connoisseur.When you send new users to a thank you page or the main page of your app after they’ve just signed up, you’re putting them in the exact same position I was in at the museum. You’re forcing them to wander around your product aimlessly.Will they eventually find their way around your product? Probably. But just like me in the museum, it’ll be more difficult for them to get the full experience and enjoyment without some guidance from the experts (in this case, you).The workaround is simple. Immediately after signing up (or within the signup process), guide them through the setup process.Here’s an example from Lumen5. After signing up for an account, the very next screen you see is this one, asking what your goal is.This information helps them understand more about who their customers are, and makes it easier to customize their onboarding experience.After this step, they take you through the process of creating your first video.By guiding new users through the process of using your product right after signup, you’re increasing the likelihood that they’ll (a) understand how to use your tool and (b) be an engaged user right from the start.Immediately after a new user signs up, you should send them a welcome email. This email should push new users back to your product. This step is particularly important if you don’t have an in-app welcome sequence in place like the Lumen5 example.Also, make sure you send new users follow-up emails after the initial message. But more on that later.I also suggest taking a look at these 9 onboarding email templates for new users.The first time a user logs into your product, they shouldn’t feel lost. Like I mentioned earlier, even if you think your product is super intuitive, you shouldn’t assume everyone will be able to jump right in and use it.Let’s go back to my museum experience for a second. Imagine if instead of just randomly walking throughout the building, there was a guide to show me around and point out where all the exhibits were. I probably would’ve had a different experience.During customer onboarding, you need to be that “tour guide” for your product when users first log in.But unless you never sleep, you obviously can’t personally walk every new user through your product when they first login. That’s where those product tour tools I talked about earlier come into play. You can use tools like Chameleon, Userpilot and Userlane to create self-guided product tours.For example, when you first log into Loomly, you’re prompted to create a social media calendar, and they walk you through the process step-by-step.If you don’t want to go that route, you can even show users a video walkthrough when they first sign-in like this example from Wrike.First, they prompt you to choose a template.Then you get a video that shows you how to set up your workspace.Either of these tactics is better than doing nothing at all. Don’t leave new users hanging. Be their tour guide.Even if you have the most helpful guided walkthrough in the world, your customers are likely going to have questions at some point during their onboarding process.Documentation is one of the best ways to let customers self-service their support issues. The more thorough and detailed your product documentation is, the less time you (or your support team) has to spend answering the same questions over and over again.Every SaaS company should have a help center of some sort where customers can get answers to the most common questions users have about your product. As a fall back, you can also leverage canned responses to quickly answer commonly asked questions over live chat.According to one article, 81% of customers try to lookup answers to their questions themselves before reaching out to customer support.But just having a knowledge base isn’t enough though. You need to tell your customers about it. Remember in our welcome email I showed you earlier, we link directly to our help center.Loomly does the same in their email confirmation messageAlso, your knowledge base shouldn’t be static. You should constantly add new support articles as you add new features and your business grows.But to start, you should have:Remember, your help center doesn’t need to be perfect. At least cover the basics to start, and you can always update it later. Before you know it, you’ll have something as wild as Canva’s help center!One thing I’ve learned throughout my years as a marketer is that people learn differently. Some people prefer to read articles. Some like to watch videos. Others prefer audio.The same principle applies to customer onboarding. Some of your users are going to be cool with watching a 3-4 minute overview of your product. Some people will just dive in and learn as they go. Others will read through every help desk article you’ve ever written. And then you’ll have some who prefer webinars/workshops.Webinars are great for a lot of reasons, but two of them are:One of the most common things that stops people from doing customer onboarding webinars is the belief that the webinars need to be live. Most people don’t want to spend every day hosting a webinar. And luckily, you don’t have to.Here are a few common options to consider:The benefit of option A is it provides the most engaging experience for new users. They can ask questions as you’re presenting, so each webinar/workshop is more personalized. The downside is that it takes up more time and resources. So this approach is best for larger companies with a high volume of new users each day/week. Option B is a good hands-free approach that’ll save you a lot of time. It’s ideal for SaaS products that don’t require a ton of customization. For instance, a tool like Tailwind only has so many use-cases. People use it to manage their Pinterest and Instagram accounts. So an on-demand webinar that shows the different features of the product  makes sense.On the other hand, think of a product like Monday. It’s like a freaking Swiss Army Knife of tools. You can use it for project management, as a CRM, content calendar and dozens of other things. Plus, it has a ton of different features. It’s difficult to have a pre-recorded webinar that’s going to satisfy all their potential customers if they aren’t able to ask questions during it. That probably explains why they do daily webinars, in addition to on-demand ones.Option C is something I found out about from one of the SaaS companies I used to work with. They would pre-record webinars and treat them like live workshops. Customers signed up for a specific date/time. Then, the company would play the pre-recorded webinar and respond to questions in the chat.This method works well if you want to engage with attendees, but don’t necessarily want to host a live webinar on a regular basis.Once you decide on how you want to host your webinars/workshops, the next step is promoting them. You can do that via email like Lumen5 does in their welcome email.Or in-product like Help Scout.If you have the time and ability to create webinars to onboard new customers, go for it. If you’re camera shy or just aren’t the best presenter, you can also look into hiring a freelancer from a site like Upwork to do it for you.In-app messaging and notifications seems to have really taken off in the past few years. Whether it’s because there are more tools that allow you to do it now, or SaaS companies are just starting to realize how effective it can be, in-app notifications are really popular.There are a lot of different ways you can use in-app notifications during customer onboarding.For instance, you can create a “Getting started” checklist that pops up during onboarding. As users complete different tasks in your tool, they get checked off the list. Here’s an example from Frase.Another way to use in-app notifications during customer onboarding is to re-engage inactive users, or let them know when something’s wrong with their account.Here’s an example from Fitbit. If you go too long without syncing your activity tracker to the app, they show a notification to help you reconnect.If you want to do something similar, you can build these features directly into your product, or use tools like Appcues and Pendo.Once a customer has signed up and used your product for a while, it’s easy to stop the onboarding process. After a month or so, a lot of companies assume that customers have a good grasp of the product and will reach out if they have any issues.But in the SaaS business, it doesn’t pay to be passive. Get proactive and reach out to customers throughout their time with you just to check-in and keep the onboarding process going.One company that does a great job of this is Sprout Social. Long after you’ve signed up, they continue to email you with new training, webinars and even in-app messages.Most companies have a customer onboarding email flow that runs for maybe a month. But Sprout continues for months.In general, it’s never a bad idea to ask your customers if they need help or show them how to get more out of your product. There’s no rule that says you can only onboard customers “X” number of days.Customer onboarding is a crucial part of running a SaaS company. If your customers don’t know how to use your product or feel lost, they’re more likely to cancel their account purely out of frustration.If you want to increase your customer LTV and reduce churn, put the time and effort into improving your customer onboarding process. It’s worth it.\n"

      "9 Onboarding Email Templates to Engage New Users.\n",
      "Be honest: are your onboarding emails actually getting users excited about your product?The onboarding process is obviously make-or-break if you’re in SaaS. Either your sign-ups stick around for the long haul or those could-be users disappear into the abyss.Meanwhile, it’s oft-cited that ~50% of SaaS users will log into an account and never return. Couple that with a ~21% open rate for software emails as of 2020, and it’s clear than sign-ups are anything but a sure thing.But hey, it’s not all gloom and doom.Granted you’re putting together messages that actively engage those sign-ups to take action.In this guide, we’ll hook you up with some onboarding email templates to do exactly that.Below we’ve put together nine onboarding emails that are fair game for any SaaS company.Of course, you’ll need to tweak and adapt these according to your brand voice, product and so on.Also, you might consider swapping out or duplicating these templates based on how long your onboarding series is (think: a week versus 10 days or two weeks).Your onboarding welcome emails are arguably the most important in your series.After all, you’re tasked with making a meaningful first impression on your new sign-ups. You obviously want to hook them here and score that ever-so-important initial login. Your end-game? Get your product in their hands ASAP.Hey {user name},Thank you for signing up for {app name} and welcome to the community!We’re stoked to see what you’re able to {action (create, do, etc)} with our {app, tool, service}. To get started, we recommend checking out our {quick-start guide} that’ll walk you through the basics of {app name} step-by-step. We also have a {two-minute intro video} if you’re more of a movie buff.And if you’re ready to start {action (creating, exploring, etc)}, you can log in below!{CTA button}Cheers!Sometimes sign-ups need a bit of nudge to get started with a new SaaS tool.Maybe they’re initially overwhelmed by your interface. Perhaps they remember signing up but need a quick refresher as to why they need your service.And hey, you never know. There are tons of reasons why someone might have slept on your welcome message (lost among Amazon shipping notifications, deleted by accident, weird time zones, etc).Your goal here is to highlight basic features and suggested steps to get a taste of what your software is capable of.Hey {user name},Need a bit of help getting started with {app name}? Hey, we get it: there’s so much you can do!Here are a few suggestions to get better acquainted with us (and start {seeing benefit}):{Action/feature #1, optional link and/or corresponding resource to help}{Action/feature #2, optional link and/or corresponding resource to help}{Action/feature #3, optional link and/or corresponding resource to help}If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to us at {contact}.Cheers!Food for thought: case studies are among the most effective types of content for B2B buyers.Bringing up customers and case studies is a brilliant way to invite your sign-ups to feel like they’re part of a community. Highlighting use cases also makes your product seem much more actionable.And if nothing else, these types of messages are prime for attention-grabbing subject lines that include striking stats and numbers.Hey {user name},We love it when our customers win.If you’re looking for inspiration on how to use {app name}, you should totally check out {case study company/user}’s story. They managed to {save # of hours, generate # of revenue, drive # traffic/followers, etc} using our {app, service, tool}.You can {watch/read} their story below:{CTA button}Hopefully, you‘ve been rocking it with {app name} so far. And who knows, maybe you’ll be our next success story. Here’s to hoping!Cheers!Ask yourself: if there’s a single feature you’d want your new sign-ups to check out, what would it be? What’s going to keep them glued to your product versus that of your competitors? Important features are good to emphasize in onboarding emails, especially if they’re time-sensitive and expire prior to an upgrade. These types of messages are hype-worthy, allowing you to get creative with your subject line(s).Hey there, {user name}We just wanted to check in to make sure you’re not missing out on {app name}’s most powerful feature.{Description of notable feature, highlight benefit(s) and/or use cases}You can get started with {feature} by {logging in below, checking out this tutorial/video}. Our community swears by it and we think you’ll dig it, too.{CTA button}Cheers!Note that many SaaS company emails are presented on behalf of employees rather than companies themselves.That’s not just a stylistic choice. Fact: “personal correspondence” (#1) and “content that was made just for me” (#6) are among the top reasons people engage with emails according to data from Campaign Monitor.This is an opportunity to switch up your tone a bit by getting personal. Here you can present yourself purely as a helping hand rather than a company presenting a sales pitch.Hey there, {user name},This is {name} from {app name}. I just wanted to personally thank you for using {app} and joining our community. We’re glad to have you!If you have any questions about your trial so far, I’d be more than happy to answer them.Oh, and I also wanted to give you a quick heads up on a couple of my favorite features of {app} that you might not have checked out yet:{Action/feature #1, highlight benefits and link to relevant resources}{Action/feature #1, highlight benefits and link to relevant resources}Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any help!

Time flies.We not only want to take a moment to thank you for being part of our community but also see if there was anything we could do to help {address pain point}. And if you’re interested in potentially extending your trial or upgrading your account, let us know below.{CTA button}ThanksHere it is: the last-ditch effort. These messages are for folks who maybe read a few of your onboarding emails but never engaged properly. This is your opportunity to thank them for their time and leave the door open to do business together down the road.Hi {user name},All good things come to an end, right?

After your new subscriber has had an opportunity to give your product a proper spin, consider letting them in on an upgrade or add-on offer.Doing so early on in their customer lifecycle can ultimately help them see the full scope of your product and its benefits, priming them to become a long-term subscriber.The key here is to hammer home the benefits of the upgrade rather than get too in the weeds about specific features.Hey there {user name},Hope you’ve been enjoying everything that {app name} has to offer!Speaking of which, we wanted to give you a quick heads up on some premium features included in our {upgrade name} plan.{Benefit (ex: get even more done)}. {Benefit (ex: dig deeper into your data)}. {Benefit (ex: share more with your team)}.Here’s a quick sneak peak of our leveled-up product in action:{Screenshot, .GIF}If you’re interested in upgrading or want to see how our premium users are taking advantage of {add on}, check it out:{CTA button}Either way, let us know if you have any questions and thanks for being part of our community.Cheers!Crafting a positive onboarding experience is among the most important customer retention strategies.And so understanding the anatomy of top-performing onboarding emails is a plus for SaaS marketers.To wrap things up, we’ll quickly review some best practices of onboarding emails (and why they’re worth sticking to).You probably noticed that most of our onboarding templates were pretty short and to-the-point, right?Sure, there’s plenty of debate over the “ideal” length of a business email (although recent research seems to point the 50 to the 125-word range as the sweet spot).Rather than obsess over word count, consider the purpose of your onboarding emails in the first place. You don’t need to provide in-depth tutorials or instructions for your sign-ups. All of that happens after they click through your call-to-action.Feel free to go into more detail, but bear in mind that you can get the job done with just a sentence or two (see the example below from Otter.ai).This might seem like a no-brainer, but anything you can do to make your onboarding emails feel a bit less robotic is huge.Chances are your sign-ups have been through the song and dance of an onboarding series before. They know the messages are on autopilot. That doesn’t mean they have to be boring or devoid of any sort of personality, though.Beyond having a distinct voice, some other strategies to make your messages seem more human include:Showcasing actual employees or customer photosHighlighting social proof and positive feedback from your customersSending some of your onboarding emails from an employee account (as noted earlier)If you’re not agonizing over your onboarding emails’ subject lines, you probably should be.It’s well-documented that nearly half of consumers read emails based on the subject lines alone. They’re the barrier-to-entry that determines whether or not your email gets opened, let alone clicked-through.Although generic subject lines (“Step #2: How to use _____”) aren’t necessarily awful, they’re not exactly exciting. On the flip side, here are some actual subject lines of SaaS onboarding emails that pique your interest and make you want to learn more:“You’re in! What do you want to organize?” (from CoSchedule)“Now that you’ve gone PRO…” (Flock)“You’re not getting the Fullstory yet” (Fullstory)“Supercharge your workflow” (Marvel App)“Does your team spend 80% of their time doing this?” (Twist)See how that works?Imagery including your call-to-action buttons and graphics are obviously important to your onboarding emails.That said, they shouldn’t distract from the meat of your message.How so? For example, consider how making emails too “busy” with tons of images, buttons, and links could ultimately overwhelm your reader. Onboarding emails are typically about taking sequential steps, not dumping a bunch of links and graphics and hoping they click on something by sheer luck.Again, many SaaS emails are minimalist. Straight and to the point. This style makes it difficult to miss key information and your subsequent CTA.And with that, we wrap up our guide!There are plenty of moving pieces to your onboarding series. That said, These templates and tips are a solid starting point for any SaaS company.By writing engaging messages that actually draw readers to take action, you’ll be poised for long-term customers rather than sign-ups that bounce.\n"

      "How Canny Bootstrapped to $800K ARR.\n",
      "Canny is a bootstrapped, remote-working, profitable team of seven. In the last month, we hit $800K in annual recurring revenue. A lot of how our company runs today is due to the fact that we never raised money. Instead, we focused on building a stellar product to solve a problem people are willing to pay for.I’d like to emphasize that being bootstrapped doesn’t mean that we’re building a “lifestyle business.” We’re still an ambitious team with aggressive goals—we just do it on our own terms.If you’re considering starting a SaaS business or are recently starting out, you may get something out of our story. Before you take those investor meetings, think about this alternative path.I met my co-founder Andrew while interning at Facebook. Before Canny, we worked together on several small projects. Including, one where we went to a hackathon and won $45,000. It was pretty clear we made a good team.When my internship ended, I went home to finish university. Canny (then called “Product Pains”) started as one of my thesis projects. It was a community for people to give feedback to any product. I was designing it and Andrew was building it. We weren’t taking it very seriously as Andrew was working full-time at Facebook.After I graduated, I moved to California to start my first full-time job at Facebook. I had known for a while that I wanted to start my own company someday, and I let my manager know that. Meanwhile, Andrew wasn’t feeling fulfilled at work. He quit and decided to pick Product Pains back up. A year and a half later, Product Pains had decent usage but still no real business model. That said, we learned a lot about the space and saw a potential path forward. I quit to join Andrew (he likes to say he recruited me) and we transformed Product Pains into Canny, a SaaS tool.Takeaways:Many businesses start off as side projects. It’s a great way to get started without taking the full leap if you’re not ready. It’s also good to see how passionate you are about it. If you aren’t excited about working on it as a side project, you won’t be excited about building it into a business.One thing I’ve learned is that relationships are everything. If you’re working at a big company right now, keep your eyes open. Be aware of people you work well with and who might have that entrepreneurial spirit. Especially if you have complimentary skills. There’s no point in having a co-founder exactly the same as you.You never know where you might meet your co-founder.Product Pains was a result of us trying to solve our own user problem: companies didn’t listen to our feedback. The idea was that we would build public company profiles for users to give feedback. At some point, the companies would have to listen, right?Not really. We had thousands of people posting feedback to Product Pains. However, businesses still weren’t paying attention.Businesses that had Product Pains profiles started asking about a widget they could put on their website. We asked this question changed everything:“Would you pay for that?”As soon as we learned what people would pay for, our brains started ticking. Them handing us money meant that they had a worthwhile problem that needed solving. Canny was going to solve that problem.We quickly learned this was the wrong approach. We needed to identify the exact customer profile we should target and build for them. With that, we refined the product further. Success didn’t happen overnight. We talked to our customers everyday. We kept track of the most common use cases. We listened to feedback using our own feedback tool.Canny hit “ramen profitability” seven months after we launched. It was a great feeling. We eliminated the big reasons startups fail: running out of money. Takeaways:It’s important that we found that focus. We knew we couldn’t serve everyone well if we were trying to solve problems for very different people. Think about charging for your work right away. It’s the best validation. If you want to bootstrap a company, making money is crucial. Pay attention to what kinds of customers benefit the most.Marketing didn’t come very naturally to us. As a result, we never really marketed Product Pains. We could have kept working on Canny for a long time without launching it. Instead, we launched with a very basic MVP and I’m glad we did.We made use of the most-used launch platform, Product Hunt. It went quite well. We priced Canny quite cheap—but it wasn’t free. That was an important signal for us that we were building something valuable.Delaying the launch would’ve meant taking a bigger risk. We could have spent more time building something that people didn’t really want. We were able to validate, iterate, and improve the product with feedback from early customers.After launch, we started writing blog posts. To this day, Andrew and I mostly write about our journey and what we’re learning along the way.It wasn’t great for SEO, but it did start getting our name out there. Along with the “Powered by Canny” link in our product, we were seeing the start of a recognizable brand. By simply telling our story, we were unintentionally building out our brand. Financially, the biggest impact was probably deciding to leave San Francisco and making Canny a remote company. We were able to reduce our living costs by living the digital nomad lifestyle. With low living costs and the salary we both earned at Facebook, we didn’t have to worry about our runway.Takeaways:I was talking to another founder recently about starting Canny. They thought it was interesting that, after being in the Bay Area, we still decided to bootstrap.I didn’t think too much of it at the time. Thinking back now, experiencing Silicon Valley was a big reason why we bootstrapped.We were all too familiar with the lifestyle we’d be signing up for by raising money. Giving away a piece of our company and adopting a “growth at all costs” mindset didn’t sound fun. We wanted to build a company for ourselves, not for other people. The idea of building a business to profitability and running it sustainably was much more attractive. So that’s what we did. By bootstrapping:A lot of people that set out to be entrepreneurs are seeking autonomy. A lot of times, they give away that autonomy by bringing on investors. For us, there’s never pressure to “return the fund.” I asked some teammates who have experience working for venture-backed companies for their thoughts:Elen, who specifically looked to join a smaller team, resonates with the autonomy aspect too. “Our decisions are entirely ours, and so are the consequences of these decisions. I feel like I can genuinely affect the direction and well-being of the company. It makes my work so much more meaningful and engaging on a personal level.”Jacques pointed out that we can focus on true success metrics. “There's no need to create an elaborate display of false success. We can be honest about who we are. There's no need to cherry-pick metrics to make ourselves look more successful.”If we had to point to a “boss,” they would be our customers. Like Jake says, “we can focus on pleasing our customers instead of investors.”We don’t spend money we don’t have. That meant that we didn’t hire until we knew the business was in a good place.Not a must for all bootstrapped businesses, but it works well for us. Competition for talent is fierce. While we can’t compete with salaries in California, we can across the world. We also save on office space.We’re happy with how we’ve built Canny thus far. We’re profitable, which is hard for most VC-backed companies to say. The people who work on Canny own 100% of the business. Takeaways:SaaS companies are great because you don’t need much capital to get started. Your first revenue goal should be offsetting your own costs (AKA being default alive). Bootstrapping is a great way to build a business—as long as you can be accountable to your own goals. You need to be very self-motivated. Having a co-founder helps with this a lot. As first-time founders, we’re learning so much on this journey. We’ve grown from a founders-only team, to a team of seven. We’ve gone from $0 a year, to over $800K a year. We’re stretching ourselves in unfamiliar areas: marketing, sales, and management, among others.Every step of the way has presented challenges.

Important historical data in your account may be lost if payment gets interrupted.Please respond to update payment information.Thank youNotice how they emphasize that if the customer doesn’t take any action, they’re going to lose historical data. Since they sell marketing software, that data is vital for their customers.

Give it a try and hopefully you’ll notice an improvement on your recovered revenue.To take things a step further, research shows that using a person’s name instead of a company name can increase your open rate by up to 35%.And whatever you do, please DON’T send your dunning emails from “donotreply@domain.com”. It puts up a wall between you and customers and makes it seem like you don’t want to talk to them.And like I mentioned earlier, sometimes the reason your customer’s payment didn’t go through isn’t as simple as updating their billing information. So you need to make it easy for them to get in touch with you.Even if the emails are automated, having them sent from a person makes them feel a little more human like this example from Wiza.Hey {Name},Your friends at Kapa99 here.I am writing because it looks like your subscription payment of {Amount} didn't go through.Please update your information here and we'll give it another try.Let us know if you have any questions,—Ka Kei Ho at Kapa99Founder, Kapa99Subject: Your 💳 Visa card ending in 1234 has failedHey {First Name}, Looks like your marketgoo subscription payment of $19.95 didn't go through.Unfortunately your account has insufficient funds.

But as long as your emails have some level of personalization, you’re in a better position to get them opened, read and clicked through.Subject line: Failed payment to Zalster, uh oh.👋 there,I just got a notification of your payment failing with Zalster. How unfortunate! Luckily, this happens to a lot more users than you'd think so don't beat yourself up about it. The bad thing is that your optimizations aren't running if your payment fails.Usually, it has something to do with one of the events below:Have a quick check of what's up and get it fixed so we can get back to growing your business by automating and optimizing your Facebook and Instagram Ads 🚀 💰!Kind regards,EmmaHead of Client SuccessThis email is getting them a 60% open rate, so they’re doing something right.If emojis aren’t your thing, no worries. You can still give life to your dunning emails with words alone, like this example from YL Education Club.Subject: Re: Oh no, there's a problem with your {Company Name} paymentHey {Customer Name}!We are so sad that you are no longer in The YL Education Club, the fastest and easiest way to strengthen your knowledge and accelerate your business.We've been unable to process your payment for {Company Name} using your card ending with {Customer Last 4}. Please take a moment to update your payment information in the YL Ed Club. This ensures that you still have access to videos, business tools, and mentorship.{Billing Link}Thanks so much for your immediate attention to this issue!Thank you!YL Education ClubThe subject line has a human tone, and they show empathy in the first sentence. It’s easy to sound robotic and vanilla with your dunning emails. Using a lighter and empathetic tone is a simple way to make your emails sound more natural.If a customer’s payment doesn’t go through, it doesn’t need to be an “all or nothing” situation. Depending on your pricing model, you can offer customers an alternative to canceling their account due to a failed payment.This is particularly helpful if the reason for the failed charge was insufficient funds.Here are some dunning email examples from other SaaS companies who offer customers alternative solutions to closing their accounts.Social Status downgrades customers to a free plan until they update their billing information.Subject: Please update your payment informationHi there,We were unable to take payment for your EmailOctopus Pro plan, using your Visa card ending in 4321. Can you please take a moment to update your payment information?It's a one-step process and shouldn't take more than a minute. This will ensure that your plan remains active and your existing campaign reports are retained (on the free Starter plan, they're deleted 30 days after the send date).Thanks so much for using EmailOctopus!Best wishes,Tom, COO at EmailOctopusSubject: Second attempt for payment failedHi there,We're still unable to take payment for your EmailOctopus Pro plan using your Visa card ending in 4321.Please note that on our free Starter plan, campaign reports are deleted 30 days after their send date. Updating your payment information will prevent your old reports from being deleted, and will mean you get to keep the many other benefits of your Pro plan.If you're having trouble, please don't hesitate to let me know. Thanks for your immediate attention to this issue.Best wishes,Tom, COO at EmailOctopusSubject: Final warning before downgrade (important)Hi there,I'm Tom, the Chief Operating Officer at EmailOctopus. I hope you're doing well.My team have just let me know me that your account is due to be downgraded to our free Starter plan in the next 72 hours, at which point you'll lose the benefits of your Pro plan. Most importantly, it will mean that any of your campaign reports older than 30 days will be permanently deleted (under the terms of our free Starter plan).In order for your account to remain active, you'll need to update your card in your account settings.If you're having trouble, please let me know as soon as possible.Best wishes,Tom, COO at EmailOctopusI’d only recommend offering a deal like this in certain scenarios though. If the payment failed because the card was expired or they just need to update their billing address, cost isn’t the issue. They have the ability to pay in full, they just need to update their info. So you’d be better off pushing to get them to update their billing information.On the other hand, if the charge failed because they had insufficient funds, then offering a discount to prevent them from churning could be a good compromise.Not everyone checks their email regularly. Plus, like I mentioned earlier, most people get so many emails it’s easy to get overlooked.That’s why instead of just sending dunning emails, you should also set up in-app reminders when a payment hasn’t gone through. If you sell a product that customers log into regularly, this might be even more effective than your emails.Here’s another example. Appointedd sends this in-app message to customers when their payments fail. They also make it easy to ask questions or get more info by using chat.The more communication you have with customers when their payments fail, the better. In-app reminders give you another channel to connect outside of their inbox.Depending on how your product and billing are set up, the primary user might not be the person in charge of paying the bill. This is particularly common with B2B SaaS products.If your software allows for multiple users, it can be helpful to send your dunning emails out to all the emails under the account. That way, you have a higher chance of getting a response and don’t have to wait for one person to forward your email to the right person.That’s exactly what SiteSwan does. They send their dunning emails to all users on the account who have Billing permissions (also notice the loss aversion!):Subject: Urgent! Your account is past dueHi {Account Name},It appears your credit card ending in 7570 has failed to go through. We will automatically try processing the card again in 24 hours. If this card is no longer valid or there are insufficient funds, please update your payment information by logging into your account immediately. Your accounts and sites are at risk of coming offline if your payment does not go through successfully.Update your account here: http://manage.multisiteadmin.com/billingIf you have any questions, please let us know.Thank you,SiteSwanhttp://siteswan.com/1-800-462-9814Don’t miss out on revenue just because you sent your dunning emails to the wrong person.You don’t have to wait for your customer’s payment to fail in order to contact them. To prevent failed payments for expired credit cards, you can be proactive by sending a pre-dunning email.This is an email that lets customers know their credit card will expire soon and they should go in and update it.According to our analysis of almost 300,000 pre-dunning emails, they have a higher success rate than some dunning emails sent after a payment fails.Hi {Customer Name}!As a heads up, the payment information you have on file for your WeVideo subscription (card ending {Customer.Last4}) is going to expire in a few days. Unfortunately, if we don't have a valid card, we will have to cancel your subscription when your term ends.If you've got 30 seconds, would you mind updating your payment information?Please login to your account and click \"Update Payment\" in the account management page. If you have any questions, please see this support article or contact us at support@wevideo.com.Sincerely,The WeVideo TeamAnd here are the pre-dunning emails we send to our customers at Baremetrics.We send this one 30 days before the credit card expiration date.And this is what we send seven days before the card expires.\n"

      "3 Customer Retention Metrics to Measure for Growth.\n",
      "With saturated markets and well funded newbies popping up, competition is fierce. But retention is key to long lasting growth. Once you know how to turn customers into loyalists, they will expand and sustain your business on their own.The common knowledge is it's 5x cheaper and easier to retain a customer than to gain a new one because you don’t have to spend time or resources starting from scratch with a new lead or prospect. Why are we focusing on retention over churn? First let's go over the relationship:This is very simple and slight. They are the same depending on how you frame it—is the glass half empty or half full? Retention is who or how much revenue stays, and churn is who or how much revenue leaves with a given period.There is an immense amount of value in looking at who churned and why they churned, but I’ll point you to this churn analysis piece by Baremetrics to answer those questions while we dig into the glass half full side—retention. If you have a high retention rate, you'll in turn have a low churn rate. However, as the saying goes: cash is king. Retention indicates current and future revenue, which is cash in your account and future runway. If you focus on retention, churn will fall into place.The question is, how do you measure it? In this guide, we’ll go over three common retention metrics you should pay attention to, and how to improve them.Customer retention (aka logo retention) is how many customers you're able to retain, not the revenue from each.It is an unpopular opinion to say that logo retention is important, some people say it’s a vanity metric so people can hide behind the revenue number they're losing. I get it. I said earlier that cash is king, and it still is. But considering the types of customers you are better at retaining may point to the target market your product is more successful with. You'll be able to double down on efforts to retain ideal customers and it will pay off in the long run. It may not be a metric you highlight in the next board meeting, but it can narrow your market focus and lead your sales team to the right segment. It can be a strong signal of product market fit.It depends on who you sell to. The larger your contract size, the higher your customer retention rate should be.To improve retention, you're going to need a killer customer experience and to review your pricing structure. Improving retention means chipping away at that pesky churn problem. Since our friends at Baremetrics dive into the customer experience side of churn that you can read here, I'll focus on the pricing side. If you're facing a churn problem, it might be worth reviewing your pricing. And no, I'm not going to tell you to drop prices or make it hard to cancel so people will forget about it or justify staying. This is not that neglected gym membership.1. Give an incentive if on a freemium model or offer a free upgrade. If someone is ready to throw in the towel, offer them a free upgrade or a discount.This alone will not solve the problems, but it gives your team time to right the wrong and help them get value from your product or service.The other outcome is that they still don't get any value and you get another data point that will lead you to product market fit and further show who you can and cannot work with.2. Incentivize annual billing vs. monthly.This will ensure a customer is with you all year giving you a set time for your CS team to work their magic.A by-product is that it will also help your cashflow since you’ll get all that cash up front. Also, it's MRR you can count on for the whole year.3. Raise your prices.John Doherty, Founder of Credo, said that when he looked into churn data by payment level he found that churn rates for the lowest price tier were about 5x that of the next tier.Credo raised prices without offering anything new and churn plummeted. He learned that the lowest paying customers churn more and take up most of the support time.The last one here that isn't about pricing or CS is to be Product Led. The term “product led growth” was coined by OpenView Partners, and has become a focus for top startups like Slack, Trello, and Zoom. In a product led company, the focus is to build an incredible product and your users will be your sales, marketing, and customer success teams.Now that we've covered customer retention, there are two revenue retention metrics to breakdown and understand. Net revenue retention and gross revenue retention. Let’s start with net revenue retention.It’s the revenue difference in a group of customers over time. Hmm, isn't this getting into cohort analysis?Similar but different, I'll get to cohort analysis in a bit.This chart from Openview Partner’s illustrates it nicely.Or another way to think about it:                                                            Net revenue retention helps understand how MRR/ARR move within an existing customer base. Why does that matter? It tells us what would happen to revenue if a company didn't gain a single new customer. It accounts for the impact of churn as well as the positive impacts of upsells, cross sells, and upgrades. Net  revenue retention is the mile-high revenue view.It's considered a high-level metric because two companies with the same net revenue retention rate can be very different. A company who has high churn but is incredible at upselling and cross selling will face different obstacles than a company with low churn who never adds value over time. In the case of slow months or years, the revenue trends of each will be opposite.While I look at several customer retention metrics including gross revenue churn, logo churn, and subscription renewal rates, if I had to pick only one metric it would be net revenue retention. It immediately tells me if our overall customer base is healthy. (I’m looking for 105%+).A net revenue retention rate of 100% or more leads to exponential growth and is the holy grail for SaaS companies. Anything above 95% and you’re in incredible shape. Shoot for 90% at a minimum and continue working your way up from there.In the simplest terms, gross revenue retention is lost dollars from churned customers.1 - (churned revenue / Total MRR) = Gross revenue retention Keep in mind, this will never exceed 100%, if the number you get is more than that, there’s something missing or off in your calculation.It helps you understand how good your company is at retaining revenue from your customers over time. The more efficient your team is at gross revenue retention, the healthier your growth rate will be and it will withstand any lapse or low months from upsells and cross-sells.It will help you understand which types of customers are leaving as well when you compare to your customer retention. If your customer retention is less than your gross revenue retention, then your smaller contract value customers are the ones leaving you (not necessarily the worst thing).When you’re looking at these three metrics for your company (particularly revenue retention), I recommend doing it in cohorts rather than across all your customers.Cohort analysis is a framework for thinking about these different retention metrics. You can use it to measure the gross or net revenue retention of a group or cohort of customers over time. While cohort analysis is used by the finance experts, it can be broken down and learned by anyone. From the top down in every company, if it's taught well, it’s pretty easy to understand. And since Baremetrics does an incredible job of this, I’ll point you here for a deep dive into analysis. While it can seem daunting to review metrics and rework strategies to improve retention and decrease churn, you can now rely on your newfound knowledge of cohort analysis to do so. The answers for what to do as a company and where to pivot or adjust lie in your own data. If you get stuck, phone a friend to help you out. If all else fails and you’re still feeling stuck, Baremetrics and KPI Sense are only an email or phone call away.\n",

      "Being a Subscription Video On Demand (SVoD) service, subscribers are the lifeblood of our business. And as we are still, very much, the new kid on the block, we need to work hard for every single user we onboard.Therefore, any sharp spike in churn (cancelled subscriptions) can be catastrophic to us.Reflecting on October, things were going well, we were growing 4% month-over-month, but we knew that we could do better. Black Friday was right around the corner and we had a bulletproof marketing plan.The biggest weekend of the year comes and goes, we break all of our records, the numbers keep on climbing and then we hit January...January provided us with that catastrophic spike! There were a lot of questions, a lot of which we didn't have the immediate answers to.So throughout the rest of this article, I will go through how we found the answers to these questions, what tactics we employed, and ultimately how we went about decreasing churn when things were starting to slip away from us.It's around this time that we started using Baremetrics. While using Recurly, we knew exactly how many subscribers were coming and going. However, the depth of knowledge just wasn't there. The ease of integration with Baremetrics made it a no-brainer for us to give it a shot, further our analytical capabilities and start to understand the trends in our subscription data.I am glad to say the insights provided by Baremetrics changed the way that we went about our acquisition and retention, and gave us a better understanding of why our subscribers were leaving.The graphs and tables that Baremetrics can produce make visualising information far easier than simply looking at numbers and spreadsheets.Whilst the ability to annotate graphs has been integral in helping us start to determine trends within our users' behaviour.Returning to Black Friday, we acquired an extraordinary amount of new subscribers during our sale, with these numbers continuing to grow well into December. We were steadily acquiring well under our target Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) of  £30, so we decided to increase our budget on numerous occasions. An example of this was when a major storm hit, we increased our budget substantially to target those stuck at home. This tactic had a great ROI with our CPA dropping to £15 over that weekend.We found that duplicating this tactic in similar circumstances worked well initially. However, we quickly noticed that we couldn't rely on this tactic and that it had a kickback effect on the number of subscribers cancelling their subscription. The cancellation rate started to rise rapidly - up from 6% to 9% in a matter of weeks.Whilst our cancellation rate was increasing, we also noticed a large number of trialists churning out. It was evident that we could acquire customers with ease, but we needed to seriously work on our retention techniques, starting with our onboarding process.Using Recurly, we were limited to simply tracking the number of subscribers, our Monthly Recurring Revenue, and Churn Rate. Armed with these statistics alone we were severely underprepared—when this happened—to properly understand our customers' behaviour and start fighting churn.This resulted in us undertaking a thorough analysis of our data. Within this, we were able to pinpoint the three biggest metrics that we needed to monitor when dealing with customer churn.Customer Lifetime Value - Our monthly LTV peaked at £68 in November but quickly dropped to £43 within a month.Cancellations - Our total cancellations rose from ~350 - ~530 during December.Trial Conversion Rate - Our conversion rate dropped from 80% to 40% in the space of a fortnight.Once we had identified the key metrics that we needed to monitor to stay on top of churn, we were then tasked with identifying what was causing these negative effects.It’s important to group certain metrics to begin understanding how you can start fighting churn with data. For example, it wasn't until we were able to visualise our data on graphs that we started to notice the following trends.A lucrative sale hurt the retention of our existing customersThe end of a sale had a catastrophic effect on the number of trialists cancellingAn extended trial period simply meant that customers had more opportunity to leave us without ever becoming a paying subscriberWhen identifying trends, it’s important to not just look at data, but start identifying what external causes impacted user behaviour. Some fundamental factors that must be considered are:What marketing activities were undertaken?What promotions were available?What product & service amendments were made?You must acknowledge all internal and external factors when viewing your data as these will provide context and reasoning to any abstract behaviour that you uncover.As mentioned above, our key churn metrics are CLV, subscription cancellations, and trial conversion rate. So when we noticed negative trends in all of these areas, we kickstarted our battle to start fighting churn.Our rapidly decreasing CLV was perhaps the most worrying statistic of all. In the space of under two weeks, it decreased by 33%. We pored over the numbers and were able to identify the key contributing factor—the end of customers free trial period. Our cost per acquisition soared above £30 so we began to make very slim profits from acquiring new customers.The number of cancelled subscriptions increased substantially over a few months. This was a direct result of our previous marketing strategy where we would entice customers by offering significant discounts due to our lack of accessible marketing budget. We saw a sharp increase of ~66% in cancellations in the space of a month and unfortunately, it settled at this higher plateau. Thankfully, our churn rate remained constant due to increased acquisition, however, the absolute churn was steadily rising to an almost untenable level.Our trial conversion rate provided two interesting figures upon inspecting the data. We saw that during a sale, the cancellation rate of existing customers was far higher. However, when that sale finished, our conversion rate rapidly dropped from 80% to 40% - this happened on numerous occasions last year. We were also able to identify that similar offers that afforded users a longer trial period (6-weeks) also led to a much lower conversion rate than those whose trial period was our regular length of 30-days.We had now identified the cause of our churn, so we needed to plan, create, and implement a solution; and fast.The solution for any start-up is to test quickly and learn quicker. Thankfully, we were able to do this rapidly and can attribute our success in reducing churn to how quickly we were able to learn and adapt our processes.To do this, we went back to the basics. This alone, however, would never have been enough—although we were able to reduce some of the impacts of the trends mentioned above.The key to understanding a lot of our issues was Platform Saturation. When we saw our CPA balloon, we were able to conclude that we had reached the upper limit for the number of times an ad could be shown to our audience. The frequency our ads were being shown to individual users on Facebook and Twitter was detrimental to the point that we were receiving comments from some of our followers.Over time, we were able to return our acquisition and CPA to the levels they were previously. However, we had failed at breaking through to the next level. By contacting many recently churned customers we were able to discover two key factors leading to churn:We decided to action this feedback and test some new platforms. Reddit, for example, was one such test. As a non-user, we were going into this blind. Knowing the platform was unique, we read as much about the platform as we could, including what tone, message, creative, and copy to use in ads. However, we were still shocked by the response. No-one had warned us that users hated ads and would troll the comments. It wasn't until we had a conversation with our account manager that we learnt this lesson.Our success metric had been defined by a target number of users signing up using the code 'reddit'. However, even with a groundbreaking archaeological find - the largest cache of World War Two artefacts found since the war - and the right audience 'r/history', we still weren't able to see the results that we sought after.This platform taught us a lesson by showing us the key to success when testing new platforms is being prepared. To avoid failure you must ensure that you not only know how a platform is used, but also how businesses advertise upon it, and further how users react to such advertisements.Instagram is another platform that we found to work well for us. However, our campaign was only successful due to the work that we had put in on other channels. Having an influencer as a founder enables a certain level of clout, with Dan (Snow) being one of the biggest names in history and amassing over 280K followers on Twitter. It was on this platform that we were able to hone our social media messaging.However, it was Instagram that proved the biggest challenge for us. It is a lot harder to generate advertising that looks native on Instagram than it is on other channels, and as a result of this, we saw our initial CPA 3-4x higher than what we had expected. This was a large set-back initially with us questioning the feasibility of advertising on the platform for our business. However, when we applied our learnings from other platforms we saw these pay dividends on Instagram. Facebook taught us which creative &  resonated best with our audience and Twitter provided us with a basis for successful copy, which we were able to adapt and improve for the relevant platform.The key to our success came from the diversification of audiences across our social media platforms. We were able to constantly test specific history interests on Facebook efficiently, whilst finding which ads converted best for particular audiences. We were then able to match this data with conversion rates across all ad-sets to duplicate any ads into new ad groups that we were confident would succeed. The success of scaling our advertising on both Twitter and Instagram came from the creation of several Lookalike Audiences to those that have proven conversions.For us to be successful, we had to ensure that we had clear goals and metrics when testing a new channel. In conjunction with a defined success metric and a set timeframe, we were able to gain a much clearer insight into a channel's scalability. We also found that the best way for our company to adopt this was to ensure that it was in writing. That way, not only did we have a record of it, but we were also able to hold ourselves accountable to it when reviewing our results.By diversifying our marketing output and tapping into different advertising channels and audiences, we were able to greatly decrease the frequency by which our audience saw our ads, and thus decreased churn.Decreasing churn is a constant battle for all subscription businesses and we are no different. By following the steps outlined in this article, we were able to set our business back on the right track. We identified what our key metrics were, identified trends in our data, and actively worked on implementing tactics to counteract these.One of the key findings for us was that it is much easier to retain subscribers who are on an annual subscription than those on a monthly plan.To compare, our annual retention rate is ~80% after 12 months, dropping only 10% to ~70% after 24 months, whereas our monthly retention rate drops to 50% after only 6 months.Therefore, we realised that it was essential to upgrade our monthly users onto an annual plan. The only question left was how.To answer this question we revisited our existing customer feedback and set about obtaining some deeper insights. It is crucial to gather feedback from customers at all stages of their lifecycle to understand any issues or pain points they may have. For us, this included obtaining feedback on sign-up, during onboarding, whilst active, after upgrading, and on exit. Similar to data analysis, it’s essential to notice trends in customer feedback. We found that the reason that people were unsubscribing is because they were meeting the same criteria that ultimately led to our monthly subscribers' upgrading - watching at least 2 hours of content per month.The biggest insight that we uncovered when tackling churn came from the data we were able to gather from users who had recently upgraded from a monthly to an annual subscription. We found that the minimum amount of time for a user to convert their trial was to watch at least 2 hours of content, whilst upgrading to an annual subscription came from constant engagement with our users and a properly nurtured relationship.To address the first issue, we created new playlists that promoted our best content across a variety of historical eras - which we found to increase viewership by 30%. We also found that 50% of our users viewed our programmes on a PC, so we began promoting our mobile & TV apps across our owned channels and saw incremental increases in total playviews as a result.To build deeper relationships with our customers, we reconfigured our onboarding email chain. This included further personalisation and asking for initial feedback after the first fortnight.We also began calling cohorts of users who did and did not complete their trial who signed up at the same time.To action this feedback, we began by reducing the trial period which instantly led to an increase in our trial conversion rate and was linked to a decreased churn rate within the first three months.Other issues that were highlighted related to the long winded onboarding process and lack of personalisation in our product.We were able to take the lack of personalisation feedback and develop new strategies for how we bundled and presented the content on our website. We built more cohesive playlists, and niche collections for our audience. Furthermore, we created a host of new playlists targeting school teachers and students alike, by matching our playlists with their curriculum. These changes were well received, as we began to see less negative feedback about a lack of variety and personalised subject matter.We were able to decrease churn by attending to the major obstacles at each stage of the customer journey, and applying the findings from our subscription data. By undertaking a holistic approach to fighting churn, we were required to interpret raw figures, acknowledge customer feedback, and make alterations to our marketing activities for the project to work.If we focussed on a single aspect of this or were to omit any of these three areas then we would not have been able to succeed in the way that we have.Some key lessons that we learned from this include:\n"

      "How a Social Media Software Company Retains Customers by Building Relationships.\n",
      "In a technology driven world, where it feels like consumers are always looking for the next best service or software to jump ship to, reducing churn can be challenging for a SaaS company like Emphatic. We use Baremetrics to keep track of churn on a monthly, yearly, and even daily basis. Using that data, we attempt to tackle churn in five different ways: I’ll dive into each of these and provide examples of how we use these tactics to combat churn. Emphatic is a social media automation software, similar to Hootsuite or Buffer. But we not only automatically post to our clients’ social media pages, we also curate and write the posts for them. Emphatic has been around since 2014, but changed leadership in January of 2019. When we took over, Emphatic had just over 100 users on the platform, and about $24,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR). In 14 months, we have grown Emphatic to more than 850 users and expect to eclipse $90,000 in MRR soon! As a software company, we understand how hard it can be to circumnavigate or learn a new software platform, especially if you are switching from one you’ve used for years. This is why we offer free training, workshops, and additional bonuses, both for trial users and long-time users. Since we are a social media automation software, a lot of our additional content is focused around things such as: Growing your following on different social media platformsHow to calculate return-on-investment (ROI) on organic social media campaigns Identifying your target audience on social mediaBasically, anything that will supplement what we are already offering. This same strategy can be applied to any business, as long as the bonus material you are offering helps them in addition to what your service is currently delivering for them.Here are some examples of some of the bonus materials we have offered:Now, this may seem like an obvious option, but you would be surprised how many SaaS companies don’t do this with their users. How many times have you gotten a charge from something and not even realized where it came from? Then, you check your email to find nothing from them? It happens often. At Emphatic, we pride ourselves on transparency and staying in contact with our users. First, we offer live chat via Intercom on our website for any organic visitors who might have questions (pictured below), as well as inside our software so our users can address any issues they might have or also ask questions.We believe this goes a long way because we are always available (Monday-Friday, 8am to 4:30pm CST) and respond to every inquiry we get. Availability has been something our long-time users point to as a reason they stick with us, even when things aren't 100% perfect. In addition to our availability via chat on the website, we also have an email onboarding sequence for every trial user, whether they came on through a special promotion or they just organically found our website. During this trial sequence, we send the user a series of emails. The series walks them through how to set up their account properly to get the full experience, as well as a warning on when their trial is about to expire if they wish to cancel. We also send our paying users an email update twice a month to remind them about things that are happening at Emphatic, as well as any new updates about the software and tips/tricks they can take advantage of in their account. Below you can find an example of one of the trial emails we send our users:Referral and affiliate programs are a great way to offer your long-time users the ability to earn additional income or free perks in your business/software. This does two things: Let’s users know that you care about them Reduces churn because setting up an affiliate program gives them an incentive to stick around Every single Emphatic user has the ability to share a special link in their account that gives the user they referred 10% off their first month and also gives them an additional free 25 posts which they can use however they choose. If users want a more rewarding affiliate program, we also set up income earning affiliate/referral programs for users where they get 10% of every user they refer for every month they are with us. These affiliates get their own landing page and special plans created for tracking. We set these up for any Emphatic user that expresses interest and again allows them to create an additional revenue stream for their business. Like email communication, this may seem like a no brainer. But you’d be surprised to find out how many companies don’t do this, whether it be inadvertently or on purpose. At Emphatic, we understand that things break, especially when it comes to software and technology. Any time a user comes to us with an issue, whether it be a post not going out or difficulty linking one of their social media accounts, we troubleshoot the issue.If we find out that the user did everything and the error still happened, we know that there was an issue with our software and we immediately own up to the mistake. Depending on the scenario, we will tie in our tech team so they can get to the bottom of it and we can provide the user some clarification on why this happened and how to prevent it in the future. If the issue caused them to miss part of what they paid for or majorly impacted their account, then we offer some sort of recoup for their account. It could be extra posts for the month or a discount on future or even partial refunds for that month. This shows our customers that we care, and even though we lose some revenue in the short term, it’s cheaper than having them cancel. The worst thing any business can do is stay complacent. As a software company, we understand that we always need to be looking to adapt and add new features to our platform for users. The most recent thing we added was blog writing services for our clients. We heard from a few of our bigger clients saying, “Hey! You already write our social media posts for us. Can you write blogs for our site that you can also use to share on social media?” A light bulb went off in my head after hearing it so many times and began offering it as a service after a few weeks of implementation. Listening to the needs and wants of your customers is the easiest way to add new features to keep them around. In your update emails that you are sending to customers, ask them for their feedback from time to time. It can be informal or through a survey, and use this information to make improvements to your business that your current customers want. This is one of the easiest ways to keep them around longer and reduce churn. In fact, our development team is working on a new version of the software based on feedback from our clients and writers right now. Obviously, there are numerous other tactics to reduce churn that we utilize at Empathic, but these five main points have helped us grow tremendously over the last 14 months and also allowed us to keep these new users on board longer.Hope you can use some of these in your day-to-day business practices!\n",

      "Revenue churn answers the question: how much MRR did we lose last month?Your answer says a lot about the long term health of your company as a SaaS or subscription business.The SaaS business model is built on the concept of retaining as much of your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) as possible. Even if you’re bringing in new customers and more MRR each month, it’s hard to achieve long term growth if you can’t get your churn under control.Revenue churn is the percentage of your MRR lost over a specified period of time. To keep things simple, we’ll just assume you’re calculating your revenue churn monthly.It includes revenue lost from customer cancellations, failed charges and downgrades. In other words, any recurring revenue you got last month that didn’t carry over to the next month.You might’ve noticed that the gross revenue churn formula doesn’t account for any new revenue you gained over the month.For instance, you may have lost $5K in MRR to cancellations, but gained $7K MRR from upgrades.If you want to know the difference between what you gained and lost, you’re going to need to calculate your net revenue churn rate.The difference between revenue churn and customer churn rate is pretty simple. Customer churn is the percentage of customers who’ve cancelled in a given period, and revenue churn is the percentage of lost revenue from your existing customers.To put it in even simpler terms:Don’t make the mistake of fixating solely on your customer churn rate. Just because customers aren’t cancelling doesn’t mean you’re not losing money. Downgrades can have a big impact over time if you don’t keep an eye on it.That’s why you need to pay just as much attention to your revenue churn as you do to customer churn.Say you have a revenue churn rate of 3%. Is that good? Bad? Normal? Without some sort of baseline or benchmark, it’s almost impossible to tell. Even if you use your previous numbers as a benchmark, how do you know if it’s good or bad compared to similar companies?While there’s no definitive answer, we (Baremetrics) are trying to help companies get a better idea of how their revenue churn stacks up. You can take a look at our Open Benchmarks page to see how your revenue churn compares to companies that have a similar average revenue per user (ARPU).And if you’re a Baremetrics user (which you totally should be) you can compare your revenue churn to others directly in your dashboard.Net negative revenue churn is when your expansion revenue is greater than the MRR you lost from cancellations and downgrades.For instance, let’s say you started out with $10,000 in MRR at the beginning of the month. You lost $500 in MRR from cancelled customers and downgrades. But you gained $1,000 MRR from your existing customers upgrading their accounts.Let’s plug those numbers into the revenue churn formula:That gives us a net revenue churn rate of -5%. So even though you lost some revenue, you still came out ahead.It’s a huge achievement, but it’s possible (we even did it!)As a SaaS business, the goal is to retain as much of your monthly revenue as possible. It’s essential to your growth. So no matter what your current revenue churn rate is, there’s always room for improvement. Even if you have a negative churn rate, you can still get it lower.Let’s take a look at some tactics you can use to reduce churn.If a lot of your revenue churn comes from customer downgrades, it could be a sign your pricing is off. Luckily, it’s pretty easy to spot.I’ll show you how in Baremetrics.Head to the Revenue Churn dashboard. If you scroll down you can see the revenue churn for each of your different pricing plans.Look for any plans with unusually high revenue churn rates. These are the ones that are losing you the most MRR.To take it a step further, you can use Cancellation Insights to see why people on your high-churn plans are cancelling. Cancellation Insights automatically asks customers why they’re cancelling and collects the feedback for you.If you see a lot of responses like “too expensive” or “switching to a competitor”, don’t assume that means you need to lower your price. It could just be that you’re not providing enough value for the price you’re charging (your value:price ratio).That’s when you should take a look at what your competitors are offering for around the same price point.For instance, Ahrefs, Moz and SEMrush all offer a $99 plan, so people looking for an SEO tool within that budget are likely going to compare the features of all three to see where they get the most value. And you can bet they’re doing the same with your product.Another thing you can do is try to reduce revenue churn by preventing cancellations altogether.In Cancellation Insights, you can create custom emails to send to users who want to cancel, based on their cancellation reason.For example, if a customer chooses “Too expensive” as their cancellation reason, you could send an automated email offering them a discount coupon.It’ll still result in revenue churn, but not as much as you’d lose if they were to cancel completely.Create responses for each of your cancellation reasons, and see if there’s anything you can do to prevent the customer from churning.Here are a couple of resources to help you out:We’ve written about expansion revenue quite a bit at Baremetrics:It’s such an important, yet underutilized SaaS growth strategy that can have an immediate impact on your net revenue churn.Your first priority should be to retain as much revenue as possible. But like we saw in the net negative revenue churn example, expansion can balance out some of the inevitable lost MRR.The main three ways to increase your expansion MRR are:Here’s a graphic to help you visualize each one.Your opportunities for expansion MRR will depend on your business.But typically for SaaS companies, the easiest path is through upgrades. Offer your existing customers more value if they decide to upgrade to a higher priced plan.In order to be successful at it though, the extra value needs to be compelling. A good example of this is Shopify. Their Basic Shopify plan is enough to get your online store off the ground and covers the basics. But when you compare that to the upgraded plans, you can see the additional value you get like additional features and lower fees.That’s an easy sell for Shopify: “Earn more money from your sales by upgrading your account”.Read through my customer expansion guide to learn more about increasing expansion MRR, and to see more examples.If you continue to show your customers how to get value from your product, they’re more likely to stick around. But you need to be proactive, not reactive.What I mean is don’t wait until your customers come to you with questions or complaints about how to use your product. Give them articles, videos and resources that show different product use cases and tips on a regular basis.This is an area we’re starting to focus on more at Baremetrics. But a company that’s already doing a good of it is SpamZilla. It’s a tool that helps you find expired domains to buy. After you sign up, they send you a series of emails that teach you how to use the product and all the things you can do with it.Get it straight! #CanvaTip 📏\n",

Do what you can to make sure customers are successful with your product after they sign up.Churn can be the death of SaaS and subscription businesses (really any business with a monthly recurring revenue model).In order to keep yours under control, or even hit net negative revenue churn, here’s a quick recap of what to do:While it’s going to take some time to see the decrease in your revenue churn, these are all things you can implement right away. The faster you take action, the more revenue you’ll be able to retain long term.\n"
